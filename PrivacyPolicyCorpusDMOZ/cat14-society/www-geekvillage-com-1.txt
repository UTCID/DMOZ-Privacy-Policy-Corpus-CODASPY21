Privacy Policy For GeekVillage.com
We
respect your privacy. Your Email address and any other data
you provide us will never be released to a third party. All
our Email lists and Membership forms use the Opt-In model. These
Emails always include a procedure and instructions to remove
yourself from our lists. We do use "cookies" on this site. We
use "cookies" to retain your user name and password for our
geek/talk Bulletin Board and in our Contests, Polls, Quizzes,
and Surveys.
Certain
sections of this site log and display your IP number. This includes
our geek/talk Forums For Webmasters. IP numbers are not secret
and have been used for years. Every site you visit logs and
often displays your IP number. We use this procedure for your
protection as well as our own. It helps us protect our members
from abuse, permits members of our Bulletin Board to "flush"
impostors and "Abusers", provides us with the additional
evidence to aggressively pursue "Abusers", and acts
as a deterrent for "Abusers". If you use a Broadband
connection to the Web such as Cable or DSL, you should install
a firewall on your system to protect it from third party abuse.
We have received good reports about ZoneAlarm,
BlackICE,
and the Linksys
Router. Then check the integrity of your system using Shields
UP. If our IP procedures still make you nervous or are inconsistent
with your wishes, please leave our site and do not return.
This
is how we will handle information we learn about you from your
visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon
what you do when visiting our site. If you visit our site we
collect and store only the following information about you:
the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton
University's domain); the date and time you access our site;
and the Internet address of the website from which you linked
directly to our site. We use the information we collect to measure
the number of visitors to the different sections of our site,
and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.
Any data which we collect will only be used by ourselves. We
reserve the right to transfer any data collected in the event
we sell this site or any other site which we own.
We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying
information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose
to provide such information to us.
Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act
Our Compliance Statement and Procedures
Although we have no knowledge of any children under the age
of 13 using any service or subscribing to any service on this
site which may fall under the purview of this law we have chosen
to implement our full and absolute compliance with this law.
We think this law is good and children under the age of 13 need
protection.
If you are under 13 years of age please do not subscribe
to any of our Email lists or register for our geek/talk Bulletin
Board and or use any service on this site which requires your
"personnel information". The next paragraph explains this
in more detail.
If you are under the age of 13 and you see any service on this
site which collects the following information, please do not
use it or submit any data. This includes a service on this site
which asks for your name, home address, e-mail address, telephone
number, hobbies, interests, and a request for any other information
that would allow someone to identify or contact a child under
the age of 13. If you have any questions about our compliance
procedures, please Email
us.
