DISPUTES
Weleda, Inc. is committed to resolving all disputes in a fair, effective, and cost-efficient manner.  We seek to resolve any customer concerns through our Customer Support services at 1.800.241.1030.  If you are dissatisfied with our Customer Support service’s resolution of your matter, however, these Terms and Conditions provide that any dispute, controversy, or claim relating in any way to your use of any Weleda, Inc. service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Weleda, Inc. through usa.weleda.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.  Our arbitration agreement, which is set forth below, has been designed to make arbitration as convenient and inexpensive to our customers as possible.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
Weleda, Inc. and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us before a single arbitrator. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to Weleda, Inc. includes Weleda, Inc.’s respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under Terms and Conditions or any prior agreement between us. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, and must follow the Terms and Conditions as a court would.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.  We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") to the other party. A Notice to Weleda, Inc. should be addressed: Notice of Dispute, Weleda, Inc., 1 Bridge St Suite 42, Irvington, NY 10533. The Notice should describe the claim or dispute and set forth specific relief sought.  If you and Weleda, Inc. do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received by us, you or Weleda, Inc. may commence an arbitration proceeding.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. You may download or copy a form to initiate arbitration from the AAA website (http://adr.org) under the "Forms" tab. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, Weleda, Inc. will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. You and we agree that any awards or findings of fact or conclusions of law made in an arbitration of their dispute or claim are made only for the purposes of that arbitration and may not be used by any other person or entity in any later arbitration of any dispute or claim involving Weleda, Inc. You and we agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither of us will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of any dispute or claim to which we were a party.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential, other than as part of an appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
