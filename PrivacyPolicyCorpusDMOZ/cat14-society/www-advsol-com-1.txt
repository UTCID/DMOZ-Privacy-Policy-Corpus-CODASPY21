Areas of the Website and Acceptable Use
The information in the public areas of the Website is summary information and not technical information and all Products and Services are sold or licensed based only on their technical written specifications as found on docs.imis.com.
All sales or licensing of Products is under the terms of our Usage Agreement or License Agreement for ASI Products and all Services are performed under the terms of our Master Services Agreement.

The information in our Solution Providers areas is provided as a service to our Solution Providers, including our Authorized Resellers and Authorized Consultants. Technical information is provided with the expectation that the Solution Provider is highly skilled in its tasks and should be used with care since each site is unique. Our liability is limited as detailed in the Solution Provider Agreement, Services Agreement or other agreement with the Solution Provider.
The information in our employee areas is part of our Intranet and it is confidential and proprietary and only authorized employees are permitted to access or download it.
We host a number of Forums for End-Users (including Solution Providers) to exchange information and help each other.
Forums, including blogs, wiki's, books, polls, projects and traditional posting forums, are interactive pages where the reader is able to enter information for others to see.
Some are commercial Forums used mainly to advertise products being sold by Solution Providers (our Solution Providers independently resell our products or services as well as their own products and services).
The views expressed in such posts belong solely to their respective authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of ASI.
Goods and services advertised in Forums are not endorsed, reviewed or advocated by us. Investigate them thoroughly and buy and use them at your own risk.
We are not responsible for any messages posted on these Forums or the consequences of following any advice offered with Forum posts.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, truthfulness, content or use of any message posted on a Forum. If a message is posted by an ASI employee that identifies him/her as being an employee (e.g., ASI-Consulting) but does not say "on behalf of ASI", then the message is from the person as an individual and not from ASI as a company and the reference to ASI is for identification purposes only.
All messages that you post are assumed to be in the public domain and can be read, copied and republished by anyone without any restrictions. If this is not true for a particular message, you must state so explicitly in the message. All messages that we post, however, are subject to all of the restrictions of the Website, including copyright and access.
Any information that you post is at your own risk. We do not enforce copyright protection and often posting ideas, program fragments or entire programs may cause you to lose any trade secret protection you had in the ideas, algorithms or coding methods. We can make commercial use of these ideas or code, ourselves, including developing and marketing products or services using such information. If you are selling goods or services, we do not collect for you nor create or enforce any agreements between you and your prospect or customer.
By posting messages, uploading files, inputting data or engaging in any other form of communication through one or more of the Forums, you grant ASI, its successors and assignees, a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to continue to display your contributions to the Website or any successor site.
ASI reserves the right to delete any contribution and/or restrict posting rights in our Forums for any reason whatsoever and to take any other action, as allowed by law, we deem necessary if a user posts contributions to the Forums that are false, misleading, inaccurate or illegal or reflects behavior that ASI considers to be abusive, malicious, harassing or threatening or may otherwise violate the Terms of Use.
Any use or attempted use of this Website for any unlawful, unauthorized, fraudulent or malicious purpose, including any attempt to access systems, data or information not intended by ASI to be made accessible to a user, is prohibited.
