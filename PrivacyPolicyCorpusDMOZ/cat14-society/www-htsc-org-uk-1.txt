Vital interests – if you have a life-threatening medical emergency, we may disclose personal data if we have it such as date of birth, next of kin and medical details to emergency services if this would help your care
Consent – if none of the above conditions apply, we will ask for your consent to process your data
Some of the data we process may fall under the ‘special categories’ of data, mainly religious belief, and medical conditions for children or vulnerable adults. Special care will be taken with this data and it will not be shared outside the church without your consent

Your data may be held in the Parish Office or the Rectory office, but In common with many other organisations which rely on a large number of volunteers, some personal data will be held by members of the church in their homes. The Data Protection Policy ensures that this data is held, processed and deleted securely. Your data might be stored or processed on secure third party systems.
