Introduction
This bibliography lists articles on legal aspects of the AIDS epidemic in academic law reviews, bar
journals, legal newspapers, and some books published from 1983 through the date indicated on the Cover.
This cannot be considered comprehensive, because so much is appearing about AIDS that it is likely
something has escaped the compiler's attention along the way.
Only articles that actually mention and
discuss AIDS are included.
Excluded are articles which generally discuss handicap discrimination law or
other issues without mentioning AIDS implications, and most of the numerous articles dealing generally
with implications of the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act but not including a significant
AIDS focus.
Most entries are assigned to one category, although in some cases the title made it evident that an
article belonged in more than one category, and it was so assigned.
Due to subject matter overlap, the
placement of some articles was arbitrary.
Almost everything in the "General" category covers two or more
of the other categories, but many articles listed under "General" have not been listed elsewhere, since their
discussion of any one substantive area tends to be cursory.
Many articles on handicap discrimination law
are listed under "Employment Law," but researchers on this issue should also examine the "General"
category.
Student Articles - Beginning during the summer of 1992, student authors of notes and comments are
identified in parentheticals at the end of entries, as per the 16th edition of the Uniform System of Citation.
However, such articles are listed alphabetically under their generic description, i.e., Note, Comment, Recent
Development, etc.

continuing coverage of AIDS issues.
