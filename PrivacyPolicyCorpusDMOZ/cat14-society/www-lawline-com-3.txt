Lawline’s Professional Community Policies
By submitting Content, you acknowledge that you have read the following Professional Community Policies and that you shall comply with them.
Be Professional. We acknowledge the value of discussions around professional activities and ask our members to behave professionally by not being dishonest or inappropriate. When creating content on the Profile Page, we ask that you keep your content professional, relevant, and on-topic. Do not share false information or use the Profile Pages to shock or intimidate others. Sharing graphic, obscene, or pornographic content on the Profile Pages is also prohibited.
Be Nice. We strive to maintain a safe and friendly community for our members. The Profile Pages shouldn't be used to harm others or their career or business prospects, or to air personal grievances and disputes. It is not acceptable to use the Profile Pages to harass, abuse, or send other unwelcome communications to people (e.g., romantic advances, sexually explicit content, junk mail, spam, chain letters, phishing schemes). We do not allow hate speech acts such as attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliations, or medical or physical condition. Also, hate groups, terrorists, and those who engage in violent crimes are not welcome and not permitted on the Profile Pages.
Respect Others' Rights and Follow the Law. Before sharing or using someone else's copyrighted works, trademarks, confidential information, personally identifiable information, or trade secrets, you must ensure that you have the legal right to do so. The Profile Pages should not be used for illegal activities, promoting illegal products, or to violate the rights of others. Do not use the Profile Pages to commit fraud or to try to trick others.

Terms & Conditions for People Viewing Lawline Profile Pages
Information on the Lawline Profile Pages
Our Lawline Profile Pages (“Profile Pages”) display both Lawline-created content and content that is not created or developed by Lawline (the latter is referred to as "Legal Information"). We may review third party-content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. However, we do not routinely screen third-party content that is published via our Profile Pages. This includes the Legal Information that lawyers post on Lawline’s Profiles, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy, adequacy, or quality of any such Legal Information or the qualifications of those posting it.
No Formation of an Attorney-Client Relationship
The Legal Information found on Lawline’s Profile Pages is intended for general informational purposes only and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues. Accessing the Legal Information, corresponding with or asking questions to a lawyer via the Profile Pages, or otherwise using the Profile Pages does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and Lawline or you and any Profiled lawyer. It is not a substitute for an in-person or telephonic consultation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific legal issue, and you should not rely on such Legal Information for that purpose.
