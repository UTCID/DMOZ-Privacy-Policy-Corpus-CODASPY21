Years have passed since 9/11, yet our nation still faces the challenge of remaining both safe and free. Our choice is not, as some would have it, between safety and freedom. The ACLU of Utah works to protect a diverse group of rights, including the right to privacy, to be free from unreasonable government surveillance.
