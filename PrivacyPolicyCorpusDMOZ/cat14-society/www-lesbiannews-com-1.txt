We strive to provide an enjoyable online experience for our users, so we may monitor activity on the Service, including in the social, community and public discussion areas, photo and video galleries, bulletin boards, forums, chats, blogs, personal/job search and other classified ads, and elsewhere, to foster compliance with the Agreement. You hereby specifically agree to such monitoring. Nevertheless, we do not make any representations, warranties or guarantees that: (1) the Service, or any portion thereof, will be monitored for accuracy or unacceptable use, (2) apparent statements of fact will be authenticated, or (3) we will take any specific action (or any action at all) in the event of a challenge or dispute regarding compliance or non-compliance with the Agreement. We generally do not pre-screen Content before it is posted, uploaded, transmitted, sent or otherwise made available on or through the Service by users, so you may be exposed to Content that is opinionated, offensive, and/or inappropriate, including Content that violates the Agreement.
2. What to Do if You Have a Complaint Against Another User
Remember that by using the publicly accessible portions of our Service you may be exposed to Content that is opinionated, offensive, and/or inappropriate, including Content that violates the Agreement, but not all of such Content is actionable. We ask that you not use the Service, or lodge complaints against other users, to facilitate a personal dispute. If you have a legitimate complaint about another user, please do the following:
Harassment: If you have reason to believe that another person is using the Service in a way that is harmful to you (e.g., to impersonate or imitate you, or to stalk, bully, threaten, intimidate or otherwise harass you), we urge you to contact your local authorities, or appropriate state or federal agencies.
Copyright Complaints: If you have reason to believe that your Content has been copied and/or is accessible on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that the Service contains links or other references to another site, application, destination or service that contains Content or activity that infringes your copyright rights, you may notify us as described below in the section entitled Copyright Complaints.
CyberCrime: If you have reason to believe you may be the victim of an online crime, such as identity theft, fraud, infringement, or hacking, you may contact the Internet Crime Complaint Center, at www.ic3.gov, a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA).

Subscriptions to LN may be FREE or PREMIUM. All Premium Subscriptions are automatically renewing except where applicable. This means that once you subscribe to products and/or services offered on subscription basis or become a premium subscribing member, your premium subscription will be automatically renewed and your billing method will be charged based on the subscription program (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, etc.) you have chosen unless you opt out or cancel by following the instructions in this Terms. Please ensure that you correct any information which has changed in respect to your payment method to prevent your subscription lapsing due to us being unable to process your payment. Billing charges will be processed immediately when your order is taken and according to the billing details displayed when you choose a subscription, as well as when your subscription is automatically renewed. The renewal of the subscription takes place subject to the terms and conditions in force on the date of renewal. When other offers, promotions or free trials are made available, the specific terms and conditions that apply to each will be stated at the time of purchase; please ensure you have noted any relevant rules, cancellation dates or price changes when a promotion or free trial ends.
You may opt-out of renewing your premium subscription by canceling your subscription via your PayPal account. We recommend that you cancel your subscription at least two business days prior to the end of the current subscription period so that the payment for the renewal period of the subscription will not be processed.
If you subscribe for a free trial whenever offered, you may cancel at any time during the free trial period and incur no charge. Monthly subscriptions may be canceled at any time but are not eligible for a refund. For annual, semi-annual, and quarterly subscriptions where the entire subscription amount is billed at one time, you may cancel during the first 7 days and receive a full refund. Cancellation beyond the given 7 days cancellation period is not eligible for any refund. If you cancel your subscription but are not eligible for a refund, you will retain access to the applicable website product or service until your subscription expires.
If you do not wish to continue with your subscription, you may opt out of renewal or cancel your subscription via the PayPal account you used during sign up. On your PayPal’s Transaction History you’ll find the subscription details, which you can view and cancel. You will be asked to confirm cancellation and you will receive a confirmation that the subscription has been canceled, cannot be reactivated, and that no more recurring payments will be made.
