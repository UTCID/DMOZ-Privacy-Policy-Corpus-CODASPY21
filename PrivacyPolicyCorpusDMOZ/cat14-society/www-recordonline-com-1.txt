Today’s Workout column: Step back lunge helps balance, stabilityMarlo AllevaMore Content NowStrength in our lower bodies is not only good for us but is a necessity for everyday life. In addition to walking, we sit and stand, bend and squat, lean and lunge, and everything else in between. All of those motions require leg strength, and to attain that, variety is key.Our move today is a step back lunge. This exercise will be working your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. All you need is a smooth surface for lunging.To begin this exercise, start by standing tall with your feet placed about hip-width. Holding your chest up, and engaging your abdominals for added balance, step back with your right foot.Keeping the weight on the ball of your foot; proceed to sit into the extended leg by bending in that knee. Your front knee will be bending as well but be mindful to keep the positioning behind the front foot.Continue to bend and sit into this step back lunge as low as you are comfortable doing then proceed to push back up to your starting position. Stand tall, with both feet returned to level ground. Then repeat the same movement on the left side.Keeping your hands positioned just on your hips, shoot for at least eight to 10 lunges on each side for three sets each.If you need intensity, you can hold a set of hand weights in each hand. And if you need a little help with balance, you can hold a broomstick just in front of you.If you have issues with knee pain, you can keep the lunge shallow. Just be mindful to engage the muscles you are focusing on.This step back lunge is great added into any lower body routine, and is also a great move to help with balance and stability.Marlo Alleva, an instructor at Gold’s Gym and group fitness coordinator at Fontaine-Gills YMCA in Lakeland, Florida, can be reached at faluvzpa@msn.com.
