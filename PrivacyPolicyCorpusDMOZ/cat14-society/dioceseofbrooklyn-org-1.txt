We do not control these third-party websites and expressly disclaim any responsibility for the content, the accuracy of the information and any products or services available on the third-party websites.

Termination
The Organization may suspend or terminate your use of or access to the Website if you fail to comply with these Terms of Use. Such suspension or termination may result in the permanent deletion of your information or other previously available content.
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend (subject to the Organization’s right, in its sole discretion, to assume exclusive defense and control), and hold harmless the Organization, its partners, consultants, officers, directors, employees, contractors, and advisors from and against all claims, losses, liability, expenses, damages, judgments, awards, and costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees), related to or arising from (i) any breach of these Terms of Use, (ii) your use or misuse of any material or information posted, provided, transmitted, or otherwise made available by you or by the Organization, or (iii) your access or use of the Website.
The Organization reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter that is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting the Organization’s defense of such matter.
Disputes
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of this Website, or to any products or services sold or distributed through the Website, if any, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms of Use
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the Organization’s offices at 310 Prospect Park West, Brooklyn, NY 11215. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. You also agree that we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of our intellectual property rights.
