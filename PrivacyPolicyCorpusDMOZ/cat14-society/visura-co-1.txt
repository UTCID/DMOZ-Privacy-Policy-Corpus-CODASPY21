"BETA TESTING" not withstanding, all other accounts are required to pay upfront. Visura requires that you provide payment information when you first register.
The Hosting Services are intended to be used by Visura account holders with PRIME and GUILD accounts for limited distribution of photos, videos as well.

Upon such renewal, the credit card designated on your account will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee then in effect at the time of renewal. If you notify Visura (via the Settings accessible from your Visura profile page) that you wish to upgrade to a higher subscription level, then the credit card designated on your account will be billed for the difference in price, prorated for the remainder of your term.

You may request termination of a Subscription at any time by creating a Cancellation Request (Settings > Subscription), or by sending an email to support@Visura.co that provides clear written notice of such request, including the "account name" you provided to Visura at the time you ordered your Subscription. When Visura receives your termination request, Visura will terminate your Subscription if it has the necessary information to do so. Visura will notify you of termination via email. Visura may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription(s).

Upon termination, any User Content you have stored on the Platform may no longer be retrieved, so you should make a backup copy of any such User Content on a regular basis and before terminating your account.
You may change your email or the credit card information for your account by using the Subscription Page or by sending an email to info@visura.co that provides clear written notice of the requested change, including the "nickname" currently associated with your Visura Subscription. If the credit card designated on your account is invalid and cannot be billed for the renewal Subscription Fee, then Visura may terminate your account for nonpayment. If Visura does not have a current, working email address, then you may not receive important notices from us regarding your account, which may include notices regarding termination. If your account is terminated and Visura cannot reach you due to an invalid email address or for any other reason, then Visura will (subject to Section B.4) endeavor to retain your User Content on the Platform for at least 30 days after termination. However, Visura cannot guarantee that your User Content will remain on the Platform after termination or that you will receive notice of such termination, so you should make a backup copy of any such User Content on a regular basis.
