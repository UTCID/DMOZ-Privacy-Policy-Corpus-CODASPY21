a subscription, special publication or other service, you can
be assured that we do not rent or sell any of our mailing lists or
information
to anyone

information to correspond with you regarding your subscription
or to promote special offers and services. Any information

analysis and NOT for the purposes of identifying or tracking
an individual user.
