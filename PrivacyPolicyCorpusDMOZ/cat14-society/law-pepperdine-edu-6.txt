Web Accessibility
Pepperdine University affirms the dignity of every individual. Our commitment to an
inclusive community necessitates an accessible web enterprise and information technology,
designed to support individuals who experience physical or mental disabilities, including,
but not limited to, visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning,
and neurological impairments.
Pepperdine formally implements equal access to web content through University guidelines and policies informed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 developed by the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Level AA, which provides guidance in meeting web accessibility
requirements. Pepperdine maintains an active accessibility checklist in support of
specific techniques and testing methods that enables the entire University community,
including web designers, developers, and content creators, to meet these guidelines
when developing and publishing to any web platform.
The University encourages community members to report any accessibility issues using
