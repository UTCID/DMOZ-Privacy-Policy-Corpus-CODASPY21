Privacy Policy
Website Privacy Policy
Lifeboat servers may record the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address
of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your
operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the
Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our
site.
We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different
sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to
improve the site. We delete this information after one
month.
We do not connect this information to your name or identity.
Newsletter Privacy Policy
When you subscribe to Lifeboat News, we collect your email address and
the date that you subscribed. We will not share this email address with
any other company, especially advertisers.
Membership and Donation Privacy Policy
When you join or donate to Lifeboat, we collect your name and postal
address, and record the date that you joined. The amount and date of
donation for your initial membership donation, and any subsequent
donation, is recorded for our records. We respect anonymous donations.
You may submit voluntarily any other personal information we request,
including phone number and email address, which we store with your
membership records.
We do not retain credit card information but only use it to process your
present donation. Credit card numbers for monthly donors are kept in a
secure location and processed in a secure online batch once per month.
Compelled Disclosure
If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have
submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are
prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order
to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt
to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address,
or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. We will
independently object to overly broad requests for access to information
about users of our site. If you do not challenge the disclosure request,
we may be legally required to turn over your information.
Lifeboat Foundation is committed to protecting the
privacy of
visitors to our website, as well as our members and
activists.
In this policy “Lifeboat” refers to Lifeboat Foundation staff, board
members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers and consultants, all
of whom are bound by law or contract to keep information they receive as
part of their assistance to Lifeboat confidential.
As to all of the information described below, Lifeboat will not give,
sell, rent or exchange the information with anyone else except as
compelled by law (see the final
section).
