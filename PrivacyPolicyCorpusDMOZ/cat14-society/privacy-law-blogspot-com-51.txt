Dec.

should get to cast ballots before future changes to policies for privacy
and data-collection, following pressure
from regulators to improve transparency.

the practice, the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a post on
its website. If that threshold isn’t met, Facebook said it would be
non-binding.
