NewsHounds may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular content on NewsHounds.us. NewsHounds may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, NewsHounds does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
NewsHounds discloses personally-identifying or potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its contractors, volunteers, and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on NewsHounds’ behalf or to provide services available on the NewsHounds website(s) and who have agreed not to disclose it to others.

NewsHounds will not rent or sell personally-identifying or potentially personally-identifying information to anyone or to any organization. Other than to those contractors, volunteers, and affiliated organizations described above, NewsHounds discloses personally-identifying information or potentially personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when NewsHounds believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the safety, property or rights of NewsHounds, NewsHounds contractors, volunteers, third parties or the public at large.
