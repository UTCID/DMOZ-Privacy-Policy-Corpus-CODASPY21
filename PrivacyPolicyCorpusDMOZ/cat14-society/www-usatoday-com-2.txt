We are at the center of it all
USA TODAY NETWORK is the largest local-to-national digital media organization in the country. USA TODAY, our national flagship brand, sits at the center of the NETWORK, surrounded by hundreds of local media properties reporting on the stories and cultural moments happening across America and in our communities.
Voice of a nation
We work to be a center for balanced discourse. Our editorial is inclusive and represents the voice of an entire nation. Quick to read and useful, we’re not information overload; we’re a clear-cut guide to what’s most important.
Our NETWORK is our superpower
Unlike any other media organization, we combine the national exposure of USA TODAY with 300+ local digital properties across 46 states. Our 5,000 journalists live, work and thrive in these communities, providing coverage of the entire nation on the USA TODAY platform.
Together, our network news outlets have received 93 Pulitzers and have been recognized with numerous other state, regional, and national awards, including the Edward R. Murrow Award; Columbia Dupont; George Polk Awards; Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award; and the American Society of News Editors’ Batten Medal.
