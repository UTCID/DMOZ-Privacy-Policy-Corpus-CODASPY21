OurCampus’s outrageous Terms and Conditions.
January 23, 2020
From Jim Metrock:
I actually read this long document.  Principals won’t read this. They won’t think it’s worth their time. They care about their students but not enough to even skim this massive collection of words.
School board members won’t read it either. Teachers? No, they are too busy. Parents? No, they don’t even know this marketing firm is in their school.
I post this as we begin our coverage of OurCampus and Campus Advocate. Two new entities that have crawled out of the bomb crater that marked the death of Skoollive.  Alas, it seems the kiddie marketers at Skoollive will try once again to get their electronic billboards into schools.
OurCampus.app

In the event our Terms of use of the OurCampus iOS app are less restrictive than, or are otherwise in conflict with, Apple’s Usage Rules set forth for Licensed Applications in the App Store Terms of Service, then Apple’s Usage Rules (which you acknowledge you have reviewed) shall control.
In the event of any failure of the OurCampus iOS app to conform to any applicable warranty that has not been effectively disclaimed by these Terms, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the OurCampus iOS app (if any) to you; and that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the OurCampus iOS app, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty of OurCampus will be OurCampus’ responsibility, but only to the extent provided by these Terms.

Maintenance and Support. Except as set forth above and to the extent required by applicable law, OurCampus, and not Apple, is responsible for providing maintenance and support services with respect to the OurCampus iOS app.
Intellectual Property Rights.

14. TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS
In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or error in pricing or product information received from our suppliers, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders, even if the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged.

15. TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION

Any termination of the Terms shall not affect the respective rights and obligations (including without limitation, payment obligations) of the parties arising before the date of termination.
16. SEVERABILITY
The provisions of the Terms are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable. If any provision of the Terms is found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified or restricted to the extent, and in the manner, necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable. It is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that such modification or restriction may be accomplished unilaterally by us, or alternatively, by disposition of an arbitrator or a court of law. If such provision cannot under any circumstances be so modified or restricted, it shall be excised from the Terms without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions.
17. DISPUTES – AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CONTROVERSIES
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.
OurCampus and you agree that these Terms, and the use of the OurCampus.app and the OC Services, involve and affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 22.
In these Terms, the capitalized word “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Terms (including, for example, any dispute about the validity or enforceability of the Terms), the OC Services, the OurCampus.app, your use of any of the OC Services, OurCampus.app, Promotions, or to any products or services sold or distributed by OurCampus or otherwise through the OC Services or the OurCampus.app, your access or any other party’s access to and/or use of the OC Services and the OurCampus.app, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the OC Services and/or the OurCampus.app.
In the event of a Dispute, OurCampus or you must give the other party notice of the Dispute. This notice must include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the Dispute and the relief requested. You must send any such notice to OurCampus by email to info@ourcampus.app and by U.S. Mail to OurCampus, Attention: Legal, 600 W. Broadway, 12th Floor, San Diego, California 92101. If OurCampus has your contact information, we will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail to the address you have set in your account settings and to your email address.
You agree to try to resolve any Dispute with us through informal negotiations which are to begin within 30 days of the date that any notice of Dispute is sent by email and U.S. Mail to the other party. You and we agree to use reasonable, good faith efforts to settle any Dispute through consultation and negotiations. If after 30 days of such consultation and negotiation, we still cannot resolve the Dispute and if you or OurCampus do not want to continue reasonable, good faith efforts to settle the Dispute through consultation and negotiations, OurCampus or you may then resort to the other alternatives described in this section.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 17, Disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the OC Services or OurCampus.app shall not be subject to the notice, 30-day negotiation period, or arbitration as otherwise required by this Section 17.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Section 17, if a Dispute of any kind between you and OurCampus remains unresolved after 30 days of reasonable, good faith efforts to settle the Dispute through consultation and negotiations, the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration. This arbitration provision will also apply to any Dispute between you and any present or future parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of OurCampus, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of OurCampus.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Section 17, any Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court; provided, however, that:
if you have, in any manner, violated or threatened to violate OurCampus’ intellectual property rights, OurCampus may seek, and you shall not oppose, injunctive or other appropriate relief in any federal court located in San Diego County, California, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts;
if any court or arbitrator determines that the arbitration provisions provided in this Section 18 are void or unenforceable for any reason, then the applicable Dispute shall be litigated in federal court located in San Diego County, California, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts; and/or
OurCampus or you may assert claims in small claims court, if the applicable claims qualify and where jurisdiction and venue over you and OurCampus otherwise qualifies for such small claims court; provided, however, that if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree that you shall still provide OurCampus thirty 30 days’ prior written notice by email to info@ourcampus.app and by U.S. Mail to OurCampus.app, Attn: Legal, 600 W. Broadway, 12th Floor, San Diego, California 92101.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court in that there is no judge or jury in arbitration. Arbitration seeks to resolve disputes more quickly and court review of an arbitration award is limited. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow these Terms as a court would. OurCampus and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees. OurCampus and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision and other applicable Terms, OurCampus and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. OurCampus and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
The arbitrator’s award will be in writing, shall be binding, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and at a location, governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Diego County, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless OurCampus is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must contact OurCampus, in writing (the “Demand”), to inform us of your intent to arbitrate a dispute. This Demand must: briefly explain the dispute; list your name, your address, and, if applicable, the name of your representative; specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable; identify the requested location for the arbitration, if an in-person hearing is requested; and state your demands. At the time you send the Demand to OurCampus, you must also send the following to the AAA: (i) a copy of the Demand; (ii) a copy of these Terms; and (iii) the applicable filing fee. You may submit these materials to the AAA by mail, online, or in person at a AAA office. As of the date of these Terms, the AAA’s mailing address is (but it should be confirmed):
• American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services
402 W. Broadway, Ste. 400
San Diego, CA 92101
Phone: (619) 239-3051
If for any reason a Dispute between OurCampus and you is before a court (e.g., if the arbitration provisions are found unenforceable), OurCampus and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury. As more fully set forth above, we also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.
You may opt not to be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to OurCampus by email to info@ourcampus.app. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of any of the OC Services or the OurCampus.app after the posting of these Terms on October 1, 2019. If you do not opt out pursuant to this Section 17, you will be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 17. If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, OurCampus will not be bound by the terms of this Section 17 either with respect any Dispute it has with you.
18. CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 18 CLASS ACTION WAIVER CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
For purposes of this Section 18 Class Action Waiver, we will also use the capitalized word “Dispute” to mean any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Terms (including, for example, any dispute about the validity or enforceability of the Terms), the OC Services, OurCampus.app, any products or services sold or distributed by OurCampus or otherwise through the OC Services or the OurCampus.app, your access or any other party’s access to and/or use of the OC Services and the OurCampus.app, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the OC Services and/or the OurCampus.app.
OurCampus and you agree to resolve any Dispute will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. OurCampus and you further agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to any Dispute with a third party.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this Section 18 Class Action Waiver is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims, or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in San Diego County, California.
If any clause within this Section 18 Class Action Waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.
This Section 18 Class Action Waiver will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of OurCampus, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of OurCampus, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims is a Dispute.
19. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
The laws of the State of California apply to everything relating to your relationship and dealings with OurCampus. This means that the Terms, any and all disputes, claims and controversies arising out of or relating to the OC Services or the OurCampus.app shall be governed by and construed exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.
20. PRICING, TAXES, ORDER REQUIREMENTS, GIFT CARDS, AND PRODUCT PROMOTIONS
Pricing and Reported Savings
OurCampus continuously works to offer competitive prices on everything we carry. In certain instances, and for certain products, we also report suggested savings as a percentage. The percentage savings we report are based on a comparison of prices for bulk or wholesale sizes of products available on OurCampus.app against the prices for equivalent or similar bulk or wholesale sizes of products or retail sizes available on national e-commerce retail websites and mobile applications.
Taxes
Items sold on OurCampus.app or through the OC Services may be subject to tax, governmental charges, or deposit fees. In most cases, prior to submitting your purchase request, you will see an estimate of the taxes and other fees to be collected on your order. This amount will depend on various factors, including the items purchased, the shipment destination, and, in certain circumstances, the identity of the seller (if not OurCampus). In certain limited circumstances and for certain third-party sellers, the tax amount may be included in the price of a product.
Unless specifically indicated on a product’s description page or the checkout page, OurCampus is the seller of items purchased on OurCampus.app or through the OC Services. Any applicable tax on those items will be applied to the item price you pay for taxable items, less any savings amounts.
With respect to those products that are not sold by OurCampus, such products will be subject to tax based on the sales tax collection obligations of the applicable seller. Applicable tax on such orders will be applied to the item price indicated by the seller. For these items, savings amounts will not always reduce the price at which tax is charged.
Shipping
OurCampus only ships to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. We do not ship to Alaska, Hawaii or to United States territories and protectorates. Other than orders fulfilled by third parties, shipments are delivered by UPS®, FedEx®, or another private courier. Shipments of products marketed through the OC Services and/or OurCampus.app, but fulfilled by third parties, are each shipped separately from other OurCampus products sold through the OC Services or on OurCampus.app.
The exact delivery date of your order may depend on several factors, including, without limitation, the date and time you place your order, the schedules and processes of our shipping partners, holiday schedules, weather, and other factors. Even though we try to anticipate delays, we cannot predict or always prepare for delays caused by carriers, mistakes in delivery or shipment information, changes to orders, strikes, bad weather, or other similar circumstances. If there is a delay, we will do whatever we can to help move things along, although we cannot promise we’ll be able to resolve the delay. If you have questions about your delivery, please contact us at info@ourcampus.app.
Minimum Order Requirements and Free Shipping
We may, in our sole discretion, set and adjust minimum (or maximum) quantity and/or price requirements from time to time for any order or attempted order placed on OurCampus.app.
We may also, in our sole discretion, set and adjust minimum (or maximum) quantity and/or price requirements from time to time for any user to receive free shipping on any order placed on OurCampus.app.
Free Product Samples
OurCampus users may have access to free product samples, as offered from time-to-time by OurCampus, in its sole discretion. Product samples are subject to availability and may be replaced by OurCampus with substitutes of greater, equivalent, or lesser value to any sample advertised by OurCampus or selected by you. To receive free product samples, you must add the requested samples to your cart on OurCampus.app prior to checking out. If free product samples are not added to your cart before checkout, such samples will not be included in your order. Free product samples cannot be added to previously placed orders.
In certain circumstances, all of the products in your OurCampus order may be fulfilled solely by a third-party. In such circumstances, OurCampus shall be under no obligation to provide, ship, or replace any free product samples.
OurCampus may include a free product sample in your order that does not require your selection or addition to your cart. By using the OC Services and OurCampus.app, you agree to receive free product samples provided by OurCampus without any action by you, subject to availability and in OurCampus’ sole discretion. You understand that it is important to read the ingredients contained in free sample products, which may be made with known food allergens. We do not separate products based on their listed ingredients and the potential for any ingredient to be an allergen.
Promotional Codes
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, OurCampus may, in OurCampus’ sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for discounts, credit, or other features or benefits related to the OC Services, OurCampus.app, or third-party provider’s services, subject to terms that OurCampus establishes on a per promotional code basis (“Promo Codes”). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) shall only be used by the intended audience and for the intended purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public, unless expressly permitted by OurCampus; (iii) may be disabled by OurCampus at any time for any reason without liability to OurCampus and without notice; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that OurCampus establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. OurCampus reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that OurCampus determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.
Promotional Emails
As a user, you agree to receive newsletters and promotional emails, including, without limitation, certain third-party offers.
Promotional, gift, or offer codes and Gift Cards
From time-to-time, we may offer qualified consumers “promotional codes,” “gift codes,” or “offer codes” through a variety of promotional activities and communications (collectively referred to herein as “promotional codes”) that are redeemable towards a purchase on OurCampus.app or through the OC Services, while supplies last, and subject to certain merchandise exclusions or any other restrictions, as may be determined and communicated by us in our sole discretion. Only valid promotional codes provided or promoted by us will be honored at checkout. Other codes supplied or promoted by third parties unauthorized by us (including any unauthorized third-party websites) will not be considered valid. Unless otherwise stated in a particular promotional code’s terms and conditions, each promotional code is non-transferable and valid for single use (limit one per order) on an item (or items) of merchandise as determined by OurCampus. Promotional codes cannot be used towards purchase of non-branded merchandise, packaging or applicable taxes. Promotional codes must be entered in the “Apply Promo Code/Gift Card” field at checkout. Promotional codes are valid through the OurCampus.app only. We are not responsible for lost, stolen or corrupted promotional codes or any unauthorized use of promotional codes. Promotional codes cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent; no substitutions or credits allowed. The dollar value of any promotional code will not be refunded or credited back if any or all of the merchandise is returned. Expiry dates may apply to each promotional code. Promotional codes are void if copied, transferred, sold, exchanged or expired, and where prohibited. Requests not complying with all promotional code requirements will not be honored.
From time-to-time, in our sole discretion, we may offer Gift Cards and/or Gift Certificates (collectively referred to herein as “Gift Cards”) for purchase by our customers. Gift Cards are redeemable only on OurCampus.app and are subject to the terms and conditions in effect at the time of purchase.
Gift Cards have no expiration date, and you will not be subject to any dormancy fee, transaction fee, or other fees for use or non-use of a Gift Card. Gift Cards are not “credit cards” and cannot be used as such. Gift Cards are assigned a fixed monetary value in United States dollars and should be treated as cash. Use of a Gift Card is limited to the amount of funds held on the Gift Card and it is your responsibility to know the amount of available funds on your Gift Card at all times. From time to time, single-use Gift Cards with a fixed monetary value may be issued where the entire monetary value of the Gift Card must be applied in one transaction, with any remaining balance forfeited if the entire monetary value is not so applied. Gift Cards may be redeemed as payment for any of the products on the OurCampus.app. Gift Card balances may not be used to purchase additional or other Gift Cards and cannot be reloaded, resold or transferred for value. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.
Gift Cards are not returnable or refundable for cash except in states where required by law. For example, if a balance of less than $5 remains on a Gift Card owned by a New Jersey resident following redemption, upon such New Jersey resident’s request to info@ourcampus.app, we will refund the balance. Except to the extent required by applicable law, any unused Gift Card balance will remain in the recipient’s Gift Card account and such balances are not transferable or refundable. The full amount of each purchase, including taxes, shipping and other applicable charges, will be deducted from the funds held on the Gift Card, up to the total funds available on the Gift Card. If a purchase made with a Gift Card exceeds the amount of the Gift Card, the balance must be paid by another valid payment method (i.e., credit card, debit card, additional Gift Card(s)).
Gift Cards are subject to verification, and any Gift Card that we believe, in our sole discretion, to have been purchased or obtained fraudulently or through illegal means will be subject to invalidation without refund. Gift Cards may not be used in connection with any Promotion, Promo Code, promotional codes, marketing, advertising or other promotional activities without prior approval of OurCampus. Furthermore, the use of Gift Cards in any manner that suggests, states or implies that any person, website, business, product or service is endorsed or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, OurCampus is prohibited unless you receive prior written approval for such use from OurCampus.
OurCampus may provide Gift Card purchasers with information, or means to access information, about the redemption status of Gift Cards from time to time. To check your credit balance, visit OurCampus.com/account/invite. OurCampus reserves the right to change these terms and conditions from time to time in its discretion, subject to compliance with all applicable laws. The most current version of this Gift Card policy will be available on this site and will supersede all previous versions of this Gift Card policy. Your continued use of a Gift Card is your acceptance of all then-current terms and conditions. Gift Cards are void if not obtained in accordance with these terms and conditions and through legitimate channels.
OURCAMPUS MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CARDS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT A GIFT CARD IS NON-FUNCTIONAL (WHETHER DUE TO PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC ISSUES WITH SUCH GIFT CARD), YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH GIFT CARD, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE RISK OF LOSS AND TITLE FOR GIFT CARDS PASS TO THE PURCHASER UPON OUR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION TO THE RECIPIENT OR DELIVERY TO THE RECIPIENT AT THE ADDRESS PROVIDED BY RECIPIENT TO OURCAMPUS, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE. OURCAMPUS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY GIFT CARD THAT IS LOST, STOLEN, DESTROYED OR USED WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT WILL OURCAMPUS BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCOME, LOST PROFITS, EXEMPLARY, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PERSON’S USE, OR OURCAMPUS’S PROVISION, OF ANY GIFT CARD.
For any questions concerning your Gift Card(s), please contact info@ourcampus.app. Use of this Gift Card for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited.
Third Party Sites & Ads
The OC Services and OurCampus.app may contain links to third-party websites, services, and advertisements for third parties (collectively, “Third Party Sites & Ads”). Such Third-Party Sites & Ads are not under the control of OurCampus and OurCampus is not responsible for such Third-Party Sites & Ads. OurCampus does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to the Third-Party Sites & Ads. You use all Third-Party Sites & Ads at your own risk. When you link to a Third-Party Site & Ad, the applicable third party’s terms and conditions apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction on or with such Third-Party Sites & Ads.
Third Party Services
When you use the OC Services or OurCampus.app, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties, such as a wireless carrier or a mobile platform provider. Your use of these third-party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties.
22. RETURN POLICY
All return requests must be made within fourteen (14) days of delivery, as reported by the respective third-party package delivery company, to qualify for return. Return requests received more than fourteen (14) days after the date of delivery are not eligible for return.
All purchases made with a Promo Code or pursuant to a Promotion are final and are not eligible for return, unless the reason for the return request is for errors or inaccuracies in the order made by OurCampus.
Users may not return items for reason of stock or inventory balancing, offsetting unused inventory, insufficient expiry period, inability to resell items, quantity miscalculation, or reversing initial acceptance of purchased orders. All specialized or custom purchases, including, without limitation, phone orders, orders made pursuant to purchase order, business orders, discounted orders, and custom pallet orders requiring special delivery accommodations by OurCampus, are not eligible for return, unless otherwise agreed in writing by OurCampus, in its sole discretion.
If the Return Policy allows for a return, or we otherwise agree to a return in writing, we do not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. We will only issue a refund upon receiving the returned item at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, we do not take title to the refunded item.
23. PRODUCT PICK-UP
OurCampus may provide you access to certain physical locations from time to time, in the exercise of its sole discretion, for the in-person pick-up of products purchased through use of the OurCampus.app and the OC Services. You agree that by entering such premises, you agree to comply with all posted rules and regulations, and all applicable law, pertaining to your presence on, and use of, such premises. OurCampus or a third-party designated by OurCampus may communicate additional rules to you from time to time and your continued presence on the premises will be deemed to indicate your acceptance of such rules. You acknowledge and agree that you shall remain solely liable for all of your actions and omissions taken while present on such premises, and the actions and omissions of any minors accompanying you to the premises.
24. SUBSCRIPTIONS
We understand life is hectic! You can schedule regular deliveries of your favorite items with OurCampus’ subscription service. By placing an order through our subscription service, you agree to these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements applicable to OurCampus’ subscription service. Without limiting the effect of Section 17, OurCampus reserves the right to change the subscription service benefits, including any discounts and eligibility used to determine discount amounts, at any time and at our sole discretion. All changes will apply to future orders, including those for current subscriptions.
To subscribe to an eligible product, simply follow the subscription instructions on your account home page, or the product page for the item or items you would like to subscribe to. It’s as simple as that! We will send you a reminder email before each delivery showing you the product(s) and any applicable discount for your upcoming delivery. The prices on your items may change, depending on the price for the selected product(s) at the time your order is processed and shipped.
If you have any questions regarding your subscription, or need additional help, you can contact us atinfo@ourcampus.app.
Enrollment, Monthly Fee and Benefit Rollover
You may enroll in a subscription through your personal account page on OurCampus.app, or through other means that we may make available to you from time to time. Enrollment will be for successive periods of one month, unless a different period is specified at the time, and through the means, of enrollment. Your enrollment will automatically renew each month unless and until you cancel your enrollment by following the steps described in the “Subscription Changes and Cancellation” paragraph below. You will be charged a fee for your subscription enrollment on or about the date of enrollment, subject to any trial periods that may be offered by OurCampus from time to time at our sole discretion, and a monthly fee thereafter. The monthly fee for the subscription will be based on the subscription tier you select and will be stated on your account page or through any other means provided for enrollment in the subscription plan program. From time to time, we may offer different benefit and payment options under the subscription plan program, and the fees for such options may vary depending on the option chosen.
Any subscription benefits accrued to your account, but that are unused in any month of paid enrollment in a subscription plan, may rollover for use in succeeding months of your active enrollment in the subscription. Similarly, accrued, but unused, benefits from a higher tier subscription plan will rollover for use in succeeding months of your active enrollment after a change to your subscription plan, including a change to a lower tier subscription plan. OurCampus reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether any accrued, but unused, benefits will be able to be used after the cancellation of your enrollment in an OurCampus subscription plan.
Enrollment in a subscription may require you to have a valid telephone number and a valid credit or debit card on file that will be used to process your monthly fee, and which will be stored to process the monthly fee until you are no longer enrolled in the subscription plan program. Gift Cards, coupons, Promo Codes, and other discounts or Promotions are not eligible to be applied to the cost of your subscription plan. Taxes may apply on either or both of the subscription monthly fee and the benefits provided through the plan you choose (such as reduced and/or free shipping charges).
By providing your phone number, you agree that we may call you from time to time on the number provided in connection with the management of your account, including to discuss any issues with the payment method provided. By providing your credit or debit card, you authorize OurCampus or its agents to charge the provided card for each month of enrollment, unless you change or cancel your enrollment by following the steps described in the “Subscription Changes and Cancellation” paragraph below.
If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription monthly fee (whether for your initial enrollment or any subsequent renewal), you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your enrollment may be immediately suspended or cancelled. If you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new enrollment period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. If you do not provide us with a new eligible payment method or are not otherwise successfully charged, we reserve the right to apply any Promotion balances accrued in your account for application to any subscription plan benefits conferred to you, but not paid for.
Subscription Changes and Cancellation
Unless you received a gift through participation in the FundFest program at the time of commencement of your subscription plan, you may change your selected subscription plan tier at any time by visiting your account page and adjusting your subscription enrollment; provided that we may charge you (or withhold from any eligible refund amount) the value of all subscription benefits used by you prior to the effective date of your change or cancellation. You may also cancel your subscription enrollment prior to the monthly renewal date by either visiting your OurCampus account page and following the cancellation instructions, or, if unavailable, by sending an email to customer service at info@ourcampus.app. You will continue to enjoy your subscription plan benefits until the cancellation effective date; provided that the subscription plan benefits that may have accrued prior to the cancellation effective date, but that will be delivered or provided after the cancellation effective date may be forfeited in the event of your cancellation. You will not be charged for the following month if you cancel your subscription plan enrollment at least five (5) days prior to the start of that month. If you cancel at any other time, you will not be eligible for any refunds of your subscription plan monthly fee, but OurCampus may issue a refund for your monthly fee in the exercise of its sole discretion. Refunds will be processed in a timely manner, but please allow sufficient processing times, which may vary based on the procedures and policies of your card issuer and/or financial institution.
If you received a gift through your participation in the FundFest program at the time of commencement of your subscription plan, you may still cancel or modify your subscription plan as provided in the preceding paragraph. But, if you do so before the expiration of the number of minimal required months of the subscription plan, you may (at OurCampus’ sole discretion) be required to (1) pay the remaining balance of the subscription plan owed for the minimum subscription plan time, or (2) pay for the value of the FundFest gift. The minimum number of required months of the subscription plan and/or the value of the FundFest gift will be provided to you at the time of the presentation of the FundFest prize.
UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR BOXED PASS ENROLLMENT, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR OURCAMPUS SUBSCRIPTION PLAN ENROLLMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW ON THE ONE- MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF YOUR ENROLLMENT IN A SUBSCRIPTION PLAN TIER AND FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE-MONTH PERIODS THEREAFTER AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MONTHLY FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.
Eligible Products & Offer Details
You can subscribe to eligible products that provide a subscription offer on OurCampus.app. By subscribing to OurCampus’ subscription service, OurCampus will automatically create a new order according to your chosen delivery schedule and will charge one or more of your payment methods on file, until you modify your subscription, modify your payment methods, or cancel your subscription. The details of a subscription offer may change as you receive deliveries over time. These changes can include item price, minimum order amounts, and shipping charges.
Your OurCampus subscriptions are unique to you, and you may not assign or transfer any subscription or any of the benefits to a third party without our authorization. OurCampus’ subscriptions are void where prohibited by law.
Discounts & Product Promotions
OurCampus may offer subscription discounts and other limited-time promotions on one or more eligible subscription products. If there is a discount applicable to an item, the discount for that item will appear on the product page, and then may only apply if you select the subscription delivery method. OurCampus may change any discount at any time. Limited-time promotions apply only during their effective dates.
If an item ships before the subscription discount changes, you will receive the old discount on that order; however, the new discount, if any, will apply to future orders. The item price and any applicable discounts will be calculated before your reminder email. The price of the item may decrease or increase between deliveries but will never be higher than the price shown in your reminder email.
Payment
When your order is processed, OurCampus will charge you the cost of the item on that day, less any applicable subscription discount, plus any applicable sales taxes and other governmental charges and fees. We’ll apply any eligible promotional credit balances on your OurCampus customer account toward the balance of your order before charging any remaining balance to your payment method on file.
We will bill your subscription to the payment method used to create your subscription or as otherwise directed by you. If we cannot complete your order with the payment method you used to create your subscription, you authorize us to update your subscription with an alternative payment method in your account and to charge your subscription on that payment method
Returns
All returns under OurCampus’ subscription service are subject to OurCampus’ return policy.
25. ORDERS FULFILLED BY PARTNERS
Certain products and services marketed on OurCampus.app are stored, shipped, and fulfilled by third- party manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, and/or other independent parties. OurCampus will endeavor to identify such relationships on the applicable product pages and/or in the product description, but makes no guarantee, representation, or warranty that all or any products fulfilled by third parties will be so identified. In instances where products fulfilled by third parties are displayed on OurCampus.app, OurCampus is acting solely in its capacity as marketer to such third parties with respect to the products and services fulfilled by such third parties.
Once you have placed an order through the OurCampus.app for products and services that are fulfilled by parties other than OurCampus, we will send you an order acknowledgement by email setting out what you have ordered. This is not an order confirmation or acceptance from OurCampus or the applicable third parties that will be responsible for fulfilling third-party goods and services market on the OurCampus.app, which order confirmation may be issued directly by such third-parties or OurCampus on such third parties’ behalf.
Certain products and services fulfilled by third-parties may require additional time for delivery, may involve surcharges for shipping, handling, and/or delivery, may require age verification upon delivery, or may have additional requirements imposed by the third party fulfilling the order for these products and services in order to process orders and completed delivery. OurCampus will endeavor to describe all requirements applicable to such third-party products and services, but makes no guarantee, representation, or warranty that all or any requirements applicable to such third-party products and products will be identified, or, if identified, that such identified requirements will be accurate or complete.
Scheduled Delivery Services
Some products and services fulfilled by third parties require scheduled delivery due to their size and weight, the nature of the products and services, or the value of the products and services. These items may include, without limitation, large electronics, furniture, fitness and sporting equipment, jewelry, flowers and plants, recreation vehicles, appliances, yard fixtures, and other bulky items. If scheduled delivery is required, confirm in advance that an adult, age 18 or over (19 or over in AL or NE), with valid government-issued photo identification is available throughout the period of the scheduled delivery. Additional delivery requirements may be required to successfully complete delivery, some items may be delivered separately from other items in your order, and delivery to particular areas of your home may not be available. Failure to meet any minimum delivery and acceptance requirements communicated to you may result in additional shipping, handling, and/or delivery charges.
Delivery with Installation; Haul-Away and Recycling
If delivery with installation is available and selected by you during checkout, OurCampus or the third- party fulfilling the purchased products and services will deliver and install your purchase, subject to the agreed terms available at the time of purchase. Installation is not available for all products and may require additional fees along with the purchase of specific accessories or parts needed to make these connections. The third-party provider may make available recycling and haul-away services, which services may be subject to additional charges and fees as determined by the third-party fulfilling the new products purchased. If recycling or haul away services are not available, your new product you will need to have all old products disconnected and removed prior to the arrival of the delivery and installation personnel.
Customer Service; Return Policy for Third-Party Goods and Services
The third parties shipping, fulfilling, and delivering products and services marketed on the OurCampus.app may be in the best position to assist you with the portions of your order(s) comprised of goods and services not fulfilled by OurCampus. Contact the appropriate third party directly to resolve the problem. In most cases, OurCampus cannot track orders or process cancellations, returns or replacements for items that were purchased from a third party through use of OurCampus.app or OC Services, and these items cannot be returned to OurCampus. We will coordinate with these third parties to assist you with any questions or issues, but such parties may have customer service policies and procedures that vary from these Terms and will control the products and services they fulfill and deliver. In addition, such products and services may be subject to return policies specific to the third- party products and services offered, which OurCampus will endeavor to identify on the relevant product pages and/or in the relevant product description.
26. OUT OF STOCKS
If a product you have selected is not in stock, we reserve the right to, at our discretion, replace the product with an equivalent or similar product, provide you with a credit to your account for the amount paid for such item, or refund you for the item. “Equivalent” or “similar” items may be the same brand but a different type, size or flavor, or may be the same type of product but a different brand, size or flavor. Price adjustments for alternate products will not be requested by us nor extended to you in the event of a product substitution.
27. FUNDFEST PROGRAM
With enrollment in a subscription plan, you will be eligible to participate in OurCampus’ FundFest Promotion Program. From time-to-time, we may make certain offers of gifts or awards which can be earned by you through the promotion of OurCampus subscription plans (each a “Promotion” and, collectively, the “Promotions”). Promotions may be publicized on the OurCampus.app, through advertisements, and/or through other marketing channels. If you participate in any Promotion, you will be subject to these Terms and any additional specific terms, conditions, rules, and policies applicable to the Promotion.
Unless otherwise disclosed in any applicable Promotion-specific terms, conditions, rules, or policies, Promotions are not combinable with other Promotions, have expiration dates, are subject to certain caps and limitations, are non-transferable, can only be used once per household, can only be redeemed through the OurCampus.app and may be suspended or terminated at any time by OurCampus at OurCampus’ sole discretion. OurCampus determines, in its sole discretion, the accrual rates, thresholds, method and timing for the application or implementation of any Promotion and/or any other restrictions as may be determined and communicated by OurCampus in its sole discretion.
As to the Promotions, the following shall apply: (i) they shall only be used by the intended audience and for the intended purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) subscription plan credits earned by you may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public, unless expressly permitted by OurCampus; (iii) Promotions may be disabled by OurCampus at any time for any reason without liability to OurCampus and without notice; (iv) Promotions may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that OurCampus establishes for such Promotions; (v) awards and gifts are not valid for cash; and (vi) awards/gifts may expire prior to your use. OurCampus reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promotions by you or any other user in the event that OurCampus determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.
The gifts or award to be earned may vary from Promotion to Promotion. Any tax imposed on any Promotion gift or award shall by paid by you.
