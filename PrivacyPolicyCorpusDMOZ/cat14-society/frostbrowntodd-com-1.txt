Privacy & Data Security
Helping clients comply as they innovate.
Our team of business, intellectual property and litigation attorneys advises on all aspects of privacy compliance, information handling, data security, breach preparation and response, enforcement and other related litigation. We guide clients in taking concrete and practical steps to meet their legal obligations and mitigate operational and reputational risks.
Several of our privacy professionals have achieved their International Association of Privacy Professionals privacy credential. Our ranks also include former technology professionals, engineers, and software developers. While each attorney on our team brings a distinct skillset, the one common denominator is that we are fluent in the technology and sophisticated data management systems used by businesses competing in today’s economy.
We recognize that an effective compliance program must be tailored to each client’s operations, data practices, and risk profile. We draw upon our collective experience and deep regulatory knowledge to help clients in virtually every industry enhance their cybersecurity architecture and navigate their legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S., Europe, and globally.

Before you send us any information, know that contacting us does not create an attorney-client relationship. We cannot represent you until we know that doing so will not create a conflict of interest with any existing clients. Therefore, please do not send us any information about any legal matter that involves you unless and until you receive a letter from us in which we agree to represent you (an "engagement letter"). Only after you receive an engagement letter will you be our client and be properly able to exchange information with us. If you understand and agree with the foregoing and you are not our client and will not divulge confidential information to us, you may contact us for general information.
