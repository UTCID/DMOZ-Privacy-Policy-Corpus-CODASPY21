Policy and procedures
Policy and procedures
We’re a charity that takes our responsibilities and obligations seriously.
We’re committed to transparency.
We are guided by our vision, mission and values.
We try not to be too “policy” heavy and take a positive proactive approach to how we can achieve impactful change, but there are a few things which need a clear policy approach to guide us in how we act and behave.
Foremost in these is the protection of the children we are here to support, and their families.
Our child safeguarding policy and wish family privacy policy.
We’re also committed to responsible fundraising (FR promise) and looking after our supporters (Privacy policy). This section shares some of our key policies with you.
If you have any questions about our approach, please do just get in touch.
We’re happy to answer your questions.
