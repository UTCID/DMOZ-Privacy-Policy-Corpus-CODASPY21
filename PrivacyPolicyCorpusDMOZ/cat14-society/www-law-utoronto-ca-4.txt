Food Law and Policy Society
The Food Law and Policy Society (FLPS) is a student club dedicated to exploring issues in the regulation of Canadian and global food systems. We are interested in a variety of topics such as labelling and advertising, the regulation of animal agriculture, the management of supply chains, intellectual property, and corporate competition. We host social and educational events to connect with professionals in food law and learn about relevant court decisions, policies and regulations, and opportunities in the field. ContactTo receive updates on events and opportunities, please follow our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/University-of-Toronto-Food-Law-Policy-Society-534053420310398. For more information, contact the FLPS executive team at utfoodlaw@gmail.com.
