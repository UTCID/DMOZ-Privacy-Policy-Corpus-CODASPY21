If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms of Use on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Materials or Sites after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Sites or Materials. It is your responsibility to regularly check to determine if there have been changes to these Terms and to review such changes.

The Materials or Sites may be linked to other sites not maintained by CARE. CARE is not responsible for the content of those sites. The inclusion of any link to such sites does not imply endorsement by CARE of the sites. CARE makes no representations whatsoever about any other sites which you may access through CARE.
These limitations apply even if there is negligence on the part of CARE Entities or an authorized CARE representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages, or both.
Purchases. Any purchases through the Materials or on the Sites are through third-party providers and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth on such corresponding sites. Any dispute must be resolved directly with the third party provider.
CARE Programs. The Materials may contain references to CARE services, products and programs that are international and may or may not exist in your country. These references do not imply that CARE intends to announce or provide the programs in your country. All questions about CARE activities in your country should be directed to the appropriate CARE Country Office.
Monitoring. You understand and agree that CARE may, but is not obligated to, review the Materials and may delete or remove (without notice) any Content or Submissions in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, including Submissions that in the sole judgment of CARE violate this Agreement, or that might be offensive, illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of Users or others. You are solely responsible at your sole cost and expense for creating backup copies and replacing any Submissions you post or store in the Materials, on the Sites or provide to CARE.

CARE may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Materials (including on the Sites) and/or terminate access of any Users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

Share Services
CARE offers a feature whereby Users of the Materials can share with others or post to their own member profile, videos, articles and other Third Party Applications, Software or Content from, and/or links to, Third Party Sites (the “Share Service”). You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Share Services and all links, User Content or Third Party Applications, Software or Content shared through the Share Service is subject to, and will fully comply with the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms.
Subject to these Terms, Third Party Sites that meet the requirements set forth herein may place a Share Link (as described below), in the form approved by CARE and with the written consent of CARE, on pages of their Web sites to facilitate use of the Share Service. A Third Party Site that posts a Share Link on its Web site(s) (each an “Online Content Provider”) shall abide and be subject to the applicable sections of these Terms. A “Share Link” is a button and/or a text link appearing on an Online Content Provider’s web page that, upon being clicked by a User, enables us to launch a sharing mechanism through which Users can share with others or post to their own member profile, links and content from that page.
If the Share Link is a button that contains any icons or other graphic images, trademarks or other proprietary materials of CARE, Online Content Provider is granted permission to use such images, trademarks or other materials solely for the purpose of placing the Share Link on Online Content Provider’s site and solely in the current form provided by CARE. The rights granted in this paragraph may be revoked by CARE at any time with or without cause in its sole discretion, and upon such termination, Online Content Provider agrees to immediately remove all Share Links from its site.  No such link shall be deemed to be an endorsement of the material, products, services, or content of the third party Provider.
In order for an Online Content Provider to include a Share Link on its pages, the Third Party Site must not contain any web content that if shared or posted by a User would be a violation of these Terms. Without limiting the forgoing, Online Content Provider agrees not to post a Share Link on any Web site(s) that contains, and represents and warrants that such Web site(s) does not and will not contain, any content that is infringing, harmful, threatening, unlawful, defamatory, abusive, inflammatory, harassing, vulgar, obscene, lewd, fraudulent, or invasive of privacy or publicity rights or that may expose CARE or its Users to any harm or liability of any type. Upon including of a Share Link, Online Content Provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold CARE, CARE International, their affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising out of or in connection with such Share Link, any links, content or other items or materials which may be shared or posted through such Share Link, or any breach or alleged breach of the foregoing representations and warranties.
By including a Share Link, Online Content Provider automatically grants, and represents and warrants that it has the right to grant, to CARE an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use the Share Service in order to link to, use, copy, publish, stream, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), summarize, and distribute the content, links and other materials of any kind residing on any web pages on which Online Content Provider places the Share Link.
To report any violation of this Terms of Use, including without limitation, content that may be libelous, defamatory, unlawful, and/or infringing upon or violating any third-party right, as well as to request a copy of the information disclosure provided by CARE pursuant to California law, please contact legal@care.org.
Miscellaneous
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to this subject matter, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws roles. If any part of these Terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. “Includes”, “including” and other similar terms are deemed to include “without limitation” immediately thereafter, and any specification of the Site as part of the Materials is purely to provide clear meaning and does not imply that other references to Materials exclude the Sites.
You and CARE agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims relating in any way to or arising out of these terms of use, the materials (including your visit to or use of the materials) shall be final and binding arbitration, except that: (a) to the extent that either of us has in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret rights, or you have otherwise violated any of the User conduct roles set forth above then the parties acknowledge that arbitration is not an adequate remedy at law and that injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought; and (b) disputes or claims relating to any purchases from a third party or third party sites may be subject to other roles. Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Roles. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration or claim under these terms of use shall be joined to any other arbitration or claim involving any other current or former user of the service, and no class arbitration proceedings shall be permitted.  In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Materials (including your visit to or use of the Materials) be instituted more than three (3) years after the cause of action arose.
These Terms are also for the benefit of CARE Entities, each of which may assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.
