WEBSITE SECURITY & PRIVACY POLICY
Introduction
Protecting the privacy and personal information of our customers is of paramount importance and as such, we are committed to ensuring that there is no misuse of any personal or other data which may be collected from you.

The personal information we collect may include your name, email address, mailing or business address, phone numbers, credit card and other banking information but may include other information when needed to fulfill your requests and queries and as may be required by law.

We use the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL) 128 bit encryption. The URL in your browser will change to “HTTPS” instead of “HTTP” when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place.

seek to rapidly identify and secure the breach to prevent any further breaches;

if appropriate, place a notice on our website advising our customers of the breach.
