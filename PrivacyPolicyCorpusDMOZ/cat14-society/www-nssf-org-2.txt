C. Information We Collect from Others
We may receive additional information such as demographic and statistical information from third parties, such as business partners, marketers, researchers, analysts, and other parties that we may attribute to you based on your assignment to certain statistical groups.

Aggregate/Anonymous Data. We may aggregate and/or anonymize any information or data collected through the Services so that such information or data can no longer be linked to you or your device. We may use such information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third-parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors.

Where use of your personal information or personal data is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you
Where use of your personal information or personal data is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our Website and applications; operate our business and our Services; make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud, and to know the customer to whom we are providing Services)
Where we have a reason to process the data in accordance with applicable laws
Where we have your consent to engage in a particular processing activity
To fulfill our legal obligations
COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
To collect the information or data in the “Information We Automatically Collect” Section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences.  Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enable us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.
As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.
ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING
A. Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and others) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.  If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
For more information about Google Analytic cookies, please see Google’s help pages and privacy policy:
Google’s Privacy Policy
Google Analytics Help pages
For more information about Facebook Pixel, please see the link below:
About Facebook Pixel
B. Online Advertising
In using the Services, a third-party may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you. These third-parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google, Act-On Software, Facebook, Twitter and others) may use this information to serve relevant content and advertising to you as you use the Internet, and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third-parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Please note that if you exercise the choices above, you may still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.
C. Notice Concerning Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Website or via the Services for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.
HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
NSSF will share your information in the following ways:
Affiliates and Subsidiaries. We may share information we collect within NSSF to deliver products and services to you, provide email communications to you from NSSF and its affiliates and subsidiaries, ensure a consistent level of service, and enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.
Service Providers. We provide access to or share your information with select third- parties who perform services on our behalf. They have access to perform these services but are prohibited from using your information for other purposes. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, product content and features, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, show management, and legal services.
Protection of NSSF and Others. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain, and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of NSSF, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions, including in contemplation of such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such a transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.
Aggregate/Anonymous Information. From time to time, we may share Aggregate/Anonymous Information about use of the Services, such as by publishing a report on usage trends. The sharing of such data is unrestricted.
RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We keep your personal information and personal data no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and as set forth in our internal retention policies.
DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND YOUR CHOICES
You may have certain rights with respect to your personal information and personal data.
A. Your Legal Rights
If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Information” Section below at any time. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) provides data subjects (as defined in the GDPR) with the right to request that we:
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal data we hold about you
Prevent the processing of your personal data for direct-marketing purposes
Update personal data which is out of date or incorrect
Delete certain personal data we are using, processing, or storing
Object to the processing of your personal data if such processing is based on legitimate interests
Transfer your personal data to a third-party provider of services
Withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data
We will consider and address all requests to the extent required by the laws applicable to you and applicable to NSSF and will provide our response within the time period stated by any such applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests, to comply with a legal obligation, or to fulfill a contract. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.
In some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. We ask that you please attempt to resolve issues with us first, although you have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority at any time.
B. Marketing Communications
You may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.
C. We May Continue to Process Personal Information or Personal Data
Please be aware that, even if you are eligible to and exercise any of the rights set forth in this Section 8, NSSF may continue to process your personal information or personal data to pursue legitimate interests, to fulfill our contractual duties to you, or to comply with applicable law or legal obligations.
THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND FEATURES
The Services contain links to third-party websites, social media websites, and third-party plug-ins (such as the Facebook “like” button and Twitter “follow” button). We have no influence or control over linked third-party websites and your use of other sites is at your own risk and is subject to their privacy statements and policies. If you choose to use these websites or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. We are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information or personal data will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 16
The Services are intended for general audiences and not for children under the age of 16. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information or personal data from children under the age of 16 without valid consent under applicable law, we will permanently delete the personal information or personal data.  Please be advised that we do not request personal information or personal data from children under the age of 16, do not collect such information, and do not provide such information to third parties.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information, which are appropriate for the individual categories of information collected, used and stored. Our technical and organizational security measures are reviewed and revised from time to time to address technological advancements and developments.  NSSF cannot guarantee that your use of the Services will be error-free.  Your use of the Services does, in part, depend upon security measures that are not under our control, e.g., security measures you control related to your device, computer, network, or Internet browser.  Please keep this in mind when providing information through the Services.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of “personal information” (as defined by applicable California law) with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes. NSSF does not share your personal information with third-parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time.  For example, we may amend this Privacy Policy to reflect the requirements of applicable law, to conform with our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or shifts in technology. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the Privacy Policy periodically. Our Privacy Policy is always available on our Website. You will know if the Privacy Policy has changed since the last time you reviewed it by checking the “Effective Date” included at the beginning of Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to the Policy, we will comply with notice requirements set forth in applicable law, and it will be readily accessible and reviewable within the most current version of the Privacy Policy located on the Website. By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Privacy Policy.
CONTACT INFORMATION
Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about NSSF’s Privacy Policy or our information practices. You can reach us via email,  berwin@nssf.org or by mail at Attn: Benjamin Erwin, 11 Mile Hill Road, Newtown, CT 06470
