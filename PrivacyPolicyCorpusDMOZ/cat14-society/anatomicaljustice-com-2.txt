Privacy & Terms
Privacy Policy
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy.  That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy lets you know how and for what purposes your personal information is being collected, processed and used.  We pledge that we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information will only be used in ways that are in compliance with this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is only in effect for any web pages, e-mail lists, collective non-user-specific information and collective personal information collected on or through Anatomical Justice’s website, located at www.anatomicaljustice.com, as well as any online features, services and/or programs offered by Anatomical Justice (collectively, the “Website”).
Use of Information
Information collected by Anatomical Justice LLC (“Anatomical Justice”) is used for four main purposes.  First, we collect information to improve the Website by determining which of our areas, features and forums are most popular.  Second, we collect information to personalize the experience of the users of the Website.  For example, users of some of the features of the Website are required to create a User Account, UserID and password in order to access those features.  Third, we collect information to enable our users to participate in features, services, programs and/or other activities from time to time.  Finally, we collect information (such as credit card information) to enable our users to purchase our products directly through the Website.
In addition to the other times or occasions on which we might disclose information about users of the Website, we might also disclose information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to:  (a) comply with a legal process; (b) enforce this Privacy Policy; (c) respond to claims that any materials, documents, images, graphics, logos, designs, audio, video and any other information provided from or on the Website violates the rights of third parties; and/or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Anatomical Justice, its users or the public.
We use reasonable precautions to keep the information that is disclosed to us secure.  We reserve the right to transfer information in connection with the sale or other disposition of all or part of the Anatomical Justice business and/or assets.  Furthermore, we cannot and will not be responsible for any breach of security by any third parties or for any actions of any third parties that receive any of the information that is disclosed to us.  The Website may also link to a variety of other Websites and the Website may contain advertisements of third parties.  We are not and cannot be responsible for the privacy policies of those websites of third parties or how they treat information about their users.
In order to participate in many features, services and/or programs of the Website, we may require that you provide us with certain specific information, such as your full name, company information, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, personal interests and/or other information specific to you.  If you want to purchase products directly through the Website, we will also require that you provide us with credit card information, your customer number (if you have one) and related information.  You can choose whether or not to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to provide any required information, your experience on the Website may be diminished and some features may not be available or may not work as intended. If you choose not to provide the required credit card information, you will not be able to purchase products through the Website.
Credit Card Information
The online store at the Website is designed to protect the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us.  Anatomical Justice is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site.  We offer the industry standard security measures available by utilizing a Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) connection.  If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a sales representative over the telephone.  Simply call (610) 365-8393.  It is our practice to contact customers if a problem should arise with your purchase or if we need to send you a normal business communication regarding your purchase.
Information From Children
The Website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of thirteen (13).  We do not collect personally identifiable data from any person that we know to be under the age of thirteen (13).
Parents should be aware that Anatomical Justice’s Privacy Policy will govern our use of personal data, but also that information that is voluntarily given by children – or others – in chat sessions, e-mail exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by otherparties to generate unsolicited communications.  Anatomical Justice encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.
European Union Users
Because Anatomical Justice’s Website is accessible globally, the information that we collect may be made available to our affiliates, partners and subsidiaries worldwide.  For those users visiting us from the European Union, please note that Anatomical Justice may transfer your personally identifiable data outside the European Union for use for any of the purposes described above.  By using the Website and providing Anatomical Justice with your personal data, you consent to such transfer of your personal data.
How Information is Collected
IP Address
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer’s “Internet Protocol”, or IP, address.  When a user requests a web page from the Website, our web servers automatically recognize that user’s domain name and IP address.  The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about the user other than the IP address from which the user has accessed the Website.  We may use this information to examine our traffic in the aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals.  Our web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of users.
Cookies
From time to time, we and/or our affiliates or advertisers may send a “cookie” to your computer.  A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  A cookie, by itself, cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Websites.  A cookie, by itself, does not damage your system.  We may use cookies to identify and keep track of those areas of the Website that you have visited in the past in order to enhance your next visit to the Website.  Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times that you have seen an advertisement.  We and our advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you see on the Website.  You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser.  If you choose not to accept cookies, your experience on the Website may be diminished and some features may not be available or may not work as intended.
Value Added Benefits
We may request that you provide us with the personal information identified in the “Use of Information” Section of this Privacy Policy for the purposes identified in that Section.  Whenever we request personal information from a user of the Website, we will make an effort to indicate the purpose of the inquiry at the time the information is requested.  In order to provide users of the Website with many of the added values and special offers of reputable organizations and retailers, we may provide some or all of your personal information to reputable third-party companies.  Additionally, we may from time to time send e-mail to you announcing new features, services and/or programs offered through the Website.  You may also receive mailings, telephone calls and/or facsimiles from other reputable, third-party companies.  Users have the option of not participating in these value added benefits by following the procedure for withholding your personal information that is set forth at the end of this Privacy Policy.
When you create a User Account, UserID and password on the Website, and when you participate in any of the features, services and/or programs offered through the Website, we may request your full name, company information, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, personal interests and/or other relevant information specific to you.  If you choose to purchase products directly through the Website, you will also be required to provide us with credit card information, your customer number (if you have one) and related information.  This information will allow us to create your User Account and provide you with information that we believe will be important and relevant to you.  This information may also be used by us to notify you of features, services and/or programs that may be of interest to you.
The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Anatomical Justice.  Whenever we collect personal information about you, we will make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
Member Account, Password And Security
For certain features available through the Website, we may require the use of encryption technologies provided for your protection and/or your use of a UserID and password after setting up a User Account.  We use reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of your UserID, password, User Account information and credit card information by utilizing an SSL connection.  Accordingly, your UserID, password, User Account information and credit card information are encrypted using an SSL connection and are not expected to be read in an intelligible form as they travel to the Website.  You, however, are ultimately responsible for protecting your UserID, password, User Account information and credit card information from disclosure to third parties, and you are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption technologies.  You agree to:  (a) immediately notify Anatomical Justice of any unauthorized use of your UserID, password and/or User Account, and/or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your User Account at the end of each session.  While we may provide certain encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect your confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not and cannot guarantee or warrant that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions are free from delay, interruption, interception or error.
Privacy Outside the Website
The Website contains various links to other websites, including links to various third party service providers.  Anatomical Justice is not and cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of those other websites.  Other than under agreements with certain reputable organizations and companies, and except for third party service providers whose services you voluntarily elect to utilize, we do not share any of the personal information that you provide to us with any of the websites to which the Website links, although we may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable data with those other websites.  Please check with those websites in order to determine their privacy policies and your rights under them.
Your Consent To This Privacy Policy
By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as specified above or as we otherwise see fit unless you inform us otherwise by means of the procedure identified below.  If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will make an effort to post those changes on this web page so that you will always be able to understand what information we collect, how we use that information and under what circumstances we may disclose that information to others.  We may use comments, information or feedback that you may submit in any manner that we may choose without notice or compensation to you.
