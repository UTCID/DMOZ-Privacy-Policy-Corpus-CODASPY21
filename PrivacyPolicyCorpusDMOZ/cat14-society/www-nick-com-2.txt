You and VII agree to submit to individual arbitration the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or VII, except that you and VII agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Section 17(1): (A) any Claim filed by you or VII with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, VII, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to content that you upload to or share on the Site and/or (B) you or VII may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in "GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION LOCATION, JURISDICTION, VENUE, JURISDICTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER" below in connection with any Claim whereby you or VII, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Section 17 (1)(A)), where such Claim under this Section 17(1)(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Section 17(2) below; provided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with this Section of the Agreement. You and VII agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of this Section of the Agreement will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-9 ("FAA"). Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneys' fees). "Claim(s)" means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or VII relating to the Site and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, this Site's Privacy Policy and any additional terms that govern certain products and/or services which are presented in conjunction with those products and/or services, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies which we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.2. Informal Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to Claims described in Section 17 (1)(B) above, before either you or VII pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or VII must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim. You may send a written notice of your Claim to VII at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: ViacomCBS, General Counsel. VII may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, VII account or any physical or other address VII has for you. The notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim. Except with respect to Claims described in Section 17(1)(B) above, you and VII agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and VII do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in this Section of the Agreement or court as permitted by Section 17(1) above.3. Arbitration Proceedings and Costs. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules, and other information about the AAA, are available at the AAA's website at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website (see "Demand for Arbitration, Consumer Arbitration Rules", under Rules and Forms, Consumer Forms, at https://www.adr.org, but contact the AAA if you have issues locating the form) and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location described in "GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION LOCATION, JURISDICTION, VENUE, JURISDICTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER" below. As required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed form to VII, which should be sent to VII at the following address: 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: ViacomCBS, General Counsel. If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules. In all cases, you and VII shall exchange documents and other information that you or VII intend to use in the arbitration.Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to $75,000, VII will reimburse you for all necessary filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if you wish VII to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must request payment of such fees by VII by mail to the AAA along with your form initiating arbitration and VII will make arrangements to pay such fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse VII for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by VII on your behalf. You agree that VII shall have no obligation to pay any other fees except as determined by the arbitrator.For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to the maximum extent permitted by law. The decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.4. Class Action Waiver. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 17(5)), YOU AND VII AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. You and VII expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and VII, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 17(1) of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding. The arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 17(1) of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 17(1) of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and VII, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable. Neither you nor VII consent to class arbitration.5. Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
