Privacy Policy
What personal information do we gather and how do we use it? When you order, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
When you sign up for services like newsletters or download certain software or plug-ins made available by us through our site, we need only an email address and your name -- which we use to send the information you requested.
When you submit a customer review, we also ask for your email address and your name but we will not display your email address with your review. This is for our reference purposes so we can get in touch with you.
We may personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases and site behaviour to shape our recommendations about the books, CDs, and other merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site.
We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the web site, new FSMegamall.com services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, visit Your Account to change your preferences. Make sure to change your preferences for each account or email address you have left with us.How does FSMegamall.com protect customer information?
FSMegamall.com uses the latest encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All your ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number -- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, your credit card information will not be stored in our system. We're so certain that our online order systems are secure that we back it up with a guarantee. In the unlikely event that you are subject to fraudulent charges, remember to first notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If, for whatever reason, you are held responsible for any fraudulent charges made on our site, FSMegamall.com will cover the entire liability for you, up to $50, as long as the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made from FSMegamall.com while using our secure server. Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to fax in your credit card information and complete your purchase by mail order. (For details, please email us at sales [at] fsmegamall.com).What about "cookies"?"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.
