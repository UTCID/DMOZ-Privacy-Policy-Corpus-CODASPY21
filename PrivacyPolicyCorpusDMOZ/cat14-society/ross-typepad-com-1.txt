Privacy Victory for Employee Email Monitoring
Yesterday a Federal Appeals Court limited the ability of employers to monitor employee email and text messages.  EFF's summary:This ruling has two privacy friendly results. First, the police need a
warrant to get your email and text messages if stored for less than 180
days. Second, even if your employer pays for your use of third party
text or email services, your boss can’t get copies of your messages
from that provider without your permission. Wow.The case wasn't about personal accounts (60% of users have two or more email accounts), but personal messaging through corporate outsourced services.  I wonder how this applies to port 80.  Did we just gain more privacy protection for Facebook messaging?
