Legal Project Management
An integrated firm, Hicksons offers clients a co-ordinated approach between its practice groups. For our clients, the ability of the workers compensation, employment, insurance and workplace health and safety teams to provide fully coordinated advice and strategic approaches can result in significant cost and time savings and proactive risk reduction and management.
This holistic approach can result in significant costs savings for clients, reduce the chance of conflict between sectors and offer certainty and provide lasting benefits and results.
We provide practical, strategic and commercial advice to both employer (public and private sector) and employee clients and our teams can advise on the full range of employment, industrial, discrimination and workplace health and safety (WHS) matters.
We keep clients up to date on developments in their industry so they are well equipped to manage workplace situations and proactively identify issues and solutions.
Our teams can make sure that the best practice contracts and HR policies are in place, coupled with specialised training provided to support their implementation.
We can guide clients through employee issues, workplace investigations, terminations of employment and responses to discrimination matters to reduce the risks of claims.
If a claim is made, we can advise through all stages of the process: from the drafting of the initial response to conciliation and mediation or, if unavoidable, a fully contested hearing, keeping clients’ interests firmly in mind and doing our best to achieve the right commercial and strategic outcome.
Our experience acting for employers equips us to assist employees.
We will advise against unmeritorious claims but, in the event of proceeding with a claim, will work hard to get an outcome that maximises the benefits and minimises the stress.
Bullying and harassment
Our tailored bullying and harassment prevention package has been designed to provide employers with all the tools and training organisations need to help prevent bullying and harassment – including cyber bullying. We have specialists in public and private sector matters, including the education sector.

Unfair Dismissal
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on Australian businesses, with many either making or considering the difficult decision to terminate employment relationships. This has resulted in a record number of Unfair Dismissal claims. In this video, Employment Law Partner, Warwick Ryan, guides employers through the steps to mitigate the prospect of an unfair dismissal claim and how to manage any potential liability should a claim arise.
