When you apply for a job with us, we may collect your name, address, phone number, email address, education

your background and experience. We may also require electronic samples of your work.
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order.
We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that
order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product
and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent
necessary to complete that order.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to be used by our
sales and marketing departments. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals
visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
About the Emails We Send:
We use a third-party email service, iContact, to send our email newsletters. While you will receive
transactional emails from us regarding the status of orders you place, no marketing email will
ever be sent to you without your express and deliberate opt-in to our email lists. Any information
you provide us, such as your email address, to contact you through iContact will be used only for
that purpose. iContact also complies with any and all regulations designed to protect user data.
View their privacy policy at
https://www.icontact.com/legal/privacy.
We also, at times, use a third-party service, OptinMonster, to collect email information.
You are never required to provide your name or email address if you do not wish to subscribe to our content.
Any information you provide us, including your name or email address, will be used to subscribe you to
the list(s) for which you have expressly asked to sign up. OptinMonster also complies with any and all
regulations designed to protect user data. You can view their privacy policy at
https://optinmonster.com/privacy/.
If ever you decide to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from us, there are links included
in every email that is sent to enable you to remove yourself from our list(s). You can also manage
your email contact preferences by emailing CustomerService@Llewellyn.com and indicate the email lists
from which you would like to be removed.
Credit Card Payments:
To pay for your order, you have the option to use a credit card.
We use a third-party credit card
collection and processing service.
At no time is your credit card information stored on our servers.
We cannot see your credit card number at all other than the last 4 digits as reported by this service
for verification purposes.
Passively Collected Information:
When you access our Sites, we automatically collect your computer or device's internet protocol (IP)
address and other technical information about your computer or device and website usage, such as your
browser type and version, time zone setting, and operating system and platform. This information is
only used to prevent malicious use of our websites and is regularly removed from our systems.
Our Commitment to Data Security:
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or
maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website
is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access or Correct Your Information:
You can access your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by sending
your request to;
Customer Service

better safeguard your information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by logging into your account
on our website and updating the information or by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity
before granting access or making corrections.
GDPR Right to Erasure (Right To Be Forgotten):
Article 17 of the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) states that you have the right to
contact us and request that we remove your personally identifying information from our systems.
If you

Customer Service - GDPR
Llewellyn Worldwide, LTD.
2143 Wooddale Drive
