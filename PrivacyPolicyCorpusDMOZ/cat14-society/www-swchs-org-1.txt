Southwest Christian High School Privacy Policy
Cancellations
If an individual cancels at least five (5) business days before an extra-curricular class,
camp, or event begins, fees will be refunded in full. The full fee remains due for an
extra-curricular class, camp, or event canceled five (5) or fewer business days in
advance. If an extra-curricular class or camp must be canceled, please call
952.556.0040 to speak with our finance office.
Refunds
While it is not the practice of Southwest Christian High School to return gifts or fees
once they are made, we do acknowledge instances in which a donation or registration is
made in error. Common examples include: making more than one gift in a given time
period, miscommunication between spouses or partners, etc.
In that event, the School will first suggest applying the gift/fee to the next fiscal year or
transferring the gift/fee to another program or initiative. If neither of those options meet
the donors’ intentions, the School will issue a full refund.
Guarantee
All extra-curricular classes and camps are offered with a money-back satisfaction
guarantee.
