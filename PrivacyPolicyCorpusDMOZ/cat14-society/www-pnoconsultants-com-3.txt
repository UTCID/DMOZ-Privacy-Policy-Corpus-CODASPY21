What is a “cookie”?
A “cookie” is a text file containing small amounts of information which downloads to your personal computer or mobile device when you visit a website.

Others are used to provide you with advertising tailored to your interests or to measure the number of site and page visits.

Some cookies are installed only for the duration of your visit to a website; these are called session based cookies. They automatically expire when you close your browser. Another type of cookie would remain on your device for a period of time. These are known as persistent cookies.
