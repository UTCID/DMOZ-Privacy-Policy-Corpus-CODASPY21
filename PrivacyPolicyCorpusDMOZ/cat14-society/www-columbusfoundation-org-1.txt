Privacy Policy
This website is owned and operated by The Columbus Foundation. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information entrusted to us. Your right to privacy is very important to us. We recognize that providing The Columbus Foundation with your personal information is an act of trust. The following Privacy Policy was developed to assure you that we take seriously our responsibility to protect customer information, and use it only in ways that are consistent with your wishes.
Our Policy
At our site we don’t collect personally identifiable information about individuals unless they knowingly provide it to us. So, if you just want to browse and learn about our services, programs, and benefits, we invite you to do so. As a casual, unregistered visitor to our site we’ll recognize your home server, but not your e-mail address or any other personal or system information.
If you are a Columbus Foundation donor and want to access information about your fund, it will be necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information. This may include your name, address, email address, and phone number. Any information you provide is downloaded from the web server and maintained in a secure system. Changes to your information online may only occur after you have logged in with a registered user name and password.
Our Customer Lists
When you register to receive information, such as an e-Newsletter, or identify your areas of interest, we add your name to our customer list. Once you provide us with personal or professional information, that data remains confidential and will only be used by The Columbus Foundation. We will not share any information you provide to us with any other organization. We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes.
Communication From Us
We use our customer lists for follow-up contacts with you. This is our way of keeping you up to date on our services, programs, and benefits. This also enables you to receive current information about the local, national, and global community to better meet your philanthropic needs. We maintain e-mail mailboxes in an effort to support customers who visit us online. We read every e-mail message that we receive and do our best to respond within 48 hours, if a response is required. We do not record your e-mail address unless you have voluntarily provided it to us when you register to receive follow-up information or an e-newsletter. If you do provide us with your e-mail address, and register your interest in receiving follow-up information, we may notify you from time to time about Columbus Foundation products, services, and benefits. At all times, we include “opt-out” instructions with the e-mail that is sent to you. You can update or delete your account information and preferences or “opt-out” at any time.
Cookies
We use “cookies” (small pieces of information stored on your computer) on certain parts of our website. The cookies allow us to track your session, particularly when you access your donor account. We do not use cookies to collect any type of personal information or to extract any information from your computer.
Security Online
When using our forms to register or receive information from The Columbus Foundation, we use secure pages to ensure that the information sent between your computer and our system is secure. We use the Secure Service Layer (SSL) encryption method for all secure submissions. This method is generally accepted to insure that the transmission of personal information is secure. Some common browsers, i.e. Internet Explorer, make it obvious when information is being passed in a secure manner by displaying either a completed key or a closed lock on the screen.
