YUTorah Site Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy
governs your
use of the YUTorah website (the “Site”).  Yeshiva
University and/or one or more of its
constituent schools or affiliated entities (collectively,
“YESHIVA” or “we” or
“us”) publishes and maintains the Site.  This
Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with Personal
Information
(as defined below) that we collect through the Site.  By
visiting the Site, you agree to the terms
of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time.  This
Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and
part of, the Site’s Terms
of Use,
which also govern your use of the Site.
This Privacy Policy
does
not
apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain,
other
than through the Site, such as by phone, through postal mail and
through other
live and print media.
In addition, to
the extent that you submit any Personal Information to any third party
(for
example, via a third party software application or service that is
included in
the Site), the third party’s collection, use and disclosure
of such information
may be governed by its privacy policy, and not by our Privacy Policy.  YESHIVA
is not responsible for the
information collection, usage and disclosure practices of third parties.
Purpose
Your privacy is a
serious matter
to us.  This
Privacy Policy explains, in
general, what Personal Information and other information is collected
on the
Site, how the information is used, and with whomwe may share such
information.  Please
take a few minutes to read our Privacy
Policy so that you understand how YESHIVA treats your information.
Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act
YESHIVA has a policy
to
comply
with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (aka
“FERPA”).
Our FERPA policy is available
for your review
here.
What
Information is Collected on the Site?
In order to make your
use of the
Site as worthwhile as possible, we may gather three basic types of
information
through the Site:  Personal
Information,
Non-Personal Information and Internet Protocol Addresses.
Personal Information
Personal
information is any information that identifies you as an individual and
includes, for example, name; address; photos; e-mail address;
telephone,
wireless and/or fax number; short message service or text message
address or
other wireless device address; instant messaging address; or credit
card
number.
You
do not have
to provide Personal Information to access and use the public areas of
the Site.
However, in order for you to
have access and
use of certain restricted areas and features of the Site, we may
require that
you provide Personal Information.
We
collect
Personal Information from users of the Site, through users’
activities,
transactions and completion of online forms such as when users register
or
subscribe for accounts or features on the Site, make online donations,
order
event tickets, complete surveys, join online communities, create
profile pages,
upload photographs, contribute to open forums that we may make
available on or
through the Site, submit a comment or question to us using a
“contact us” or
similar feature on the Site, send us an e-mail, or in any other way
submit
Personal Information to us via the Site.
Non-Personal Information
When
you visit
and interact with the Site, YESHIVA and its third-party service
providers may
collect Non-Personal Information (for example, a catalog of Site pages
you
visit).  Non-Personal
Information is generally
collected through the Site from different sources: (i) cookies; (ii)
clear GIFs
and similar technologies; (iii) environmental variables; and (iv)
information
that you voluntarily provide.
Cookies
We
and our
service providers may use “cookies” to keep, and
sometimes track, information
about you.  Cookies
are small data files
that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and
stored
on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies
are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for
recordkeeping and other purposes.  Cookies
are an industry standard used by most websites, and can facilitate
users'
ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause
damage
to your computer systems or files.  If
you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there
is a
simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically
decline
cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the
transfer of a
particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your
computer.  To
learn more about cookies, please click http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
Clear GIFs
We
and our
service providers may use “clear GIFs” (aka
“Web beacons” or “pixel tags”)
or
similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you
to
enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a
message.  A
clear GIF is typically a one-pixel,
transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located
on a
Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is used to,
among
other things, track the actions of Site users and e-mail recipients, to
determine
the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics
about
Site usage and response rates.
Environmental Variables
We
and our
service providers may also collect certain environmental variables,
such as
your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen
resolution, OS
version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version.  These
environmental variables are collected by
most websites, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.
Information That You Voluntarily Provide
YESHIVA
also
collects Non-Personal Information (e.g., demographic information, your
interests, your geographic location) when you voluntarily provide such
information to us.  This
information is
Non-Personal Information because, unless combined with Personal
Information, it
does not personally identify you or any other user.  Additionally,
we may aggregate Personal
Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally
identify
you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal
Information
to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular
telephone area
code.  Such
aggregate information is
considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Policy.
IP Address
Our
servers
automatically collect data about your server’s Internet
address when you visit
us.  This
information, known as an
Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s
automatically assigned
to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever
you’re on the
Internet.  When
you request pages from the
Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain
name.  Our
server may also record the referring page
that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the
pages you
visit on the Site; the website you visit after the Site; other
information
about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and
settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on the Site
or a
referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web
servers.
We
and our
service providers use this information for internal system
administration, to
help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site.  Such
information may also be used to gather
broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet
Service
Provider.
How
do we use information collected?
Personal Information
We
will use the
Personal Information you provide to the Site, for example, to fulfill
your
requests for our programs and services, to respond to your inquiries
about our
offerings, and to offer you other programs or services that we believe
may be
of interest to you.  We
sometimes use
this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we
make
changes to our services, to fulfill a request by you, to process
transactions
or to contact you about your relationship with us.  We
may also use your Personal Information for
internal business and record keeping purposes.  We
may send you notices (e.g. in the form of
e-mails, mailings), and otherwise correspond with you, about programs
and
events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.  You
may opt out of receiving certain notices
from us by following the instructions in the Choices section below.
Non-Personal
Information
Because
Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use
such
information for any purpose.  In
addition, we reserve the right to share Non-Personal Information with
third
parties for any purpose.
In
some
instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information or IP Addresses with
Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographic
location).  If
we do combine any
Non-Personal Information or IP Addresses with Personal Information, we
will
treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is
combined.
How
do we share Personal Information collected?
Public Forums
When
you
contribute to a public area or feature of the Site, such as a chat
room,
community, bulletin board, list serve, personal Web page, calendar,
news group,
blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through
the
Site, the information that you submit may be made available to the
general
public.  For
this reason, we recommend
that you exercise caution when submitting any sensitive information,
including
your full name, home address, phone number, other information that
would enable
other users to locate you, or financial information on these areas of
the Site.
Within
many of these public forums,
YESHIVA provides you privacy options that allow you to restrict the use
and
viewability of your Personal Information to others.
Third-Party Offers
We
may provide
visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other third-party
entities that
have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest
to you.  Unless
you elect not to receive such offers by
following the instructions in the Choices section above, we may from
time to
time provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they
may send
you these offers.
Service Providers
We
may use
third-party service providers to help operate the Site and provide
services
including but not limited to data analysis, payment processing, order
fulfillment and other services of an administrative nature.  We
may share Personal Information about you
with these third parties for the purpose of enabling them to provide
services
to you or to us (for example, if you choose to make a purchase through
the
Site, we may share your Payment Information or other Personal
Information with
our third party service providers to fulfill your purchase, including,
to
process your credit card or payment account number or to ship products
to you).
Legally Compelled Disclosures; Emergencies
We
may disclose
Personal Information to others as we believe to be appropriate (a)
where
permitted or required by applicable law; (b) to comply with legal
process; (c)
to respond to requests from governmental or public authorities; (d) to
enforce
our Terms of Use; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect the
rights,
privacy, safety or property of YESHIVA, you or others; and (g) to
permit us to pursue
available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
Assignment
We reserve the right
to
transfer
any and all information that we collect from Site users to a third
party in the
event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment,
transfer
or other disposition of all or any portion of YESHIVA’s
operation or assets
(including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or
similar
proceedings).
Processing
of Transactions
When you make a
purchase
or
donation through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or
other payment
account number (for example, your wireless account number), billing
address and
other information related to such purchase (collectively, "Payment
Information") from you, and may use Payment Information in order to
fulfill your purchase or donation.  We
may also provide Payment Information, or other Personal Information
provided by
you, to third parties as necessary to complete your transaction (for
example,
to process your credit card or payment account number).  To
the extent that Payment Information
includes Non- Personal Information, use of Non- Personal Information is
governed by the section on Non-Personal Information below.
We also may use
third-party
payment services (each, a "Payment Service") to collect payments made
through the Site.  If
you wish to make a
payment through the Site using third-party payment services, you will
be
directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the
Payment
Service's service providers) and not by YESHIVA (such page, the
"Payment
Service Page").  Any
Personal
Information that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be
collected
by Payment Service and not by YESHIVA, and will be subject to Payment
Service's
privacy policy, rather than this Policy.  YESHIVA
has no control over, and shall not be
responsible for, Payment Service's use of information collected through
the
Payment Service Page.
Choices
You may have the
right
to make
choices (“opt in” and “opt
out”) of certain of our uses of your Personal Information.
For
example, at the time you are
requested to provide Personal Information on the Site, you may have the
opportunity to elect whether to receive certain types of correspondence
from
us, or to whether your information will be shared with third parties
for marketing
purposes.  You
may also make a request
regarding how your information is used by sending an e-mail to admin@yutorah.org
or by
clicking on an opt-out link within an e-mail you receive.  Clearly
indicate what choices you are making
(electing not to receive promotional communications message from
YESHIVA or
requesting that we not share information with third parties for the
third
parties’ marketing purposes).  Please
understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence
from us,
we may still contact you in connection with your relationship,
activities,
donations and communications with us.
Please note that if
you
opt-out
as described above, we will not be able to remove Personal Information
about
you from the databases of third parties with which we have already
shared
Personal Information as of the date on which we implement your opt-out
request.
If
you wish to cease receiving
marketing-related e-mails from third parties, please contact the third
parties
directly or use any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective
privacy
policies or marketing-related e-mails.
Wireless
Addresses
If the e-mail address
you provide
to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages at
such address
from YESHIVA (unless and until you have elected not to receive such
messages by
following the instructions in the Choices section above).  You
understand that your wireless carrier’s
standard rates apply to these messages, and that you may change your
mind at
any time by following the instructions in the Choices section above.  You
represent that you are the owner or
authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be
received, and
that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.
Access
and Correction
If you would like to
access
Personal Information we have collected about you through the Site or if
you
would like to update, correct or limit the use of any Personal
Information you
have provided to us via the Site, please email us at admin@yutorah.org.
For your protection,
we
will only
implement such requests with respect to the Personal Information
associated
with the particular email address that you use to send us your request,
and we
may need to verify your identity before implementing your request and
consistent with applicable law.  You
must
clearly indicate the Personal Information that you wish to have
changed,
clearly indicate that you wish to have your Personal Information or
clearly
indicate the limitations you wish to put on our use of your Personal
Information.  We
will endeavor to comply
with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
We
may need to retain certain information for
recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that
will
remain within our databases and other records, which will not be
removed.
Security
While YESHIVA will
use
reasonable
organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect the
security
and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to the Site,
due to
the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications
vehicle,
we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the
Internet
or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be
absolutely safe
from intrusion by others, such as hackers.  Please
do not send us sensitive information through
email.
You may be able to
create an
account on the Site with a username and password.  You
are responsible for maintaining the strict
confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible
for any access
to or use of the Site by you or any person or entity using your
password,
whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf
of you,
and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent.  You
agree to (a) immediately notify YESHIVA by
contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below of
any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of
security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of
each
session.  We
will not be responsible or
liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with
this
provision.
In the unlikely event
that we
believe that the security of your Personal Information in our
possession or control
may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that
development. If a
notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as
possible
under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail
address, we may
notify you by e-mail.  You
consent to our
use of e-mail as a means of such notification.  If
you prefer for us to use another method to
notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at admin@yutorah.org
with the alternative contact
information you wish to be used.
Consent
to Processing
By providing Personal
Information
to the Site, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance,
processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States
and
other countries and territories.
Third-Party
“Linked-To” Sites
When you are on the
Site
you may have
the opportunity to visit, or link to, other websites not operated by
YESHIVA.  These
websites may collect Personal
Information about you.  YESHIVA
does not
control websites that are operated by these entities and is not
responsible for
the information practices of these websites.  This
Privacy Policy does not address the
information practices of those other websites.  If
you provide any Personal Information
through any such third party website, your transaction will occur on
such third
party’s website, and the Personal Information you provide
will be collected by and
controlled by the privacy policy of that third party.
Changes
to this Privacy Policy
YESHIVA reserves the
right to
change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other of our policies or
practices,
at any time, and will notify users of the Site by posting such changed
or
updated Privacy Policy on this page.  Any
changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the
Site.  Under
certain circumstances, we may also elect
to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy by additional
means,
such as posting a notice on the front page of the Site to sending you
an
e-mail.  You
can determine when this
Privacy Policy was last updated by referring to the “LAST
UPDATED” date above.
Note
Regarding the Use of the Site by Children
The Site is not
directed
to
individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such
individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Site.
