Under no circumstances will we sell, rent or give your private information including name, address, or email to third parties.
We collect name and address information solely for the purpose of the delivery of goods.

Individual users are not identified in Website statistics. These statistics are used to improve the site and monitor traffic.
If you would like to view, modify or delete the information that we hold on you as a user of this website or customer, write to us through our contact us form or PO Box 1830, Northriding, 2162, South Africa and we will be happy to co-operate.
