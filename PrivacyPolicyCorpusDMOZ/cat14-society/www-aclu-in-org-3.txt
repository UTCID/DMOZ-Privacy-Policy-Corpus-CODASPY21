The ACLU of Indiana can help you if you think your rights have been violated by a government agency or organization, including town government, schools, police officers or the state of Indiana. Among the issues we can address:
Freedom of speech
Freedom of religion
Police misconduct
Censorship in public schools or libraries
Fairness in school or prison discipline
Privacy and other protections from government intrusion
Inhumane jail or prison conditions
Unfair treatment by government
There are some cases that we do not get involved in, such as evictions, landlord-tenant disputes, criminal prosecutions, divorce and personal abuse, child custody or wills.
If you believe your constitutional rights have been violated, you can
file a complaint with the ACLU online,
email us at intake@aclu-in.org or
mail intake requests to:ACLU of Indiana1031 East Washington StreetIndianapolis, IN 46202
But first, please make sure your case fulfills the following:
Your civil liberties have been violated by a government entity
Your issue concerns a right or freedom protected by the U.S. or Indiana Constitutions
You are the person or party whose constitutional rights have been violated
We do not accept complaints from third parties, or complaints made on behalf of someone else. Please note that as our office puts additional precautions into effect due to COVID-19, we have limited resources and are unable to pursue every case that comes to our attention. We will make every effort to respond to your complaint within 8 to 12 weeks. If we do take your case and represent you, our services are free.
