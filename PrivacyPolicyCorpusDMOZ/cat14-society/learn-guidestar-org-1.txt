Access to the registration-based products
To obtain access to Registration-Based Products, you will be required to register with us. Children under the age of 13 may not register for any of the Registration-Based Products.

If You are an entity or governmental agency, You will, upon purchasing any of GuideStar's Fee-Based Products that permit access by one or more of your authorized users, be permitted to designate those of Your authorized users who will be permitted to access such Fee-Based Product on Your behalf, subject to the maximum number of authorized users to which You are permitted to grant access to such Fee-Based Product, as provided in the license agreement, subscription agreement or other agreement pursuant to which You purchased such Fee-Based Product (collectively, “License Agreements”). Such authorized users must complete GuideStar's registration process in order to receive passwords that will permit them to access such Fee-Based Product. (For the avoidance of doubt, if you are an authorized user of an entity or governmental agency (including, without limitation, a library) that has purchased one or more Fee-Based Products, all of the rights, obligations and agreements stated in these terms of use as applicable to "You" shall apply equally to you as such an authorized user.)

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the user name and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your user name or password. If You are an entity or governmental agency, you are responsible for all activities that occur under the user names and passwords of Your authorized users.
You are responsible for ensuring that no unauthorized person will have access to Your user name, password or account. It is Your sole responsibility to monitor and control access to and use of Your user name, password and account. Your user name, password and account are not transferable. You grant GuideStar and all other persons and entities involved in the operation of the GuideStar Site the right to transmit, monitor, store, retrieve and use Your information in connection with the operation of the GuideStar Site.

"Patron" means an individual member of the public authorized to access and use a library in accordance with the rules and policies applicable to such library.
GuideStar reserves the right, for any reason and without notice, in its sole discretion, to terminate, change, suspend, or interrupt access, in whole or in part, to the GuideStar Site.

During each monthly or yearly term, as applicable, and each renewal term, of Your subscription to a Fee-Based Product for which downloading of Information is permitted, Your and Your authorized users (if any) acting on Your behalf shall be limited to downloading up to such total number of Records as set forth from time to time on such subscription management page.

All download limitations will be enforced at Our sole discretion.
Systematic access to or extraction of content from any Fee-Based Product or downloaded file or Information (as determined by GuideStar in Our sole discretion), including, but not limited to, the use of "bots" or "spiders", is strictly prohibited. Without limiting any other provision of these terms of use, We reserve the right to monitor Your use of the GuideStar Site and any Registration-Based Product or Fee-Based Product to ensure compliance with these terms of use (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section) and any License Agreement for a Fee-Based Product, and to prevent fraudulent use. Such monitoring of use may include but shall not be limited to determining whether or not the GuideStar Site or any Fee-Based Product is accessed under Your account from multiple computers, as well as noting downloads beyond the limit of the total number of allowable Records as may be set forth with respect to Your subscription to a Fee-Based Product for which downloading is permitted, or a disproportionate number of users. If such monitoring indicates You (or your authorized users, if any) are not in compliance with these terms of use (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section) or the License Agreement with respect to such Fee-Based Product, or if fraudulent activity is suspected, GuideStar reserves the right to take such action as it deems necessary, including, but not limited to, suspension or termination of your rights under these terms of use and any and all License Agreements for Fee-Based Products, and any and all of Your account(s).

Use of the GuideStar Community
GuideStar has elected to provide the GuideStar Community to you so that you may interact with and exchange information with other members of the nonprofit community.

GuideStar reserves the right to deny access to any Communications Service to anyone who violates this visitor agreement or who, in our judgment, interferes with the ability of others to enjoy our Service or infringes the rights of others.

Spam
We will immediately terminate any account which we believe is being used to transmit, or is otherwise connected with, any spam or other unsolicited bulk email in connection with any messaging service made available through the Service.

Otherwise you agree to pay our actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
