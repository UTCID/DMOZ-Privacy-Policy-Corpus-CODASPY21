Home / Helpful Information / Safeguarding Policy
Retirement Villages Group acknowledges the duty of care to safeguard and promote the welfare of both vulnerable adults and children within its environments and is committed to ensuring safeguarding practice reflects statutory responsibilities, government guidance and complies with best practice and both local safeguarding adult and children arrangements.
This policy statement recognises that the welfare and interests of vulnerable adults is paramount and aims to ensure that regardless of age, gender, religion or beliefs, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or socioeconomic background, all adults are protected from abuse.
Retirement Villages Group acknowledges that some vulnerable adults, including those disabled or from ethnic minority communities, can be particularly vulnerable to abuse and we accept the responsibility to take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure their welfare whilst in our care.
As part of our safeguarding arrangements Retirement Villages Group will:
Promote and prioritise the safety and wellbeing of both vulnerable adults and children and young people
Ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in respect of safeguarding and is provided with appropriate learning opportunities to recognise, identify and respond to signs of abuse, neglect and other safeguarding concerns relating to both vulnerable adults, children and young people
Ensure appropriate action is taken in the event of incidents/concerns of abuse and support provided to the individual/s who raise or disclose the concern
Ensure that confidential, detailed and accurate records of all safeguarding concerns are maintained and securely stored
Prevent the employment/deployment of unsuitable individuals
Ensure robust safeguarding arrangements and procedures are in operation.
Local policy and procedures will be widely promoted and are mandatory for everyone involved in Retirement Villages Group. Failure to comply with the policy and procedures will be addressed without delay and may ultimately result in dismissal/exclusion from the organisation.
Local policy will be reviewed every three years, or in the following circumstances:
Changes in legislation and/or government guidance
