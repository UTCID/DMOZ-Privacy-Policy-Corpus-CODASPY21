"Labyrinths provide us with a path to practice change.”/  LEA GOODE-HARRIS, PH.D. /
I learned early on that one of the only guarantees in life is change. In a world where we hold on so tight, how do we deal with the many changes of our modern era? Making art, cooking wholesome, delicious food, designing and creating labyrinths and having daily mindfulness-practices have helped me to navigate the many challenges and changes that I’ve encountered in life. I am passionate about creating spaces of beauty and helping others to do the same.
