ECT News Network Terms of Service
Updated December 27, 2019
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
ECT News Network, Inc. (“ECT News Network, “we,” “our,”
“us”) provides access to and use of the ECT News Network
Web sites, which include
ECTNews.com,
EcommerceTimes.com,
TechNewsWorld.com,
CRMBuyer.com and
LinuxInsider.com
(collectively "ECT News Sites") subject to
these Terms of Service (“TOS”).
Unless explicitly stated
otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current ECT
News Sites shall be subject to this TOS.
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THE ECT NEWS SITES
CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THE TOS. ECT News Network may amend this
TOS at any time by posting the amended TOS to the ECT News Sites, and
you acknowledge and agree that your continued use of the ECT News
Sites after any such change represents your agreement to the amended
TOS.
YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
By registering for account access on the ECT News Sites, you agree to
provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as
prompted (such information being the “Profile Data”) and
maintain and promptly update the Profile Data to keep it accurate,
current and complete.
If you provide any information that is
inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or ECT News Network has
reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is inaccurate,
not current or incomplete, ECT News Network may deny you access to
areas requiring registration, at its sole discretion.
ACCOUNT PASSWORD AND SECURITY
The ECT News Sites contain some features that require registration
(“Restricted Areas”).
At the time of registration for
online account access, you will be asked to choose a Username and
Password.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
the Password, and are fully responsible for all uses of your account,
whether by you or others.
You agree to (a) keep your Password
confidential and not share it with anyone else; (b) immediately
notify ECT News Network of any unauthorized use of your Password or
account or any other breach of security; and (c) use only your
Password to access the ECT News Sites’ Restricted Areas.
ECT
News Network cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
arising from your failure to comply with this Section, or from any
unauthorized access to your personal information not directly due to
the negligence of ECT News Network.
You acknowledge and agree that ECT News Network is authorized to act on
instructions received through use of your Password.
You further
acknowledge and agree that ECT News Network may, but is not obligated
to, deny access or block any transaction made through use of your
Password, without prior notice to you, if we believe your Password is
being used by someone other than you, or for any other reason.
As a result of your registration for the ECT News Sites, you may receive
certain commercial communications from ECT News Network related to
content found on the ECT News Sites.
You understand and agree that
these communications are part of your registration, and that you may
opt out of receiving these communications at any time by changing
your account preferences.
See our Privacy Policy.
USER CONDUCT
It is your responsibility to know, understand and abide by the ECT News Network rules of use.
These rules are not meant to be exhaustive, and ECT News Network
reserves the right to determine what types of conduct it considers to
be inappropriate use of the ECT News Sites. In the case of
inappropriate use, ECT News Network may take such measures as it sees
fit.
ECT News Network reserves the right to add to or amend this
list of rules at any time, and you are responsible for checking the
TOS for any changes each time you log on.
You are fully responsible for what you post. You agree not to use the ECT

to harm minors in any way;
to impersonate any person or entity,
including, but not limited to, an ECT News Network employee, or

malware designed to damage or reduce the functionality of any

Our Discussion Boards may be used for non-commercial purposes only. You
agree not to post spam or other advertisements or solicitations,
solicit funds, promote commercial entities, or otherwise engage in
commercial activity in our Discussion Boards. Advertising, marketing, promotion and other commercial activity may be posted in our Classifieds service. We do allow hyperlinks to our web pages. We reserve the right to remove any post, at our sole discretion, for any reason.
Use of or reliance on information obtained through the Discussion Boards or Classifieds is
at your own risk. ECT News Network provides these Discussion Boards and Classifieds for users to interact, but does not endorse any content nor vouch for its reliability. The content and views expressed on the Discussion Boards and Classifieds are strictly those of the originating author.
Do not post personal information about yourself in the Discussion Boards. The Discussion Boards can
be read by the public, and you should not post any private
information unless you want it to be available publicly.
Violation of our rules regarding the content of posts may result in the removal
of your post or the canceling of your account.
You understand that all materials submitted by users, including but not limited to Discussion Board and Classifieds postings and links (“User Materials”), whether privately transmitted or made publicly
available, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such
User Materials originated.
This means that you, not ECT News
Network, are entirely responsible for all User Materials that you
upload, post, share, email, transmit, or otherwise make available via
the ECT News Sites.
Under no circumstances will ECT News Network be
liable in any way for any User Materials uploaded, posted, shared,
emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the ECT News
Sites.
You acknowledge that ECT News Network may or may not pre-screen User
Materials, but that ECT News Network and its designees have the right
(but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen,
refuse, permanently delete, and/or move any User Materials that are
available via the ECT News Sites.
Without limiting the foregoing,
ECT News Network and its designees shall have the right to remove any
User Materials that violate the TOS or are otherwise objectionable in
ECT News Network’s sole discretion, and shall have no liability for such removal.
You understand that by
using the ECT News Sites, you may be exposed to User Materials that
you may consider to be offensive or objectionable.
You agree that
you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use or
disclosure of any User Materials.
You further acknowledge and agree

News Sites.

on the Discussion Boards, Classifieds or other publicly accessible areas of the
ECT News Sites, you grant ECT News Network an irrevocable,
assignable, fully sub-licensable, perpetual, world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, distribute, reproduce,
