Privacy Policy
We treasure your privacy.
We keep the information we gather from you behind a fire wall and safe from un-authorized access.
We will never rent or sell you private information to others.
When you sign up we ask for your name, your email address and some other information. This is so that we know who you are. We also ask you optional information such as the country you live in and how you heard about us.
All payment information is kept by PayPal. We do not have access to your credit card number or PayPal account. We like it that way.
