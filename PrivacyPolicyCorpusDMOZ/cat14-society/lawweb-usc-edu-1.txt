The University of Southern California ("USC" or the "University") is committed to safeguarding the privacy of individuals who apply for admission. This Privacy Notice outlines the University's collection, use, and disclosure of information provided by prospective students and applicants. When you submit your application to us, or otherwise provide us with information in your application for admission, or use our websites and other services, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of that information as described in this Privacy Notice.
Information Collected by Graduate Admissions

Sensitive Information also includes religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health data, or sexual orientation that may be volunteered by you in a personal essay or other information submitted with your application for admission.
The University will also collect information about any prior violations of law or criminal charges. The University is required to collect this information as part of its accreditation by the American Bar Association and to ensure that its students will have the ability to pass bar admission standards related to moral character in order to practice law after graduating.
As part of the application process, the University also collects general information from you such as your name, address, phone number, and educational background. For purposes of this Privacy Notice, "Information" refers to all other, non-sensitive information that you have provided to the University in your application.

USC will use Information that you provide to us and Information we collect about you to administer your application. In addition, we may use your Information to analyze and improve our admissions process, for outreach efforts, and for other University processes and functions related to your admission as a student.

We may use and share your Information and Sensitive Information internally with other University offices and units to support your success as a student if you are admitted. We will also share your Information with other University offices to deliver education, advising, residence, athletic, student development, and financial aid services, as well as for fundraising, if you are enrolled as a student of the University.
Third Parties
We may disclose your Information to third parties as follows:
Consent. We may use and disclose your Information to third parties if we have your consent to do so.
Parents and Guardians. In some cases, we may share your Information or Sensitive Information with a parent or guardian if necessary to properly complete the admissions process or in the event of an emergency.

Security
We seek to implement appropriate security measures to protect your Information stored on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption to protect your data. Your application account password is protected so that only you can access it and view information through your application portal. We strongly advise you not to share your password with anyone.
Retention and Destruction of your Information
Your Information will be retained by Admissions in accordance with the applicable retention periods in the University's Record Management Policy and Appendix, available at https://policy.usc.edu/record-management/.
