NCCE/MS Uniform Policy
While we hope that the students of Nouvel Catholic Central Schools are identifiable by their virtues, they are most easily recognized by their uniform. Our uniform reminds our students that we are a community. As students walk into the classroom, they do so as peers placing all their external differences aside to learn and grow together.
Please see Uniform Policy for additional details:
Sweatshirts: Gray or Navy Blue Crewneck with logo (Grades Y5-8) or ¼ zip with logo (Grades 7 & 8) are available through our Work Wear Uniform Shop. Jumpers/Skirts: Blue plaid jumper  (Grades Y5-3),  blue plaid skirts (Grades 4-8) and solid blue skirts (Grades Y5-8). Uniform Pants: Navy blue slacks (Grades Y5-6) and Khaki slacks (Grades 7 & 8).

Spirit Days
Spirit days are a special day to celebrate school spirit, held on every Friday of the month. Students may wear approved apparel, branded with a Nouvel logo.  Bottoms can be of any type including jeans, dress pants, school uniform pants, and dress shorts or skirts and must be school appropriate. Shorts and skirts must be appropriate knee length and may be worn April through October only. Sweatpants, joggers or athletic pants/shorts of any kind are NOT allowed on spirit days. All apparel must be free of rips or tears. Closed-toed boots and shoes of any style may be worn.
In partnership with local retailer, The Work Wear Store, you can now order official NCCS Spirit Wear online.  Explore Spirit Wear Here
