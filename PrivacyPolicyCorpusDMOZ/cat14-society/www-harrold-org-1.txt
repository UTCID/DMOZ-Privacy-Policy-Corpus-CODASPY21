Q & A Goodies.
Questions are taken from
www.htmlgoodies.com "HTML Goodies to Go."
Q. I'm looking for resources which offer some hints
for making my pages more easily accessible to a wide range of
people.
I'm curious if there are any online or print resources
out there that specifically address issues like the use of
certain tags and possible alternatives,
the formating of text and pictures, etc.
A. Here are a couple of sites that I use for browser compatibility:
Net Mechanics
Web Monkey
Any Browser
I get quite a bit of information from the first link, Netmechanic.

Excerpt from 'HTML Goodies to Go':
Goodies to Go (tm)
March 10, 2003 -- Newsletter 223
This newsletter is part of the internet.com network.
http://www.internet.com
Please visit http://www.htmlgoodies.com
*** This question were submitted to our Mentor Community.
The answer was provided Jim Young.
Q. I want to have a small window open when someone clicks a link on my page.
I don't want a full size window, just a small one.
Can JavaScript do this?
A. Since you will probably have more than one link on a page you should set up
a function in your head section of your document that will be used by multiple
links.
You can pass the html page you want to load in the window to the
function when the link is clicked on.
With window.open() you can set the
width, height, postion and other attributes.
Here is an example:
<.script language="javascript"> function OpenWin(linkid)
{
NewWin=window.open
(linkid,"newwin",config="width=200,height=250,location=no,status=no,directories
=
no,toolbar=no,scrollbars=no,menubar=no,resizable=no,top=30,left=30");
NewWin.focus()
}
<./script>
The variable "linkid" contains the page you want to load.
This was passed to
the function when the link was clicked on.
Then in the body section of your
document your link could look like this:
<.A HREF="javascript:OpenWin('somepage.html')">Apples<./A>
You would wrap the link around the word that you want to click on for more
info.
The HTML Goodies site does have a tutorial on window.open()
(see http://www.htmlgoodies.com/primers/jsp/hgjsp_11.html and
