Internet Privacy Issues & Violations
Privacy issues on the Internet occur due to tracking software used by websites, phishing scams, and email spam.

Data Breach Issues
If you believe your private medical records, credit or debit card information, social security number, personal or financial information has been compromised, you should consult with lawyers qualified to advise you of your rights. Shoppers at Target, Neiman-Marcus, discount retailers, medical center patients, restaurant patrons, convention attendees, holders of MasterCard, Visa and Citigroup cards, Nintendo and PlayStation users, government agencies, and email users have been victim of data breach involving stolen credit cards or bank account numbers, social security numbers, medical records and/or other personal or financial information.
Companies must make significant investments in encrypting sensitive data and preventing and detecting data security breaches to protect the privacy rights of consumers and patients. Should an unauthorized breach occur, companies need to have a plan in place for notification and response.
