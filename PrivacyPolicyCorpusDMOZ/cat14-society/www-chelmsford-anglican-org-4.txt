Safeguarding Policy, Practice Guidance, Templates & Resources
Provides the information you need to enable you to fulfil your responsibility to make your church a safe place for everyone.
In the Diocese of Chelmsford we have adopted the suite of Policy and Practice Guidance provided by the National Safeguarding Team for the Church of England.
All previous Diocesan Policy/Policy Manual documents have now been replaced with the NST Policy and Practice Guidance
Click here to access National Safeguarding Team Policy and Practice Guidance
Please note under section 5 of the Safeguarding and Clergy Discipline Measure 2016 all authorised clergy, bishops, archdeacons, licensed readers and lay workers, churchwardens and PCCs must have 'due regard' to safeguarding guidance issued by the House of Bishops (this will include both policy and practice guidance). A duty to have 'due regard' to guidance means that the person under the duty is not free to disregard it but is required to follow it unless there are cogent reasons for not doing so. ('Cogent' for this purpose means clear, logical and convincing.) Failure by clergy to comply with the duty imposed by the 2016 Measure may result in disciplinary action.

Theology & Safeguarding:
A resource to help local churches do some theological thinking around safeguarding has been published today (30th June 2016) by the Faith and Order Commission (FAOC). The text is meant to be read as a specifically theological resource alongside safeguarding policy and guidance documents from the local diocese and the national church.
The Gospel, Sexual Abuse and the Church: A theological resource for the local church is available online via www.churchofengland.org/media/2535755/theologicalresourcefaocweb.pdf and is also available to pre-order as a book from Church House Publishing (Price £5.99, ISBN 978 0 7151 1109 3) via www.chpublishing.co.uk.
