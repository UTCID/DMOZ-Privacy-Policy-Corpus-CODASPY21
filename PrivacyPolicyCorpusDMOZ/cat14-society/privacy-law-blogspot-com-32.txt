It's an interesting question. One District Court in Ohio says yes, another says no.

Will Obama Administration Reveal Extent of Wiretapping?
Bush Spy Revelations Anticipated When Obama Is Sworn InPrivacy Advocates Expect Whistleblowers to Share Warrantless Wiretap Info After Inauguration Day By RYAN SINGELABC NewsNov. 11, 2008When Barack Obama takes the oath of office on January 20, Americans won't just get a new president; they might finally learn the full extent of George W. Bush's warrantless domestic wiretapping. Since The New York Times first revealed in 2005 that the NSA was eavesdropping on citizens' overseas phone calls and e-mail, few additional details about the massive "Terrorist Surveillance Program" have emerged. That's because the Bush administration has stonewalled, misled and denied documents to Congress, and subpoenaed the phone records of the investigative reporters. Now privacy advocates are hopeful that President Obama will be more forthcoming with information. But for the quickest and most honest account of Bush's illegal policies, they say don't look to the incoming president. Watch instead for the hidden army of would-be whistle-blowers who've been waiting for Inauguration Day to open the spigot on the truth. "I'd bet there are a lot of career employees in the intelligence agencies who'll be glad to see Obama take the oath so they can finally speak out against all this illegal spying and get back to their real mission," says Caroline Fredrickson, the ACLU's Washington D.C. legislative director. New Yorker investigative reporter Seymour Hersh already has a slew of sources waiting to spill the Bush administration's administration's darkest secrets, he said in an interview last month. "You cannot believe how many people have told me to call them on January 20. [They say,]
'You wanna know about abuses and violations? Call me then.'"
