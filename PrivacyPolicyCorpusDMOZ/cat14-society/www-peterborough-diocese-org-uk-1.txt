Data Protection and Privacy – The Diocese of Peterborough
The Peterborough Diocesan Board of Finance (PDBF) commits to complying with the Data Protection Act 2018 and takes the privacy of personal data very seriously.
Like any organisation, the PDBF needs to process personal data in order to fulfil its legitimate purposes, principally the furtherance of the mission and ministry of the Anglican Church in Peterborough, Rutland and Northamptonshire. Each organisation is to have a document, known as a Privacy Notice E-Bulletin; the purpose of which is to explain to people how and why their data is being processed. Our General Privacy Notice can be downloaded from the link further down the page. This privacy notice explains the processing of personal data for clergy, licensed and authorised lay ministers, parish officers and other parish role holders, school contacts and other key contacts, and therefore covers the majority of processing of personal data.
The PDBF is a broad and diverse organisation, and therefore there are some areas of our work which have dedicated privacy notices in order to better explain the processing of personal data in each context. These can also be downloaded by clicking on the links below. These notices are being kept under regular review and the most recent versions will be uploaded to this webpage, so please do check this webpage periodically.
