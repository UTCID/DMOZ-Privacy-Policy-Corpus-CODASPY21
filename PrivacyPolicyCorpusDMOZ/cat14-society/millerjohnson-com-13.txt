Our Private Client attorneys counsel families on protecting a loved one who is legally incapable to care for themself. More than just filling out forms and making sure financial responsibilities are met, our experience with complex matters provides value to the ward (person under guardianship) in ensuring stability and a desired outcome for the entire family.
Guardianships and Conservatorships are typically used in three situations: for seniors, for minors, and for developmentally disabled adults.
A guardian is appointed to care for the personal and legal interests of someone who is incapacitated due to age, illness, or disability. Decisions regarding medical and health care, living arrangements, educational and training programs are often made by a guardian.
A conservator is appointed to care for the financial interests of someone who cannot make financial decisions due to age, illness, or disability. Conservators typically are appointed to pay the bills and manage the assets of an incapacitated person.
We work to:
Protect minor children by designating guardians and managing assets through custodianships or trusts
Avoid a formal probate court guardianship or conservatorship proceeding if disability occurs by using durable powers of attorney and/or living trusts
Represent the parent or the minor in guardianships and conservatorships
Represent the fiduciary, the incapacitated adult or the concerned family member in guardianships and conservatorships
