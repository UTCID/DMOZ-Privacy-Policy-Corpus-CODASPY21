Privacy Policy
Michael J. Hurd, Ph.D., LCSW and The Living Resources Center are committed to protecting the privacy of his clients. Information gathered during sessions and/or on written or online forms is confidential. When more than one family member is a client, every effort is made to preserve privacy among the family members, however confidentiality cannot be guaranteed under these circumstances.
Dr. Hurd and his associates never disclose personal information about clients unless required by law, regulation or in compliance with a valid legal process (i.e., subpoena, court order), without the express, written permission of the client. In the event that Dr. Hurd is legally compelled to disclose client information to a third party, the client will be notified, unless doing so will violate the law or court order.
Dr. Hurd and The Living Resources Center will not send unsolicited e-mail or texts to clients other than for purposes of session scheduling, responding to questions, comments or client feedback forms. If a client requests materials that cannot be transmitted electronically, materials can be sent via U.S. mail.
Michael J. Hurd, Ph.D., LCSW maintains clients’ individually identifiable health information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and its implementing regulations.
