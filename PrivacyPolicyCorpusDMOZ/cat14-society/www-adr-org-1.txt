AAA Portal Terms of Use
Please Read the Following Terms of Use Carefully.
This Portal (including the Online Services and all other pages under such second level domain name, collectively, the "Portal") is provided by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") subject to these terms of use, the [Privacy Policy] and all modifications of either of the foregoing (collectively, the "Terms of Use"). By using this Portal, you ("You") and other users and visitors (together with You, the "Visitors"), including parties to arbitrations and arbitrators, are deemed to have agreed to these Terms of Use.
Your access to some areas of the Portal ("Online Services") may be subject to certain membership and/or registration requirements in AAA's discretion. The Portal's Online Services includes an Internet-based alternative dispute resolution system through which You may have Your arbitration or mediation proceedings conducted online, as administered by AAA via AAA WebFile® ("WebFile").
Your use of Web File is subject to AAA's acceptance of Your online registration and Your agreement to these Terms of Use and the applicable AAA rules and dispute resolution procedures (including but not limited to the Supplementary Procedures for On-Line Arbitration, collectively, the "AAA Rules"), which are incorporated herein by reference. You shall pay to AAA all fees owing to AAA for Your use of the Online Services (including without limitation WebFile) in accordance with the AAA Rules. Such fees are nonrefundable.
Internet Access
You acknowledge and agree that in connection with Your use of the Portal, You must: (a) provide for Your own access to the World Wide Web and pay any service fees associated with such access, and (b) provide all equipment necessary for You to make such access and connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer, software and a means of connecting to or accessing the Internet. AAA shall not be responsible for any malfunctions, errors, crashes or other adverse events that may occur from Your use of the Portal.
Portal Content
This Portal contains content, including but not limited to that which is protected by trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights owned by AAA and others ("Portal Content"). As between You and AAA, AAA is the sole owner of all rights, title and interest in and to Portal Content. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Your use of the Portal does not grant to You a license to any Portal Content. You may not download, archive or save a copy of the Portal for any purpose, except You may download, print or make copies of individual screens and documents appearing as part of the Portal solely for Your own internal business purposes, provided that any marks, logos or other legends that appear on such screens and documents remain on, and are not removed from the downloaded, printed or stored screens or documents. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms of Use, You may not modify, copy, publish, translate, display, transmit, distribute, transfer, frame, adapt, create derivative works from or in any way exploit the Portal Content. You may not allow access to or use of the Portal, or any portion thereof, by or for the benefit of any third parties including, without limitation, providing timeshare services, service bureau services, outsourcing or consulting services. Any commercial exploitation of the Portal is strictly prohibited.
Peer Groups, Visitor Content
AAA may make available certain public and/or private forums such as bulletin boards, email lists or chat rooms (collectively, "Peer Groups") on the Portal. Use of any Peer Group is subject to these Terms of Use and any other notice or policy applicable to a particular Peer Group or Peer Groups in general. Information, data, text, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages and other content and materials that You may post to the Portal via e-mail, uploading, posting, chat room, bulletin board or otherwise, or that You otherwise supply to AAA shall be referred to herein as "Visitor Content." Visitors should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) on or through Peer Groups, that such information is generally accessible to and may be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. Visitors of the Portal are encouraged to exercise caution when providing personal information about themselves. You agree that AAA takes no responsibility and that You are solely responsible for the origination, accuracy, completeness, ownership, publication and dissemination of, and that You, and not AAA, are entirely responsible for, Your Visitor Content. By submitting or sending Visitor Content to the Portal or AAA You represent and warrant that such Visitor Content is original to You, that no other party has any rights to such Visitor Content and that such Visitor Content does not violate, infringe or misappropriate any third party right or applicable law.
Subject to any privacy and confidentiality obligations of AAA with respect to Your use of the Online Services (including WebFile), by submitting or sending Visitor Content to AAA or otherwise making Visitor Content available for display on or through the Portal, You grant AAA the royalty-free, unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Visitor Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, in connection with the Portal.
Other than under dispute resolution proceeding(s) and in connection with our e-voting Online Services, AAA does not solicit nor does it wish to receive any confidential, secret or proprietary information, personal data, or other material from You through the Portal, any of its services, by e-mail, or in any other way, and, subject to any applicable privacy and confidentiality obligations of AAA, any information or material submitted or sent to AAA will be deemed not to be confidential or secret. You agree and acknowledge that any ideas, concepts, methods, systems, designs, plans, techniques or other similar materials that You submit or otherwise communicate to the Portal, other than under Your arbitral proceeding(s) or those protected by applicable privacy or confidentiality laws or other requirements, may be used by AAA in any manner.
AAA does not pre-screen, monitor, review or otherwise edit Visitor Content posted, or otherwise made available, on or through the Portal. However, AAA (or a designee) reserves the right (but assumes no obligation) to, at its sole discretion, refuse, edit or remove any Visitor Content, in whole or part, that, in AAA's sole judgment, does not comply with these Terms of Use, is illegal, or is otherwise undesirable, inappropriate or inaccurate. AAA is not responsible for any failure, non-failure or delay in refusing, editing or removing such Visitor Content.
