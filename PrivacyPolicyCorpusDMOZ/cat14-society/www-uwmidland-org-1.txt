Donor Privacy and Data Security Policy
All donor information managed by the United Way of Midland is confidential. United Way does not distribute, sell, or rent contact or giving information of donors to any outside entity. All donor information is maintained in a secure database. Any data maintained in paper form is stored in a locked area. Data collected includes the donor’s name, home and/or business address, gift amount, telephone number(s), email addresses and spouse names in order to thank our donors and process their gifts.
If a website visitor requests electronic communication, that individual’s name and addresses will be added to our email lists. Each electronic communication contains an unsubscribe option if someone no longer wishes to receive the e-communications.
United Way does not receive or store credit card data through any online giving system. The online system used meets Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards.
United Way of Midland uses a professional technology firm to assure the security and integrity of our computer systems and records. Access to all software is limited to staff and requires individual log in credentials. Staff are routinely trained in data security best practices. Regular evaluations of all data security systems are conducted.
This privacy policy may be changed at any time. A current copy of this policy will be maintained on our website.
Any donor is welcome to contact the United Way office to inquire about their personal data. Staff are available from 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM CST Monday through Friday and can be reached at 432.685.7700.
