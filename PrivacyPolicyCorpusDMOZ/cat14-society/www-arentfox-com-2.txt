Arent Fox Legal Notice & Terms of Use
Thank you for visiting the website of
Arent Fox LLP (“Arent Fox,” “we,” “us” or “our”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your
use of the website located at www.arentfox.com and any other websites, mobiles apps, or online services where these
Terms are posted (the “Sites”).
YOUR AFFIRMATIVE ACT OF USING AND/OR REGISTERING WITH THE
SITES SIGNIFIES THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO
NOT USE AND/OR REGISTER WITH THESE SITES.
Please note the arbitration provision set forth below,
requiring you to arbitrate any claims you may have related to your use of the
Sites on an individual basis. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU

1. No Attorney-Client Relationship
The materials on this website are for informational and
educational purposes only. They are not offered as and do not constitute legal
advice or legal opinions. The materials should not be used as a substitute for
seeking professional legal advice. Your use of this website does not create an
attorney-client relationship between Arent Fox LLP and you.
The formation of an attorney-client relationship requires
prior satisfaction of multiple factors including resolution of possible
conflicts of interest, an appropriate fee arrangement and mutual agreement on
the terms of the engagement. Please do not convey to us any information that
you regard as confidential until a formal attorney-client relationship has been
established. Any information you convey to Arent Fox LLP via the Internet may
not be secure, and information conveyed prior to establishing an
attorney-client relationship may not be privileged or confidential.
This website is not intended to be advertising and Arent Fox
LLP does not wish to represent anyone desiring representation based upon
viewing this website in a state in which this website fails to comply with all
laws and ethical rules of that state.

8. Termination
We reserve the right to restrict, modify, suspend, or
terminate your access to the Sites, with or without cause or prior notice, at
any time, and without any liability to you.
9. Privacy
Arent Fox views the protection of your privacy as an
important responsibility. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)
and other information collected on or in connection with the Sites will be used
and processed as described in our Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.arentfox.com/privacy-policy. By using
the Sites, you consent to the collection and use of your PII by us as described
in the Privacy Policy.
10. Assignment
To the extent permitted by law, Arent Fox may sell,
transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your PII, in
connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of
bankruptcy. In each such event, the PII we have collected from you may be one
of the assets transferred.
11. Age Limitation
The Sites are not intended for use by persons under the age
of 13. Arent Fox does not knowingly collect information from visitors under the
age of 13 and, in the event that we learn that a person under the age of 13 has
provided Arent Fox with PII, we will delete such PII.
12. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall Arent Fox or any third parties mentioned
on the Sites be liable for any damages (including, without limitation,
incidental, consequential or other indirect damages, personal injury/wrongful
death, lost profits, or damages resulting from lost data or business
interruption) resulting from your use of or inability to use the Sites, whether
based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and whether or
not Arent Fox is advised of the possibility of such damages.
YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY OTHER DISPUTE WITH
ARENT FOX IS TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SITES OR ANY SERVICES OFFERED BY
ARENT FOX. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO
THE USE OF THE SITES EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES THAT YOU PAID US DURING A
ONE-YEAR PERIOD FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVICE AT ISSUE.
13. Dispute Resolution
By using the Sites, you and Arent Fox agree that, if there
is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your
use of the Sites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of
these Terms or any part thereof (“Dispute”), both parties shall first try in
good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other
party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the
receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice
shall be sent to Arent Fox LLP at 1717 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20006.
Both you and Arent Fox agree that this dispute resolution
procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any
litigation or filing any claim against the other party.
IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE
WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON
AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR
A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS,
CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights that you and we would
have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration,
including discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be exclusively
submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules
then in effect in the District of Columbia metropolitan area before one
arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court
or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under
or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation
of these Terms, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are
void or voidable.
14. Choice of Law and Forum
You agree that the laws of the District of Columbia govern
the Terms and any claim or dispute that you may have against us, without regard
to D.C.’s conflict of laws rules. The parties acknowledge that these Terms
evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the
foregoing with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted
pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
You further agree that any disputes or claims not subject to
the arbitration provision discussed above shall be resolved by a court located
in the District of Columbia and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal
jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or
action. PLEASE NOTE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE: (1)
WAIVING CLAIMS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AGAINST US BASED ON THE LAWS OF
OTHER JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN; (2) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTING TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS IN THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FOR ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THIS PROVISION;
AND (3) SUBMITTING YOURSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTES OR
CLAIMS.
15. Modification
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Your
continued use of the Sites after any such modifications have been made shall be
deemed to be your conclusive acceptance of any modified version of the Terms.
We will indicate that changes to the Terms have been made by updating the date
indicated after “Updated ”at the beginning or end of these Terms. If
you do not agree to abide by the initial version and any modified version of
the Terms, then you are not authorized to use the Sites.
