LLLT Examination
Updated: Dec. 5, 2020
IMPORTANT NOTICESDec. 3, 2020: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Dec. 3, 2020, the Washington Supreme Court issued an order authorizing the Washington State Bar Association to administer the winter 2021 LLLT exam remotely. A remote exam means that you will be able to take the exam using your computer at any location with a reliable internet connection. There will not be an in-person exam in Tacoma as previously scheduled.We will be using ExamSoft as the provider for the testing software. Each applicant must register with Examsoft and pay for and download the remote testing software. The cost for the remote testing software is $100. Fees paid to Examsoft are nonrefundable and nontransferable. Additional instructions for acquiring the remote testing software through Examsoft will be provided to you at a later date.We will provide additional information here as it becomes available. If you do not want to take a remote exam, you may transfer your application and fee to the July 2021 LLLT exam which is scheduled to take place in Yakima, WA. Alternatively, you may choose to withdraw from the exam completely by the appropriate deadline and receive a partial refund.Please email admissions@wsba.org if you wish to transfer or withdraw your application, or if you have any questions.Nov. 1, 2020: We are currently working on a new online admissions portal.
