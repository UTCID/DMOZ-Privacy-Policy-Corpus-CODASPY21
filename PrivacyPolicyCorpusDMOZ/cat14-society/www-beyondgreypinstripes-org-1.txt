Influencing Business Education
Our work in management education is grounded in the belief that business school faculty — through their teaching, research and consulting — are powerful actors in setting the tone on Wall Street and in firms around the globe. Thus, our overarching objective is to build the vanguard of faculty who, through their teaching, will prepare our next generation of business leaders to more fully align business activities with the long-term health of society.
