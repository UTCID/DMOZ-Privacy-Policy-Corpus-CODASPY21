Privacy Policy
Statement of Policy on Privacy Sigma Chi’s member privacy policy is provided to help members understand how the Fraternity protects their privacy. This policy provides you with an opportunity to make informed choices about the management of your personal information. Call Headquarters at (847) 869-3655 or visit SIGMACHI.ORG for more information. If you have already instructed us how to implement your choices under the Sigma Chi Privacy Policy, you do not need to contact us again. We will continue to honor the choices you have made. Policy on the Collection, Use and Sharing of Private InformationSigma Chi has one privacy policy for consumers that applies to all Sigma Chi entities operating from the Sigma Chi International Headquarters at 1714 Hinman Avenue, Evanston, Ill. This includes the Sigma Chi Fraternity, the Sigma Chi Corporation, the Sigma Chi Foundation, Constantine Capital Inc., the Risk Management Foundation, Sigma Chi Leadership Institute, Blue and Gold Travel Services of Illinois, and Constantine Housing Initiative. It is our belief that one privacy policy makes it easy to understand and convenient for our members to make informed choices about the management of their personal information. Information covered by this policyOur policy applies to all personally identifiable information about you that is obtained by Sigma Chi in connection with your member records (personal information). Our policy will continue to cover information we may collect about you during the course of your membership in Sigma Chi. How we collect personal informationSigma Chi relies upon many sources of information to understand and meet your needs. We collect personal information about you from: Pledgeship application and membership records submitted by you or on your behalfOther ways when you communicate with us in person, over the phone, through the mail or through our Web siteChapter, undergraduate and alumni submissions;Governmental reporting agencies like the National Change of Address and U.S. Mail Federal agenciesInformation-sharing relationships that we establish with your institution of higher educationInformation provided to our vendors who respond to us to keep our information as correct as possibleWeb browsers, when you visit our Web site and your browser interacts with usOther sources in connection with providing you a product or service How we keep information secureInformation security is one of our highest priorities. This priority is emphasized by our Sigma Chi Fraternity Governing Laws, specifically prohibition on solicitation, this Privacy Policy, and the contracts and agreements that we sign with external vendors, suppliers and licensees. We limit access to personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide services to you. Employees who violate our policies and procedures regarding privacy are subject to disciplinary action; our vendors, suppliers and licensees are also bound to uphold our procedures regarding privacy under the terms of our legal contracts with them. We safeguard information by regularly assessing security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to personal information. Information sharing within Sigma Chi entities and your opportunity to opt outMembers often tell us that they prefer our current “integrated approach” to their membership relationship with Sigma Chi and our related entities. For this reason and others, we may share any of the personal information that we collect about you among the entities closely related and tied to Sigma Chi, including Sigma Chi Fraternity, Sigma Chi Corporation, Sigma Chi Foundation, Constantine Capital Inc., the Risk Management Foundation, Sigma Chi Leadership Institute, Blue and Gold Travel Services of Illinois, and Constantine Housing Initiative. If you prefer that we not share personal information about you with other entities within Sigma Chi as mentioned above, or with companies or entities outside Sigma Chi (except information described below under “Other Information Sharing”), you may opt out.
