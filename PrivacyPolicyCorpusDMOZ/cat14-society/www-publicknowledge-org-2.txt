Video: How Do We Move Beyond Consent Models in Privacy Legislation?
Consent Models, Online Privacy, Privacy, Privacy Legislation, Webinar Series
While everyone agrees that we need federal privacy legislation, how it should work is another story. Oftentimes legislation relies on companies getting consent before collecting, using, or selling data. Consent mechanisms place the burden on consumers to figure out what uses of data are beneficial or harmful.
In this webinar, we discussed why consent doesn’t protect consumers and proposed other frameworks that could be used in federal privacy legislation.
Keynote:
Senator Sherrod Brown
Speakers:
Yosef Getachew, Director for Media & Democracy Program at Common Cause
Nathalie Marechal, Senior Policy Analyst at Ranking Digital Rights
Stephanie Nguyen, Digital Rights Researcher at Consumer Reports
Joseph Turow, The Robert Lewis Shayon Professor at the University of Pennsylvania
Moderator: Sara Collins, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge
