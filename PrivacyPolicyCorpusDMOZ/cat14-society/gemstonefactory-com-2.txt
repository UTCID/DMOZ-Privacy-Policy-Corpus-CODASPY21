Last Updated July 11, 2020Due to the unique nature of the products offered many items on the site do not come in one standard size.  Items will have size ranges and price will vary according to size and weight. Where there is a range of sizes listed the price quoted is a guideline intended to aid you in your selection.  The actual price of the item picked for you will depend on the specific item chosen.  For example labradorite spheres are offered from 50 to 60mm and the prices in this size range will run from $9.00 to $15.00.  The site lists the price as an average of $12.50  but the specific sphere chosen can be anywhere in this range.     An invoice will be generated as you choose the items you would like to purchase.  The merchandise total shown when you have completed your order is a close estimate.  The exact merchandise cost cannot be calculated until the entire order is pulled.  In addition, the unique nature of our products does not allow us to calculate shipping costs until your exact items are pulled and packed.   Shipping and Handling fees will be added to every order placed.  Once we have the exact cost of your merchandise and have added the correct shipping costs your order will be charged and shipped.  You will receive an email copy of your invoice after your credit card has been charged.  Please see Delivery section for detailed shipping information. Wholesale to the trade only...The state of Florida requires that we maintain a hard copy of each customers resale certificate (not an EIN number).
