Use of Cookies
The RZIM websites use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize RZIM pages, or register with RZIM’s site or services, a cookie helps RZIM to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same RZIM website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the RZIM features that you customized.
You can accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the RZIM services or websites you visit.
Security of Your Personal Information
RZIM secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. RZIM secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while this website strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once this website receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
Children’s Online Privacy
We are concerned about the privacy of young children, and we do not collect any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to enable them to participate in the activities we offer on our sites. RZIM will not knowingly collect or preserve data from children under 16 years of age. We encourage you to become involved with your child’s Internet activities and their access to our site, to ensure that his or her privacy is well protected. To read more about online safety and how to become more involved with your child’s online experience, visit OnGuardOnline.gov.
Updating Your Personal Information
It is important that the information contained in our records is both accurate and current. If your personal information happens to change during our relationship, please keep us informed of such changes. In some circumstances, we may not agree with your request to change your personal information and will instead append an alternative text to the record in question.
Changes to this Statement
RZIM will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect your feedback. RZIM encourages you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how RZIM is protecting your information.
