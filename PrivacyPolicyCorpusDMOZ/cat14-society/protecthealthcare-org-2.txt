In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”), the Coalition has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and the Coalition follows the notice and take-down procedures of the DMCA.

NOTE: This contact information is for notices or complaints regarding potential copyright and other infringement only.
We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers.
It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.
The Coalition will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third-party complaint of alleged infringement of the third party’s intellectual property rights.

You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date as of which the Terms have changed, the Coalition will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.
18. Miscellaneous

The Terms, and all other aspects of use of the Services, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. All claims and disputes arising out of the Terms, the Privacy Policy, or use of the Services, other than an action for specific performance or injunctive relief brought by the Coalition, shall be exclusively brought in the federal, state or local courts located in the District of Columbia; and with regard to such claims and disputes, Users hereby irrevocably (i) submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over them by these courts, and (ii) waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.
If any provision of the Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The User may not assign, transfer, or otherwise convey any rights granted hereunder; provided that, the Coalition may assign any of the foregoing without prior written consent.
