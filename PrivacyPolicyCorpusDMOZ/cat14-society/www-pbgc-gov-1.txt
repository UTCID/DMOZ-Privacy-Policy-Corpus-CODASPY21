Privacy @ PBGCEspañol
Welcome to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Privacy web page.  The Privacy Program is responsible for the development and maintenance of privacy policies and guidance for PBGC.
Read PBGC's Privacy Strategic Plan.
Participant Privacy Act Notice
The Participant Privacy Act Notice describes the information that PBGC collects from its participants and how that information is used.
Online Privacy
The Online Privacy page contains information about cookies, the transmission and storage of personal information that is collected by PBGC’s websites and programs, and the collection and storage of non-personal information by PBGC.
System of Records Notices
A System of Records Notice, or SORN, informs the public of the existence of a system of records and describes the type of information collected, why it is being collected, what it may be used for, when it may be disclosed to third parties, how it will be safeguarded, and how and when it will be destroyed.
Privacy Impact Assessments
A Privacy Impact Assessment, or PIA, is an analysis of the privacy impact of a substantially revised or new Information Technology System.
Make a Privacy Act Request
The Privacy Act permits you to access records about yourself that are maintained by PBGC in a Privacy Act system of records.  In addition, you may request that incorrect or incomplete information be changed or amended.
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that gives the public the right to request federal agency records. All federal agencies, including PBGC, are required to make requested records available unless the records are protected from disclosure by an exemption.
The PBGC Implementing Regulations for the FOIA (29 CFR 4901) and the Privacy Act (29 CFR 4902) document the internal rules and procedures followed by the PBGC in implementing to two acts.
