Legal Project Management
Hicksons’ medical negligence team is able to take clients through complex medico-legal matters, bringing in the significant clinical experience of many of our team members and our expertise in managing catastrophic, high profile and politically sensitive claims.
We act on behalf of health providers, facilities and services throughout NSW and provide prompt, authoritative and appropriate legal advice across a broad range of matters, whether straightforward, novel, highly contentious, catastrophic or complex.
Our lawyers have a thorough understanding of medical terminology, a wide range of clinical conditions, clinical notes, policies, hospital processes and functions.
We have expertise to handle the escalation in the number and cost of nervous shock or mental harm claims, those arising from alleged breaches of consumer laws, investigations and actions against health care practitioners because of increasing complains to the Health Care Complaints Commission and the use by consumers of social media platforms to place pressure on defendants to resolve claims.
