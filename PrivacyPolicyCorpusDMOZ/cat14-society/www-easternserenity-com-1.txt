We occasionally make portions of our customer transaction information available to selected organizations; if you wish to opt out of these exchanges or unsubscribe from our catalog or newsletter mailings please call us or use the following link. We will only send you a non-confirmation/shipping email if you opt-in to our newsletter program, although on rare occasions we will offer past customers a chance to subscribe again as we update our systems and procedures. We never share email addresses or telephone numbers with outside organizations.
Our website and phone center does not collect, store or process credit card information directly; we use secure encrypted servers at verisign and therefore have no access to your credit card information after we process your order on these third party servers.
We also send our catalogs to rental lists from other organizations. If you have never contacted us before and no longer wish to receive our catalogs, the best way to remove your name from every shared list is to contact the Direct Marketing Association at the following web link: www.dmachoice.org
