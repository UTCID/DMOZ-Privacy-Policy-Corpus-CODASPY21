Teachers.Net Information...
Teachers.Net was founded in 1995 by San Diego teacher Anthony Bott, who recognized the challenge and opportunity emerging technology posed for educators.
He founded Teachers.Net to help teachers harness the brand new World Wide Web and related technologies, and for the last two decades he's worked to further that mission, and keep teachers abreast of the rapidly evolving technology front.
Read about Teachers.Net's humble beginnings in Tony's own words in this article in the Teachers.Net Gazette, published in October 2013.
