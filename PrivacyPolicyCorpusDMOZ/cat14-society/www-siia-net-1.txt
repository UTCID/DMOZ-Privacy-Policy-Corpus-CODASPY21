Privacy Policy & User Agreement
The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) respects the privacy of visitors to its website, event registrants, newsletter and listserv subscribers, member companies and other SIIA customers and users.  This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from these users and how we use, disclose and protect it. Most personal information we obtain is provided voluntarily by the data subject in conjunction with our Association’s activities: we put on events, transmit publications and facilitate member discussions and networking, protect our members’ intellectual property, and engage in advocacy for the technology and content industries.
Please read this policy thoroughly to ensure that you understand the circumstances under which SIIA collects and uses information and when SIIA may disclose such information to third parties.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Information Collected From Users of the SIIA Website.  Users to the public areas of SIIA’s website generally browse anonymously.  We do not normally attempt to identify website visitors without a security-related reason.  SIIA uses a third-party service to collect and report aggregate and anonymized data, such as number of page views, unique visitors, frequency of visits, and other visitor traffic metrics.  SIIA collects the IP address of those who report piracy to SIIA on the site in order to help SIIA staff judge the reliability of the report.  SIIA will also occasionally collect an IP address when accepting credit card information online to detect duplicate credit card transaction submissions or cases of fraud and to identify organizations that may be interested in sponsoring or otherwise partnering with SIIA on one or more SIIA events.
We use cookies (small text files downloaded from our site to your device) in the following ways.
Necessary Cookies.  These cookies enable you to move around the website and are intended to make that experience easier—for example, by customizing content to the kind of device you use.
Use Cookies.  These cookies tell us how you use the site—what links you click on, and how long you stay on a page.  Unless you have logged in using a password, this information is anonymized.  It tells us which pages our users have engaged with the most, and how visitors use the site.  These cookies help us improve the content on the site and the way that the site functions.
Our server logs collect standard information about how our site is used, such as IP addresses, time and date of visit, and the address of the website you came from before you got to ours.  This information is anonymized.  SIIA does not track your behavior once you leave our website.  We also do not sell or rent your personal information.
Information Collected From SIIA Members, Event Registrants, Newsletter Subscribers, Award Nominees and Other Customers. SIIA asks some users to voluntarily provide some limited information, such as name, job title, company, business address, business phone, fax , e-mail, and, in cases where a payment to SIIA is required, credit card account information. This information may be submitted to SIIA through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, subscriptions, contest registrations or other SIIA forms. Whenever we transfer your personal information to a third party, we have contract clauses that provide for appropriate security to protect your privacy.
SIIA may also use unique identifiers in emails sent to SIIA members, event registrants, award nominees, newsletter subscribers and other customers to help SIIA understand which emails have been opened and if so, how many times. SIIA may also use custom URLs in these emails to track how many times recipients clicked on the URLs in an email message. We use this information to improve the quality and accuracy of our email campaigns.
USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Use of Data Collected From Users of the SIIA Website. We use data collected about users of the SIIA website only for internal and marketing purposes. We do not retain any personally identifying information. On occasion, SIIA may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available. Any information that users voluntarily disclose in these areas may be publicly accessible. SIIA does not routinely monitor these activities and users should exercise caution when sharing personal information.
Use of Information Collected From SIIA Members, Event Registrants, Newsletter Subscribers, Award Nominees and Other Customers. SIIA uses the data it collects from SIIA members, event registrants, newsletter subscribers, award nominees and other customers to perform activities related to: (i) identifying SIIA members and administering user accounts; (ii) fulfilling orders, sending newsletters, managing conferences; (iii) developing and improving the products and services offered by SIIA; and (iv) contacting members and other customers with information about SIIA products, services, promotions or special offers, unless they have indicated that they do not want to be contacted. Anyone may choose to withdraw their consent by following the procedure within the footer of any SIIA email communications.  Alternatively, anyone may email SIIA at privacy@siia.net with a request to withdraw consent from all or any specific SIIA communications
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties. SIIA makes member company product information and contact information available to certain users of the SIIA website and to those who register for SIIA events. SIIA may also share data with event sponsors who may want to send SIIA event registrants information about their products or services. SIIA requires these third parties to maintain, use, and disclose any information provided by SIIA in a manner consistent with this policy.
Disclosure to SIIA Contractors. SIIA employs contractors to assist with administrative and other de rigueur functions and may provide contractors with access to data. Contractors include lawyers, auditors, and other service providers. So long as we have your information, you cannot withdraw consent for disclosures to SIIA contractors. SIIA requires its contractors who have access to maintain appropriate security and to maintain, use, and disclose any personal information provided by SIIA in a manner consistent with this policy.
Individuals May Withdraw Consent At Any Time: Individuals may request SIIA to stop third party disclosures by indicating their preferences on their SIIA member account profile or when registering for an SIIA event or other instance in which they are providing contact information to SIIA. On a conference-by-conference basis registrants will be also be given the opportunity to express their preferences whether to allow SIIA to share their contact information with other registrants, conference sponsors and other third parties. At any other time, individuals who do not want SIIA to share their contact information with third parties should log into their account profile to indicate their preferences.  If you want to delete your information from our databases, contact SIIA directly at privacy@siia.net or (202) 289-7442 to request that their information be deleted.
Use of Credit Card Account Information. SIIA uses a third-party payment processor. SIIA does not store or disclose credit card account information provided by its members and customers.
Reporting Piracy to SIIA. Anyone can voluntarily report possible incidents of software piracy and content piracy to SIIA through SIIA's online piracy reporting forms, email or hotline. SIIA uses this information to investigate piracy claims and, if necessary, to take legal and/or other enforcement action. All information identifying individuals who report software piracy or content piracy is kept strictly confidential by SIIA staff and outside counsel and is not disclosed unless required by law or expressly allowed by the individual who reported the piracy.
Other Disclosures. SIIA does not generally disclose personal information except as described here. However, in response to legal process, or in the event that we believe that our website has been hacked or we find evidence suggesting improper or criminal activity, we reserve the right to share information with law enforcement and others to protect our rights and property. We may also make disclosures to take precautions against liability or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety.
Business transfers.  If we sell the business, we will require that the purchaser will abide by this privacy policy, either now or as it may be amended from time to time.  We reserve the right to transfer your personal information if we are bought by another firm.  Information that we acquire from a purchased business will be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.

SIIA stores all information it collects on servers accessible only by SIIA employees and contractors. We use reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss, and destruction; maintain data accuracy; and ensure correct use of information. Account information and profiles are password-protected. We recommend that SIIA members and any others with password-protected access to the SIIA website not divulge their password to anyone and take adequate precautions to ensure that their password is not accessible to third parties.
