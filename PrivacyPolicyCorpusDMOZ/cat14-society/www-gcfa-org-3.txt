If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Site.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, effective upon the date we post the new Privacy Policy to the Site. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your binding acceptance of the Privacy Policy, including any changes or modifications that we may make, and to GCFA’s collection and sharing of your PII and other certain information in accordance with the terms of the then current Privacy Policy.

Our web server collects and stores the following information about you: the date and time of your visit; where you go in our sites; the type of operating system and browser you use; the search engine and key words used that brought you to one of our sites; and the location of a visitor’s machine. This information is collected automatically. We solely use it to improve our websites by tracking the number of “hits” or visits to our sites, the most popular times of day and sections visited, and the range of computers and browsers most commonly used to view it. GCFA does not sell or transmit any of this information to other parties or organizations.
We may use “cookies,” which are small files stored on your computer’s hard drive that are used to store and track information about users. Cookies are used to remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Site pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.
GCFA may also collect Internet protocol addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there.

There may be instances when we may access or disclose your information in order to protect or defend the legal rights or property of GCFA and its affiliated companies or their employees and agents, to protect the safety and security of users, and to protect against fraud. We may also access or disclose your information to comply with a court order or other legal process, enforce our Terms of Service, or respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties.
