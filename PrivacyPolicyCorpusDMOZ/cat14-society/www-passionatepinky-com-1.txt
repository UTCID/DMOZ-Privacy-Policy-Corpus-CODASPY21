* Do you know what the Wildcard record is?
Suggested article: What is Wildcard record?
The Wildcard DNS record is a record that answers DNS requests for subdomains you haven't already defined. It is specified by using a "*" as the leftmost label (part) of a domain name, e.g., *.example.com.
* When you set a wildcard record, that record does not override any existing subdomain records in the zone.
How to add a Wildcard record?
Wildcard Record is useful when you wish to redirect all visitors to your website regardless of what subdomain they access your website through. This is also useful when someone mistypes www, for example, and writes ww.example.com.
