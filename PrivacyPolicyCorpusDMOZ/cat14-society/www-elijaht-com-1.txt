Cybersecurity & Data Privacy
ELIJAH understands cybersecurity and data privacy challenges because we live them every day.
For years, ELIJAH has been providing expert cybersecurity solutions to our clients. We offer proactive data security solutions, such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, social engineering, and cybersecurity managed services, as well as data privacy consulting services. We also are able to quickly react when clients have been hacked, offering expert incident response services. When it comes to cybersecurity, our motto is simple: Open the Door to ELIJAH, Close the Door to Hackers.
ELIJAH also has developed a specialty offering in cybersecurity M&A due diligence, helping clients on the buy-side evaluate potential cybersecurity risks in a merger or acquisition, and helping clients on the sell-side maximize their cybersecurity readiness in preparation for potentially being acquired. Assessing cybersecurity risks can be as important in evaluating the deal value and terms as more commonly investigated factors, such as the quality of earnings, customers, and employees. Properly performed cybersecurity due diligence can help minimize risk, reduce costs, and identify potential deal-breakers, and ELIJAH is well-positioned to assist clients with these needs.
