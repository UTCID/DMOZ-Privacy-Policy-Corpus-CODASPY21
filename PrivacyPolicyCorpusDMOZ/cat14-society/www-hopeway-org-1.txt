Notice of Privacy Practices FAQs
What is the HIPAA notice I receive from HopeWay?
HopeWay is required to provide you with a notice that tells you how we may use and share your health information. It must also include your health privacy rights. In most cases, you should receive the notice on your first visit to a HopeWay. You can also ask for a copy at any time.
Why do I have to sign a form?
The law requires HopeWay to ask you to state in writing that you received the notice. However, the law does not require you to sign the “acknowledgement of receipt of the notice.” Signing does not mean that you have agreed to any special uses or disclosures (sharing) of your health records. Refusing to sign the acknowledgement does not prevent HopeWay from using or disclosing health information as HIPAA permits. If you refuse to sign the acknowledgement, HopeWay must keep a record of this fact.
What is in the Notice?
The notice describes how the Privacy Rule allows HopeWay to use and disclose protected health information. It also explains that:
Your permission (authorization) is necessary before your health records are shared for any other reason,
HopeWay’s duties to protect health information privacy,
Your privacy rights, including the right to complain to HHS and to HopeWay if you believe your privacy rights have been violated, and
How to contact HopeWay for more information and to make a complaint.
When and how can I receive a Notice of Privacy Practices?
You’ll usually receive notice at your first appointment. The notice is also posted in a clear and easy to find location in the Hopeway lobby where clients are able to see it, and a copy must be provided to anyone who asks for one. Additionally, the notice is available for review on the link below.
