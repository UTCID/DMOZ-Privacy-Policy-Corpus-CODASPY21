What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information
Our mailing list subscription, contact, registration and donation forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. text), address, interests, and similar information. We know that many of our visitors and site users have ongoing concerns about their addresses or other personal information being sold to or shared with third parties. Please be assured that we do not and will not share, sell or rent anyone’s information with other organizations or individuals. We do not request or store sensitive information such as credit card or social security numbers from our website visitors unless payment for a donation or registration for an event is required. Please see “Financial Transactions” below for more information.
Internet Protocol Address
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our website, analyze trends, track users’ movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Use of “Cookies”
Our website may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our website. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. Use of cookies makes web surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular website and to make sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.
Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our website will not function properly when you view them.
Financial Transactions
To process donations and registration payments for events and classes, it is necessary to provide DHA with your credit card information for processing and billing. Your information is collected and transferred over the Internet securely. The credit card information that you provide to us is used only for the transaction(s) you request and will not be used for any other purpose. We use a cloud-based service from Bloomerang to allow us to manage and process all transactions and associated data. Please view Bloomerang’s Security Policy for further information.
Security
All information provided to DHA through our website is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us, making your connection to our website secure. Our SSL certificate is served through and verified by GoDaddy.com, Inc. (learn how). However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.
