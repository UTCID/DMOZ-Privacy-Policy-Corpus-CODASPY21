Privacy Policy:The Christian Center ("The Christian Center") operates thechristian-center.org and may operate other websites. It is The Christian Center's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, The Christian Center collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Christian Center's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The Christian Center's visitors use its website. From time to time, The Christian Center may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
The Christian Center also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on thechristian-center.org blogs/sites. The Christian Center only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to The Christian Center's websites choose to interact with The Christian Center in ways that require The Christian Center to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The Christian Center gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
at thechristian-center.org to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with The Christian Center are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, The Christian Center collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with The Christian Center. The Christian Center does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
The Christian Center may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. The Christian Center may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, The Christian Center does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using The Christian Center's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
