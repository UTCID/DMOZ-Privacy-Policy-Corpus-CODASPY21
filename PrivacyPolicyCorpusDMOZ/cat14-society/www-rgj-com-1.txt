VOICESOpinion | Despite legal victory, tribes still a target in water warsDelaine SpilsburyView Comments Subscribe:Read local news and views with a 99-cent subscription to RGJ.comThis opinion column was submitted by Delaine Spilsbury, an Ely Shoshone tribal elder, former member of the Nevada Commission on Tourism, and Board Member of the Great Basin Heritage Area and Great Basin Water Network.As longtime opponents of the Las Vegas pipeline, tribal members and governments were relieved after the state and Southern Nevada Water Authority decided not to appeal a district court ruling that dealt a major blow to the $15.5 billion, 300-mile groundwater mining proposal.The news is a victory for Native Americans like me. But it is important to underscore that tribal and natural interests are still at risk.We know that the effort to protect water in rural valleys will not cede because this district court ruling. There is still work to do and long-term threats to our way of life and our spiritual and cultural identity.The Duckwater Shoshone, Ely Shoshone and Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation helped lead the anti-pipeline fight for more than 30 years alongside White Pine County, the Great Basin Water Network and the LDS Church.More:UPDATED: District court judge deals blow to Las Vegas pipeline planUnder a lens, it’s easy to see why tribal leaders, elders and activists still have grave concerns about the future of our water supply and, therefore, the future of native people in Nevada.SNWA still maintains applications to pump more than 35 billion gallons of water annually out of Railroad Valley, home to the Duckwater Shoshone.SNWA still maintains applications to pump 16 billion gallons annually out of Snake Valley, home to Great Basin National Park and many traditional cultural sites for my people — including the site of Snake Creek Burial Cave.SNWA has rights and applications for some 9 billion gallons in valleys that are vital for Death Valley National Park and the Timbisha Shoshone.Next, a sacred tribal site that was at the center of our court victory still remains unprotected from SNWA and future threats. The location, known by my Newe ancestors as Bahsahwahbee, is the equivalent to Vatican City for Catholics or Mecca for Muslims. The site was home to at least three massacres of my ancestors. Shallow-rooted trees that grow there, known locally as swamp cedars, are home to the souls of the native lives lost.More:Her people were massacred in 1897. Today, she's tells the story about her connection to itThe site could easily be jeopardized by another attempt at a water grab or excessive groundwater pumping in the vicinity.The site is also still intricately intertwined with SNWA — whose giant ranching operation spanning 900,000 acres borders this site and reminds us that the Water Authority is not leaving rural Nevada anytime soon.Lastly, a right-of-way application with the BLM remains for the pipeline along with an agreement that silences federal agencies like the Bureau of Indian Affairs from acting to protect tribal interests.If history is any indicator, we are prepared to expect the worst.For more than 30 years, SNWA ignored Tribal concerns about our sacred sites, traditional ways and spiritual beliefs. They failed to properly consult our leaders. They publicly mocked us.During one legal proceeding our spiritual beliefs were cravenly cast by a SNWA attorney as akin to believing in the boogeyman. Another SNWA official compared tribal leaders to children.More:Las Vegas water pipeline battle is life-or-death fight for Shoshone sacred siteWe were told not to worry about the potential dust storms, wildlife loss, vegetation desecration and the overwhelming dearth of water. However, our firsthand knowledge of what the Los Angeles Water Grab did to our relatives in Owens Valley gave us a totally different view.Special places like Bahsahwahbee are inherently ingrained into the fabric of our existence as indigenous people to these lands. If a water-dependent place like Bahsahwahbee is harmed, it limits our ability to connect spiritually with the creator.Some of our opponents describe us as an implacable bulwark to progress. In response, we ask how would you feel if someone burned down your church or desecrated your family’s burial sites?For native communities, the fight to protect our identity spans beyond the water wars with Southern Nevada.Across the state, indigenous leaders and advocates are mobilizing to defend what’s essential to all life for generations to come. The military land grabs adjacent to Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge and on the Desert National Wildlife Refuge, mining proposals at Long Canyon, the toxic waste dump at Yucca Mountain, the poisoned water in Yerington, and the water shortage at Walker Lake are a few examples where tribes are leading the fight.More:Congress must reject Navy's expansion of NAS Fallon bombing range | GeorgeWe have no other choice but to continue our efforts.Native communities want to remain part of natural Nevada. If companies and governments extirpate the land, water, and life from here, they will eliminate the core of who we are.Have your say:How to submit an opinion column or letter to the editorView Comments
