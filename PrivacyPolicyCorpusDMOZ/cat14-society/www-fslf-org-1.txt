Sexual Abuse of Minors and Vulnerable Adults
for Members of the Franciscan Sisters of Little Falls, Minnesota.
As followers of the Gospel, we strongly assert that sexual abuse of minors and vulnerable adults by any member of the Franciscan Sisters of Little Falls is contrary to our Franciscan mission and values, to Christian principles, and is a violation of civil and criminal law.
We feel deep sadness for the devastating pain and betrayal of trust that is caused by sexual abuse by a member of a religious community. We seek to find healing for all victims of abuse and their families.
We are committed to listening with care and pastoral concern to any allegation brought forth of sexual abuse by a member of our Franciscan Community. We will take any allegation seriously and we will act with a high level of Christian care and concern as we investigate and resolve the issue. Our goal is to provide healing for all persons affected through a respectful and mutual process of reconciliation.
We will respond to any allegations that come to us directly from a complainant or through a diocesan victim's advocate or a licensed professional retained by the complainant.
We have published our policy on Sexual Abuse of Minors and Vulnerable Adults so that healing for individuals and relationships may occur. Any contact will be handled with the confidentiality consistent with our obligations to address any violations of our policy.

The Franciscan Sisters of Little Falls, Minnesota, is a community of Catholic women religious who follow the Gospel of Jesus Christ, walking in the footsteps of Saints Francis and Clare of Assisi. We believe that the living of a poor, simple and prayerful community life is a ministry of presence and witness. Our doors are open to the public to celebrate Mass in Sacred Heart Chapel and to benefit from the St. Francis Music Center and St. Francis Health & Recreation Center. We welcome those who wish to join us as sisters, associates, volunteers, transfer sisters, friends and donors.
