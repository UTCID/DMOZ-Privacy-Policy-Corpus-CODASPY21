Membership, Free Trials, Pay-Per-View, Billing and Cancellation
Membership
Ongoing Membership. Your Kabbalah.com membership, which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to-month unless and until you cancel your membership or the Centre terminates it. You must have Internet access and provide a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the Kabbalah service. The Centre will bill the monthly membership fee to your Payment Method. If you desire to cancel your membership, you must cancel your membership before it renews for the next month in order to avoid billing and payment for the next month's membership fees by your registered Payment Method.
Differing Memberships. The Centre may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships with differing conditions and limitations. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your membership with Kabbalah.com by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link. Some promotional memberships are offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. The Centre is not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered membership plans.
Free Trials. Your Kabbalah membership may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for 7 days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. Free trials may not be combined with any other offers. Free trials are for new and certain former members only. The Centre reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.
The Centre will begin billing your Payment Method for its monthly membership fees at the end of the free trial period of your membership unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your membership, including monthly membership price and end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click the "View billing details" link on the "Your Account" The Centre may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period.
You will receive an email notice from the Centre that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun. You may cancel your free trial by either (1) logging into your Kabbalah membership account, choosing to "edit" your subscription under "Membership Subscription" and clicking on the "cancel" option; or (2) calling 424-332-5381 or 1-888-898-8358 to cancel your subscription. The Centre will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel.
Pay-Per-View Purchasing Pay-Per-View streaming event. You may order Kabbalah pay-per-view Services by calling 424-332-5381 or 1-888-898-8358 or by visiting Kabbalah.com/event, or by speaking with a live operator via live chat.
Billing
Recurring Billing. By starting your Kabbalah membership, you authorize the Centre to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Kabbalah service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers and/or changing or adding a plan or service, and you authorize the Centre to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges.
Price Changes. The Centre reserves the right to adjust pricing for its service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as it may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.
Billing Cycle. The membership fee for our Kabbalah service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. The Centre automatically bills your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Kabbalah membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership. Visit our website and click on the "View billing details" link on the "Your Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. The Centre may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly refers to your billing cycle.
No Refunds. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, the Centre may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at the Centre’s sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate the Centre to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link, available at the top of the pages of the Kabbalah website. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
Cancellation. You may cancel your Kabbalah membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Kabbalah service through the end of your monthly billing period. THE CENTRE DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS OR UNWATCHED video content. To cancel, go to the "Your Account" page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation.
Pre-Paid Discounts. If you subscribed to the Services pursuant to a special offer granting a pre-paid discount for a fixed number of months, your pre-paid fees are payable in advance and are COMPLETELY NON-REFUNDABLE. In addition, your initial monthly service fee for the month immediately following your pre-paid period will be PRE-AUTHORIZED AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD LIMIT and will be immediately charged to your credit or debit card, without further authorization from you, upon the expiration of such pre-paid period, unless you provide prior notice (in accordance with the Centre's verification procedures, as may be established by the Centre from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization in accordance with these terms and conditions. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before the Centre reasonably could act on your notice.
Notification of Changed Billing Information. You must promptly notify the Centre of changes to: (a) the account number, security code or expiration date of your designated credit or debit cards; (b) your billing address for the designated credit or debit card. You must also promptly notify the Centre if your card is canceled for any reason, including loss or theft. In order to avoid Services interruptions caused by rejected credit or debit card charges, the Centre reserves the right to update your credit or debit card details (such as expiration dates or new card numbers). You understand and agree that the Centre is entitled to obtain such updated card details, store them and use them to bill charges.
Passwords & Account Access
The member who created the Kabbalah account and whose Payment Method is charged should be the same person and is referred to here as the Account Owner. The Account Owner has access and control over the Kabbalah account. The Account Owner's control is exercised through use of the Account Owner's password and therefore to maintain exclusive control, the Account Owner should not reveal the password to anyone. In addition, if the Account Owner wishes to prohibit others from contacting Kabbalah Customer Service and potentially altering the Account Owner's control, the Account Owner should not reveal the Payment Method details (e.g., last four digits of their credit or debit card, or their email address if they use PayPal) associated with their account. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the information you provide to the Centre relating to your account.
In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the Kabbalah service, the Centre implements technology that enables it to recognize you as the Account Owner and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Kabbalah service, which includes accessing via Kabbalah ready devices or website.
BY SHARING THE KABBALAH SERVICE PASSWORD OR ALLOWING OTHERS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT, THE ACCOUNT OWNER AGREES TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSURING THAT HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF USE AND SUCH ACCOUNT OWNER SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS.
You should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other account information. Providing your information in response to these types of communications can result in identity theft. Always access your sensitive account information by going directly to the Centre website and not through a hyperlink in an email or any other electronic communication, even if it looks official. The Centre reserves the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the member in order to protect itself and its partners from what it believes to be fraudulent activity. The Centre is not obligated to credit or discount a membership for holds placed on the account by either a representative of the Centre or by the automated processes of the Centre.
