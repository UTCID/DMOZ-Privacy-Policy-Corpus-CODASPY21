About
When Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home opened in 1979, it was the first funeral home in New Orleans, Louisiana to be built on the grounds of a cemetery. As sister locations, Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home, Metairie Cemetery and Lake Lawn Park Cemetery offer families an unparalleled convenience and peace of mind.
As a
member of the Dignity Memorial® network of funeral, cremation and cemetery service providers, all of our services are designed to help you through one of the most personal and challenging stages of life. We understand that losing a loved one is an emotional and difficult experience, and are committed to providing compassionate care and professional and personal service.
Convenient New Orleans funeral home
Our funeral home includes 9 visitation rooms, 2 chapels that each has the ability to seat more than 300 people, coffee lounges and a private reception room. Accommodating services of all denominations, we create ceremonies as simple, elaborate, traditional or unique as you wish.
Our goal is to provide personalized, compassionate care that exceeds expectations. With more than 250 years of experience, the staff of Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home consists of caring professionals who understand that each family is unique and has personal requests and traditions. Our vast experience coupled with this understanding and sensitivity toward the needs of the families we serve allows us to go above and beyond throughout the entire process.
Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home, our on-site crematory, Metairie Cemetery, Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum, and our proximity to many metro churches
gives New Orleans families the ultimate convenience, security and peace of mind when planning a funeral, cremation, memorial service or burial.
On-site crematory
Our state-of-the-art crematory is located within Metairie Cemetery. This allows an extra level of convenience for families who choose cremation. The private witness/viewing room provides families with the opportunity to take a very personal approach to their loved one’s final arrangements.
Metairie Cemetery
All cemeteries tell a story. The story written by Metairie Cemetery has a long and distinguished genealogy.  The land has been touched by many of the events and figures that have made the history of New Orleans so fascinating. Established in 1872, Metairie Cemetery is a historic 127-acre premier cemetery. The area was previously known as the Metairie Race Course, whose oval racetrack is still present on the grounds.
With breathtaking memorials, intricate marble tombs and incredibly detailed stained glass and statues, it is the resting place of many past governors, mayors, military leaders and countless men and women of the business, cultural, political and social life of New Orleans.
Metairie Cemetery was entered in the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. In 2003, Forbes named Metairie Cemetery Association one of the 10 Most Interesting Cemeteries in the World for its unique historical significance and beauty. This honor is a reflection of a deep commitment to preserve the memories of those entrusted to our care.
Tranquil Oaks Cremation Garden
Meticulously designed with your family's needs in mind, the extraordinary Tranquil Oaks Cremation Garden at Metairie Cemetery is filled with remembrance options including family estates, personalized granite pedestals, benches and other unique options. Serene walkways complemented by lush landscaping and beautiful water features lead visitors on a calm and inspirational journey as they remember the life of a loved one or plan in advance of the time of need.
Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum
Adjacent to Metairie Cemetery and established in 1949 is Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum, a 25-acre property offering a spectrum of final resting options to the New Orleans community. Lake Lawn Park offers in-ground burials, above-ground tombs, garden mausoleums and cremation options.
All Saints Mausoleum
All Saints Mausoleum, in cooperation with the New Orleans Archdiocese, was created to provide a modern and climate controlled Catholic burial facility in New Orleans. This unique mausoleum was dedicated on All Saints' Day, Nov. 1, 1986. The quiet elegance and spiritual beauty are hallmarks of this mausoleum. With stained-glass windows and Italian handcrafted mosaics, All Saints Mausoleum has become a renowned resting place for many New Orleanians.
Heaven’s Pets
On the grounds of Metairie Cemetery sits Heaven's Pets which provides total pet death care, cremation and bereavement services. The facility opened in April 2006. However, Heaven’s Pets was originally started in 2002 by veterinarian Dr. Brian Melius and his wife, Jennifer. Their family has provided veterinary care to the New Orleans community for more than 50 years. Their veterinary expertise, along with their love of animals and concern for pet owners, led them to establish Heaven's Pets.
Heaven's Pets has its own personnel, vehicles and on-site crematory designed and used only for pet cremations. The facility also has professionals available 24 hours a day for emergencies.
Heaven's Pets features an arrangement room, a viewing room for remembrance services and an ossuary. Families are able to select from numerous personalized memorial options for their pets.
Community events
Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home, Metairie Cemetery, and Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum hold many community events throughout the year. Some of these events include an ecumenical Easter
service, a Run Through History (a 1-mile and 5K walk/run through
Metairie Cemetery), the Washington Artillery memorial service, the Louisiana Law Enforcement Officers memorial service and an
All Saints' Day mass. The funeral home also offers its facilities to the community for meetings, seminars and educational forums.

"Actually these comments are for both future customers AND for Lake Lawn to consider: - Simply inquire and get a written list of any and all additional charges that will be or may be charged after the pre-paid funeral expenses are settled.
I would have certainly appreciated a copy of such services complete with the cost I prepaid for, at the final arrangement meeting. I may have been given such a listing at the conclusion of the prepayment meeting but I could not locate it in my home. The additional cost were at the time unexpected, again probably due to my poor memory.
I think it would be wise of Lake Lawn to list the other expenses a person will likely encounter upon a spouses death, along with the purchasers initial by each expense as documentation that it was discussed at the prepayment meeting. I have no hard feelings about the additional expenses because I have a terrible memory, but I suspect I am not the only surviving spouse with a poor memory. - And lastly it's would have been wonderful to be reminded upon the FIRST viewing of the deceased, that I still had the option of a closed casket. We buried two loved ones at the same time. One loved one looked to be peacefully sleeping while my other love one was actually really hard to identify, looked VERY bad. In retrospect, had I been reminded by my funeral director upon FIRST seeing him (I was alone) I would have undoubtedly requested the casket to be closed. Again I hold no grudge but a gentle reminder would have made everything better. I accept that it was my error in not having the lid closed."
