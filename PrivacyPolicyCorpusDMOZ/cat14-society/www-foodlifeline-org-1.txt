Food Lifeline Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of Use
Food Lifeline appreciates your support and engagement. Your willingness to place trust in our organization is important, and we are dedicated to making the most of your generous donation. Food Lifeline is committed to your privacy and not only maintains strict customer privacy policies, but also ensures a safe environment when you make a donation. We are also proud to follow the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance Standards for Charitable Accountability.
Food Lifeline does not share your information. We will not take your personal information and sell, exchange, or rent it to any other organization or individual.
Any personal information you share with Food Lifeline is only handled by those individuals necessary to transact, fulfill, and/or account for donations.
It is up to the discretion of each donor as to whether or not they would like their names printed in Food Lifeline’s published reports.
What Information Does Food Lifeline Collect?
If you choose to make a donation, Food Lifeline asks for pertinent information to complete your transaction and/or inquiry, such as your name, business, address, phone, and email address.
Other information Food Lifeline collects when you visit the web site includes the number of individuals visiting the site and what pages are being viewed.
How Food Lifeline Uses the Information Collected
Food Lifeline may use your phone number to verify information about your gift, to personally thank you for your donation, or to invite you to a special event.
The personal information that Food Lifeline collects from you is used to fulfill your transaction and/or inquiry. This includes, a) fulfilling a donation request, from credit card verification to sending you a tax receipt; b) replying to inquiries about promotions, food drives, or employment; c) following-up on volunteer inquiries; d) making changes to personal information, per individual request; e) confirming a donation request; f) to personally thank you; g) to send you additional Food Lifeline materials, by request; g) to protect the security and integrity of the site; h) to protect against a threat of safety or property damage; i) to protect against legal liability.
Regarding credit card donations, Food Lifeline works with several designated credit card companies. To fulfill these transactions, it is necessary that the third party has your correct name, business (if applicable), address, credit card number, and expiration date. The third-party entity’s firewalls and encryption technology are state-of-the-art and provide the highest levels of security to ensure the confidentiality of your transaction.
For Food Lifeline monthly donors making recurring electronic donations with a credit card or bank account, Food Lifeline works with a third party to enact automatic deductions from your credit card or bank account, per your authorization and specifications. If your information changes, it is important that you contact us at give@foodlifeline.org or via telephone at (206) 545-6600 with updates.
To reiterate, Food Lifeline will not use your personal information in any other way than what is stated in the Privacy Policy. Food Lifeline employees, agents, and contractors who have access to personal information are required to protect the data pursuant to the Privacy Policy.

When you make a donation to Food Lifeline, you can elect to have Food Lifeline publications or other pertinent information sent to you. If you want to make any changes to the material you receive, simply email Food Lifeline at give@foodlifeline.org.  You can also write to us at 815 South 96th Street, Seattle, WA 98108 or call (206) 545-6600.
Food Lifeline’s Secure Environment
Food Lifeline protects your online donation information by using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”). This technology works by encrypting the information you disclose to Food Lifeline during a donation transaction to prevent anyone other than Food Lifeline from decoding your personal information.
