GDPR where the processing of data becomes necessary for us, e.g. in the context of legal proceedings [in Germany, section 26 BDSG (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz  Federal Data Protection Act) applies additionally).The application process requires that applicants provide their details to us. Where we offer an online application form, the required applicant data is marked as mandatory, otherwise the required details will be indicated in the job descriptions and basically include the applicants personal details, postal and contact addresses and documents such as cover letter, CV, and certificates. In addition, applicants may provide us with additional information on an optional basis.By submitting their application to us, applicants consent to the processing of their data for the purposes of the application process in accordance with the nature and scope set forth in this privacy policy.Where special categories of personal data within the meaning of art. 9 (1) GDPR are voluntarily disclosed within the context of the application procedure, their processing is also carried out in accordance with art. 9 (2) lit. b GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severe disability status or ethnic origin).

The data will be encrypted and transmitted to us in accordance with the current state of technology.Applicants may also send us their applications by e-mail. However, please note that e-mails are not generally sent in encrypted form and that applicants themselves must ensure that their e-mails are encrypted.

Instead of applying via the online form and e-mail, applicants still have the option of sending their application by mail.In the event of a successful application, the data provided by applicants may be further processed by us for the purposes of the employment relationship. Otherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicant's data will be deleted.

GDPR, to process user information for the purpose of spam detection.On the same legal basis, in the case of surveys, we reserve the right to store users IP addresses for the duration of their use and to use cookies to avoid multiple votes.The data provided in the comments and contributions will permanently be stored by us until the user objects.CONTACTWhen contacting us (e.g. via contact form, e-mail, telephone or social media), we process information provided by the user to handle the contact inquiry pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 lit. b.

General information on the presentation of Facebook Ads is contained in Facebooks data usage policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy. For specific information and details about the Facebook pixel and how it works, visit the Facebook help section: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616 .You may opt out of Facebook pixel collection and the use of your information to display Facebook ads. To configure what types of ads you see within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions about the settings for usage-based ads: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads. The settings are platform-independent, meaning that they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.You may refuse the use of cookies for range measurement and advertising purposes by selecting the appropriate settings on the Network Advertising Initiative deactivation page ( http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ ) and in addition the US ( http://www.aboutads.info/ choices ) or European website ( http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/ ).ONLINE PRESENCE IN SOCIAL MEDIAWe maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to communicate with customers, prospects and users active there and to inform them about our services.We would like to point out that user data collected in this context may be processed outside the European Union. This may entail risks for users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights. We would like to point out that US providers certified under the Privacy Shield undertake to comply with EU privacy standards.Furthermore, user data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user behavior and information about user interests derived from users behavior can be used to create user profiles. These can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the platforms which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies in which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored will usually be stored on the user's computer. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles irrelevant of the device type used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).The processing of users' personal data is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests in effective information for users and communication with users pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If the users are asked by the respective providers to consent to the data processing (i.e. by ticking a check box or pressing a button), the legal basis of the processing is art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and art. 7 GDPR.For a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out), we refer to the information by the providers at the links belowAlso in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we would like to point out that these can be claimed most effectively from the providers.

GDPR), we use third-party content and/or services in order to integrate these providers content and services, such as videos or fonts (collectively referred to as "content").This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on users devices and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, time of access, and other information regarding the use of our online offer.YOUTUBEWe embed videos shown on Googles YouTube platform: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

Facebook will directly transmit the content of the plugin to the users device and incorporate it into the online offer. Data processed as part of this process can be used to create user profiles. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform the users based on our level of knowledge.Through the integrated plugins, Facebook is informed that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook is able attribute the visit to the users Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example by pressing the Like button or leaving a comment, this information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, it is still possible for Facebook to find out and store their IP address. According to Facebook, only anonymized IP addresses are stored in Germany.The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and configuration options to protect the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook's privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.Users who are Facebook members and do not want Facebook to collect data about them via this online offer and attribute this information to their Facebook member data, must log out of Facebook and delete their cookies before using our online offer.
