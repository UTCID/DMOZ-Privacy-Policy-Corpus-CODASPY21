Thank you for visiting The Texas Weddings LTD website.. By accessing or using The Texas Weddings LTD website (including the mobile optimized version of the website), online services, mobile and The Texas Weddings LTD’s pages and other presences on various social networking platforms (each, a "Site"), whether automated or otherwise, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, to the collection and use of your information as set forth in our Privacy Policy, which is located at https://texasweddings.com/privacy.php, and any additional terms and conditions that are referenced below or otherwise may apply to specific areas of, or offerings on or through, the Site. Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using or accessing the Site. These Terms of Use supersede any prior Terms of Use and apply to all visitors, users, vendors (all of the foregoing, collectively “Users”).
Certain features, products or software that you purchase or download from the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented to you at the time that you use, purchase or download them. When you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes or similar promotion or offer, we present the terms and conditions for the contest or sweepstakes to you.
You represent that you are legally able to accept these Terms of Use, and affirm that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, or have obtained parental or guardian consent to do so. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the Site.
We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use at any time. Such changes will be effective when posted, provided that we may only amend the alternative dispute resolution, venue and time limit of claims provisions to the extent allowed by applicable law. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Terms of Use as modified.
NOTE: THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION IN THE "BINDING ARBITRATION" SECTION BELOW THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY "DISPUTE" (AS DEFINED BELOW) BETWEEN YOU AND US OR OUR AFFILIATES. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE "BINDING ARBITRATION" SECTION BELOW.
SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING NEW JERSEY, HAVE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND OTHER LAWS THAT MAY APPLY TO THE SERVICES AND THAT DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN PROVISIONS SUCH AS LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, AMONG OTHERS. TO THE EXTENT THAT A LIMITATION, EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR OTHER PROVISION SET OUT HEREIN IS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SUCH LIMITATION, EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR PROVISION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Use of Our Site
Certain areas of the Site provide a place for Users to interact with other Users and book services offered by such Users. However, The Texas Weddings LTD does not provide any such User services, and is not an agent or representative for any User. Therefore, The Texas Weddings LTD has no control over any User’s activity on the Site, including interactions between Users, and does not make any representations regarding the quality, accuracy or safety of the services being provided by a User, or the activities or transactions between Users.
You acknowledge that the Site is a neutral venue and not a broker, and you are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.

Membership in, and use of, the Site is void where prohibited.
Ownership of Site Content and Submissions
We or our licensors or partners own the intellectual property rights in the content and materials displayed on the Site (“Site Content”). You may not modify, copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, translate, sell, create derivative works, exploit, or distribute in any manner or medium (including by email or other electronic means) any Site Content unless explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use or by the owner of the materials. You may, however, from time to time, download and/or print one copy of individual pages of the Site for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices.
If you submit or post any materials or content to the Site, you grant us and our business partners a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, assignable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use such materials and content, including alterations thereof, in any form or media, and via any technology we choose, whether it exists now or is created in the future. You represent that (i) any materials and content posted or otherwise submitted by you to the Site is original to you and that you have the right to grant us these rights, (ii) the posting and use of your materials and content on or through the Site does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third-party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, rights of publicity, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights, and (iii) such posts and the content contained therein abide by the Rules of Conduct set forth in these Terms of Use.
You may choose, or we may invite you, to submit comments or ideas about the Sites and our other products and services, including without limitation about how to improve the Sites or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place The Texas Weddings LTD under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your Idea, The Texas Weddings LTD does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to The Texas Weddings LTD, developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
Responsibility for Public Postings and Content
Responsibility for what is posted in public areas of the Site lies with each User – you alone are responsible for the material you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Site. You alone are responsible for assessing the credibility of other User postings. We do not control the material that you or others may post or otherwise make available in such areas, and you understand that we have no obligation to monitor any such material or to edit or delete it. However, we reserve the right to do so. We are not a publisher of user posts and we are not responsible for their accuracy or legality.
You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by us or any of our directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "Our Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential Terms of Use violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither we nor any of Our Representatives shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of these Terms of Use.
Although Our Representatives may moderate content, conduct and Terms of Use compliance on the Site at our discretion, Our Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on our behalf will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on our behalf will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported Terms of Use violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any of Our Representatives (or by anyone else acting on our behalf or by anyone purportedly acting on our behalf) that we (including but not limited to any of Our Representatives, anyone else acting on our behalf, or anyone purportedly acting on our behalf) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported Terms of Use violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that we, Our Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on our behalf shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that we, Our Representative or anyone else on our behalf would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported Terms of Use violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by Texas Weddings LTD owners or directors and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.
Registration and Log In
To access certain features or areas of the Site, you may be required to provide personal and/or demographic information as part of a registration or log-in process. In addition, certain features of the Site are only available to our registered users, and to access those areas of the Site you will be required to log in using your username and password.
You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the applicable registration or log-in form, and you are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date (this includes your contact information, so that we can reliably contact you). Failure to accurately and completely provide, and timely update, information about yourself is reasonable grounds for us to suspend or terminate your account and refuse you service in the future. The information you submit must describe you (you may not impersonate another person or entity), and you may not sell, share or otherwise transfer your account information.
By registering you understand and agree that your information will be shared with Texas Weddings LTD clients, vendors, associates and partners to help provide you with the most up to date and relevant information for wedding planning. Your information may include your name, email, phone number, wedding date, wedding location, mailing address, and any other information that you provide.  By registering you are opting in to this service, if you do not wish for your information to be shared do not use the website or any registered services within.
You are responsible for all activity occurring when the Site is accessed through your account, whether authorized by you or not. Therefore, if you create an account, be sure to protect the confidentiality of your account password. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your password or account information.
If you are a business (including a vendor) and experience a dissolution, merger or other significant change in personnel (e.g., sale of company), then we, in our sole discretion, have the right to determine whether to keep active, transfer or terminate your account, including all User reviews and other Site Content previously associated with such account.
Electronic Communications
The communications between you and us via the Site use electronic means, whether you visit the Site or send us an email, or whether we post notices on the Site or communicate with you via email. For contractual purposes, you consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form and you agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.
Copyright Infringement Notices
If you are a copyright owner who believes in good faith that your copyrighted material has been reproduced, posted or distributed on the Site in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, please inform our designated copyright agent by sending written notice to weddingguide@texasweddings.com. We have a policy of terminating the Site usage privileges of users who are infringers of intellectual property rights.
Changes to the Site
We reserve the right to make changes to, or to suspend or discontinue (temporarily or permanently), the Site or any portion of the Site. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.
Suspension or Termination of Access
We have the right to deny access to, and to suspend or terminate your access to, the Site, or to any features or portions of the Site, and to remove and discard any content or materials you have submitted to the Site, at any time and for any reason, including for any violation by you of these Terms of Use (including the Rules of Conduct). In the event that we suspend or terminate your access to and/or use of the Site, you will continue to be bound by the Terms of Use that were in effect as of the date of your suspension or termination.
Linking Policies
The Site may contain links to other websites or to third-party sellers of products and services. Such links are provided for your convenience only, and you access them at your own risk. We are not responsible for, and do not endorse, the content of any such sites, or the products and services sold on them, nor do we take responsibility for the accuracy of any such sites. When you visit a linked site, you should read the terms of use and privacy policy that govern that particular linked site.
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or relating to your misuse or unauthorized use of the Site (including any User Provided Service or WWCD), your submissions to the Site, or any violation of these Terms of Use, or applicable law, by you or by someone accessing the Site via your account. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you agree to cooperate with us in defending such claims. This indemnification, defense and hold harmless obligation will survive these Terms of Use and the termination of your use of the Site.
Jurisdictional Issues
We control and operate the Site from our facilities in the United States of America and, unless otherwise specified, the materials displayed on the Site are presented solely for the purpose of promoting products and services available in the United States, its territories, possessions and protectorates. We do not represent that materials on the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you choose to access the Site from other locations, you are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
Applicable Law; No Waiver; Severability
These Terms of Use, and the relationship between you and us, will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Texas, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and we nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to intentions reflected in such provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.
Binding Arbitration
Other than those matters described under ‘Exclusions from Arbitration’ below, you and we agree that all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use (including the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section), the Site or any content or services thereon (each, a "Dispute"), that cannot be resolved through negotiation in accordance with the ‘Notice of Dispute; Negotiation’ clause below, shall be settled by final binding arbitration, in accordance with the terms of this Section and to the extent permitted by law. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act applies to this agreement.
Exclusions from Arbitration
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY EITHER PARTY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT YOU OR WE MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
Notice of Dispute; Negotiation
IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH US, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO LEGAL DEPARTMENT AT THE ADDRESS ABOVE TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION.
You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than sixty (60) days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If we do not resolve your Dispute within sixty (60) days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, either party may pursue a claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Section.
Severability
If any clause within this Section (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section will be unenforceable, the Dispute will be decided by a court, and you and we each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.
Continuation
This Section shall survive any termination of the provision of the associated services to you.
