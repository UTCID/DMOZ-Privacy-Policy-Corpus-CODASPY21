Most people, who have had the chance to deal with insurance companies know that the companies tend to act fast when it comes to injury claims. The speed with which they move is aimed at trying to avoid lengthy litigation, which would see them pay more than they want to. A team of Phoenix Car Accident Attorneys help you get compensation after an accident. The aim to get to the claimants before they can get to an accident lawyer.
Hire an accident lawyer
For your best interests
When the insurance companies offer to settle the claims quickly, they are not thinking of the claimant’s best interest. They are trying to ensure that the transaction is as economical as possible. If you do not know much about the legal process, hiring an accident lawyer is a superb idea. You can have someone on your side when dealing with the insurance company.
Complex procedures
Another good reason to get an accident lawyer is to have someone who understands the intricate language that is involved in insurance policies. Most of these insurance companies use claim adjusters who are known for their tactics. They are hired to try and intimidate claimants into taking the deal they are offering.
Most people find themselves accepting the deal due to frustration, and to evade pressure from their insurance company. When you have an accident lawyer, you have someone who can give as much as they can take.
Handling statements
When dealing with an insurance company, it is always advisable to have written statements. This will help to avoid “changing” versions of the story as the parties try to recreate the events. An accident lawyer will contribute to ensuring that you have written or recorded statements that will help with the case. Many claim adjusters work over the phone and try to get the best deal for their employer.
Statute of limitations
Mostly, you will find guidelines and procedural limitations on how insurance companies should deal with claims filed by accident victims. The procedure has statutes of limitations, which most people may not know. An insurance company can withhold payment until the time to file a claim has elapsed. It is important to get someone with legal experience to deal with all the issues before it is too late.
While there may be times when it is not necessary to get an accident lawyer, if there is a dispute as to who caused the accident, or there has been a serious injury, it is wise to seek legal counsel.
