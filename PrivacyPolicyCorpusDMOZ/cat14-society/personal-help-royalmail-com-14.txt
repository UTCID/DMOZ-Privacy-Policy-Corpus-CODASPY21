Please Note due to the current coronavirus situation, we’ve made the following changes:
Special Delivery Guaranteed by 9am -
For items posted from Monday 28 September onwards we will guarantee deliveries by 11.00am* the next working day.  As a result, from that date we will not consider a claim for delay or consequential loss as a result of delay for items posted using the Special Delivery Guaranteed by 9.00am service that are delivered between 9.00am and 11.00am the next working day.
For items posted from Tuesday 31 March 2020 up to Saturday 26 September 2020 we guarantee items to be delivered by 12.00pm* the next working day.  As a result, we will not consider a claim for delay or consequential loss as a result of delay for items posted using the Special Delivery Guaranteed by 9.00am service, that are delivered between 9.00am and 12.00pm the next working day during this period.
Special Delivery Guaranteed by 1pm -
For items posted from Monday 28 September 2020 onwards we will guarantee deliveries by 4.00pm* the next working day.  As a result, from that date we will not consider a claim for delay or consequential loss as a result of delay for items posted using the Special Delivery Guaranteed by 1.00pm service that are delivered between 1.00pm and 4.00pm the next working day.
For items posted from Tuesday 31 March 2020 up to Saturday 26 September 2020 we guarantee items to be delivered by 9.00pm* the next working day.  As a result, we will not consider a claim for delay or consequential loss as a result of delay for items posted using the Special Delivery Guaranteed by 1.00pm service that are delivered between 1.00pm and 9.00pm the next working day during this period.
For both Special Delivery Guarantee by 9am and by 1pm this includes items where a guarantee for a Saturday delivery has been purchased.
We’re no longer asking recipients to sign for items delivered on or after Saturday 14 March 2020 until further notice. Due to the extraordinary nature of current events, we will not pay a postage fee refund for not capturing a signature. Similarly, we will not consider a claim for loss based on the lack of signature. We will still capture the recipient’s name and confirmation of delivery which can be viewed at www.royalmail.com/track-your-item. Find out more at www.royalmail.com/coronavirus.
