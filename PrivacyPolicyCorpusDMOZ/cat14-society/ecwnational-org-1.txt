Requirements for submitting content for use by the Episcopal Church Women
The National Episcopal Church Women honor existing copyrights.
The term ‘content’ is used to define all print, digital, text, music, voice, and image mediums.
The use of copyrighted content is protected by United States Law as well as other international Laws.
To ensure the website and other digital and print assets comply with copyright laws, we will not post content copied or borrowed from other copyright holders. This means that if you submit a poem, article, or story to us, the content of the story must be original to you. Short use of quoted material, with citation, may be allowed.
If the work is copyrighted, it may be used if the copyright holder provides written approval for our use.
Online images are one of the most critical areas for oversight.
The ECW may license the use of specific content for special projects. These negotiations are overseen by the national board.
It is not the position of the ECW to define policy for church activities. The Episcopal Church provides legal oversight for the use of copyrighted material within services and information about how to use it may be found on their website.
