The Parochial Church Council of Saint Simon’s Southsea complies with its obligations under the GDPR by keeping personal data up to date; by storing and destroying it securely; by not collecting or retaining unnecessary or excessive amounts of data; by protecting personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access and disclosure; and by ensuring that appropriate measures are in place to protect personal data.
We use your personal data for the following purposes:

to maintain our own accounts and record (including the processing of gift aid applications);
to inform you of news, events, activities and services running at St Simon’s and other churches with whom we have a formal mission partnership;

You give explicit consent so that we can keep you informed about news, events, activities and services, and process your gift aid donations.
