Cookies and opt-out
Since a change in EU internet law, we’re required to inform you of the following information regarding cookies.
Our website occasionally uses a technology known as cookies to store small amounts of data on our visitors’ computers or devices. You’ll have come across them if you log into any intranet or webmail and find you’re still logged in when you next visit that secure page… that functionality is down to… cookies!
By using this website you agree that we can place cookies on your computer unless you change your browser settings. Our cookies cannot be used to identify you. In fact, we believe there is no reason for any concern over any of the cookies used on our website; however certain users may have privacy concerns or consider some cookies to be intrusive. Below we outline what cookies we use and why, to help you make an informed choice.
You may set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a web site tries to place cookies in your browser program. Please consult with your browser documentation for instructions on how to do this.
These are cookies set by ourselves or the software running on our website. These are generally required for correct operation of certain parts of the website and generally only last for the duration of your browser session.
We have listed our first-party cookies below, along with their purpose and expiry period.
First-Party Cookies
Name: Analytics
Expires: At the end of your session (when you close your browser)
Analytics is a tool made by Google, which we use to track visitor statistics. We do not store any information in this (session) cookie, although it is generated automatically when you visit our site, and simply gives us an idea of how many visitors we have to our pages.
Name: Anglican.org
Expires: At the end of your session (when you close your browser)
These are the international owners of the Anglican.org domain, of which all Diocesan websites are subdomains (oxford.anglican.org, bathwells.anglican.org etc etc). We do not store any information in this (session) cookie, although it is generated automatically when you visit our site.
Third-Party Cookies
Some of the functionality of the site uses third-party plugins, for example social media buttons (Facebook, Twitter etc.). These may use cookies created by such a third-party service and although we have chosen to integrate the services with our website, we do not have control over the cookies set by these services.
We use these services as a convenience to our visitors and on the basis that the providing party adheres to their privacy and/or data use policies. (See Further Information below).
Because they are outside our control, the detail of these cookies may change, so we have listed some information and links about the respective third parties to help you find out more. The actual cookies may also vary depending whether you are logged into those social media sites when browsing our website.

Controlling and Blocking Cookies
We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you wish to block cookies from this website (or any other), you can do so by modifying your browser settings. Your browser’s Help function should advise you on how to do this.

Copyright advice
Any resources of the Bristol Diocese website are free for reproduction in your Parish newsletter, magazine or website. However, if you produce a newsletter or website which is not directly affiliated with the Diocese (a ‘local digest’ magazine for example, or news from another religion/denomination) and you would like to use these resources, please gain permission from our Communications Officer.
All images on the internet belong to someone, using images (or any other media) you didn’t produce yourself is a breach of copyright. Whether you use the image for non-profit or religious purposes makes no difference; you are still at risk if you do not have permission to use images on your website or in your Parish Magazine. Legal settlement normally means a fine of around £1,500-£3,000 for breach of copyright.
The simplest way to avoid legal difficulties is to search for ‘Creative Commons’ licensed images from a website like Flickr (select the “Only search within Creative Commons-licensed content” option before running your image search). You could also purchase images from a stock imagery website such as iStockPhoto or even take the photos yourself – you automatically own copyright of your own photos.
Public information policy
Our online policy for Clergy/Diocesan Officers’ personal data is that business contact information will be shared, but anything more will require your consent. So our online info may include:
your name
your work email address
your work contact phone number
Our online info will not include (without your consent):
a photo of you
your home contact details.
This applies to all Diocesan websites, searchable Diocesan Databases online. If at any stage you think more information is available online about you than you are happy with, please contact the Diocesan Office to make changes.
