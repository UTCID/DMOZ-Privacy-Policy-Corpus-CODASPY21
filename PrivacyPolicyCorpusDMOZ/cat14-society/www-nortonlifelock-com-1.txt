Your Privacy is Our Priority
Data and its protection are at the center of everything we do: Our business is built on security, compliance, and accountability, enabling us to protect our customers’ most valuable assets.
Trust is Fundamental to Our Business
Committed to safeguarding privacy and personal data
Protecting your most valuable assets is at the heart of our business, and NortonLifeLock remains vigilant about safeguarding your personal data and the privacy of the individuals it represents.
Whether it’s the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or California’s new Consumer Privacy Act, NortonLifeLock is committed to complying with applicable legal requirements, and continuously enhancing our privacy and security practices across the globe.
We are dedicated to transparency every step of the way. We provide a Global Privacy Statement to explain the company’s personal data processing practices, as well as Product and Service Privacy Notices to explain in detail how data is collected and used for each specific product.
Privacy is a fundamental human right and protecting personal data—whether our own, our customers’, or our partners’—is part of our commitment to corporate responsibility.
