Cookies on Patrick Arundell Astrology (patrickarundell.com)
Cookies can have many different tasks on the internet we use them for...
Statistics:
We use Googles' analytics to monitor how visitors move around our site and how visitors reached it. This is used so that we can see figures on which types of content visitors use most and how long they stayed. You can opt out of these if you want at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
Third Party Social Media, Psychic/Astrology Services Partners
Social networks, video and other services we offer are run by other companies. These companies may drop cookies on your computer when you use them or if you are already logged in to them.
Registration cookies: when you register with one of our services, we generate cookies that let us know whether you are signed in or not. Our servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and load specific information relevant to you and your needs.
Anonymous analytics cookies: every time someone visits our website, partner services or software provided by another organisation generates an 'anonymous analytics cookie'. These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before. Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies and, if you don't, we generate new ones. This allows us to track how many individual users we have, and how often they visit the site. We use these cookies to gather statistics, for example, the number of visits to a page.
Third party cookies: on some pages of our website, other organisations may also set their own anonymous cookies. They do this to track the success of their application, or to customise the application for you. Because of how cookies work, our website cannot access these cookies, nor can the other organisation access the data in cookies we use on our website. For example, when you share a page using a social-media sharing button (Facebook, Twitter or Google+) on our site, the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.
Advertising
Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to the Website and other websites. In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, about cookies, and about how to turn this feature off, please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
How to turn cookies off
