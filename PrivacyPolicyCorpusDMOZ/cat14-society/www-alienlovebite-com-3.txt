I have used this term to describe unusual experiences such as alien abductions, extraterrestrial contact, mind control, cult abuse and military abductions (MILABS) related to the alien abduction syndrome. Other anomalous trauma experiences include spiritual warfare and near death experiences.More information about alien abductions, MILABS and alien interference in human interactions is available in the articles section of this website and through my book, The Love Bite: Alien Interference in Human Love Relationships.Many alien abductees and especially those who have experienced some level of military/secret government level of involvement in their experiences, often suffer from PTSD and many anxiety disorders and addictions. In addition to these conditions many have physical health issues such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, immune disorders and gynecological anomalies.Due to the ostracism, disbelief and denial by mainstream society, medical and psychological professionals use the term anomalous trauma for these syndromes. Treatment for these syndromes is generally geared towards emotional support, validation of the person’s experience, counseling and hypnotherapy. Regression hypnosis is a useful tool in recovering amnesiac memories and the easing of PTSD symptoms. Other healing methods include prayer, meditation, relaxation, dream work and lucid dreaming. Shamanic healing modalities such as soul retrieval have been found to be effective for some individuals.Anomalous Trauma: Types & Definitions1. Alien Abductions & Extraterrestrial ContactSingular event UFO sightings with an abduction and missing timeMultiple UFO sightings and alien abductions and/or visitations, with or without multigenerational family involvement with alien visitationsET contact with multiple visitations, claims of benevolent Space BrothersET contact via “dream visitations” and channeled information2. Alien Interference in Human Love RelationshipsAliens setting up two targeted partnersAliens breaking up and/or disrupting a love relationshipHuman/Military setting up or breaking up two “abductees or milabs”Unseen cult influences to set up/arrange a relationship or marriage3. Military Abductions (MILABS)Alien abductees intermittently taken by human military or “secret government” for interrogation purposes about alien contactsAlien abductees sheep dipped and trained as operatives under mind control for “secret government”, “Secret Space Programs” or intelligence agenciesMilitary abductees with no alien contacts. This may involve the “super soldiers” under mind control used as covert agents for intelligence or military agencies4. Spiritual Warfare and Hyperdimensional Interference PatternsMalevolent alien visitations and attacks, such as Greys, Reptilians, DraconiansDemonic attacks such as incubi, succubus and vampiristic attached entitiesAttacks by “hosted” human beings, black magicians, sorcerersExorcisms, Deliverance and Spirit Releasement experiences Related articlesAlien versus Demonic Articles5. Cult AbuseSatanic Ritual Abuse, Illuminati Bloodline family cultsUFO Channeling CultsMK-ULTRA victimizationMiscellaneous CultsNarcissistic Abuse, Co-Dependency Issues and CPTSD6. Near Death ExperiencesTraumatic illnesses, or life threatening events which take the person to the other side and back. They may be positive, frightening or just plain shocking.Angelic Intervention, Near Death Experiences and Spirit GuidesAnomalous trauma victims have often reported angelic interventions in response to prayer or when faced with dangerous life threatening situations. Near Death Experiencers, (NDE’rs) may report seeing an angelic light being assisting them to the other side of reality. A bright light is often experienced with shifts in reality. Others may see familiar relatives who have passed over. Or finding themselves in a peaceful dark void in an NDE.ET contactees and abductees may see “aliens” as helpful “Space Brothers”. In these cases, it must be discerned whether the “space brother” is in fact an alien or a deceitful shape shifter, as has been reported in numerous alien Grey and Reptilian visitations. There are both positive and negative ET type beings, some of which are quite adept at masquerading as angels of light, when in fact they are not.Angelic beings such as Archangel Michael have been reported to be helpful in assisting those involved in spiritual warfare. In exorcisms, spirit Releasement and deliverance, believers have reported angelic beings “kick out” demons and parasitic attached entities. Trauma victims who have the ability to dissociate will sometimes have extrasensory perception. This is quite common in the alien abductee population. Repeated contact with ET’s seem to open extrasensory doorways of perception. Consulting and Support GroupsInvolvement in counseling and support groups with other trauma survivors helps to relieve the discomfort of isolation, anxiety, depression and powerlessness associated with these experiences.
Complex PTSD is a common result of anomalous trauma and is often exacerbated by our own culture’s denial of its reality. It is our goal to educate the individual and public that these experiences are valid, and should be addressed just like any other trauma or relationship issues compounded by these events.Healing ModalitiesWe incorporate several healing modalities such as transpersonal and holistic body-mind exercises, trauma resolution strategies, hypnotic regressions, guided imagery to connect with Eternal Now Spirit, inner child work, Taoist Chi Gong alchemical exercises, dream work, shamatha and insight meditation, journaling and classical one on one empathic coaching. An important part of self-empowerment is learning compassionate communication and developing inner empathy. This deepens ones connection to Spirit and strengthens our inner power of rooted Source connection. By expanding our awareness, knowledge and support systems, we are better able to make wise choices and live happier lives.December 2020MTWTFSS 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031  « Nov    Newsletter Signup
