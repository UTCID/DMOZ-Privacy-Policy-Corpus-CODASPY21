T.J. Maxx Reports Security Breach
T.J. Maxx is reporting a security breach in the form of unauthorized access to its computer systems.
This appears to be a form of hacking, and law enforcement is investigating.
Some credit card companies are already notifying customers who have shopped at T.J. Maxx recently, canceling their cards, and issuing them new ones.

Military and CIA Seize Personal Records of Americans
The New York Times has an article today about the military and the CIA using little-known powers to obtain records about Americans and American companies.
Authors Eric Lichtblau and Mark Manzetti write:"The Pentagon has been using a little-known power to obtain banking and credit records of hundreds of Americans and others suspected of terrorism or espionage inside the United States, part of an aggressive expansion by the military into domestic intelligence gathering.The C.I.A. has also been issuing what are known as national security letters to gain access to financial records from American companies, though it has done so only rarely, intelligence officials say.Banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions receiving the letters usually have turned over documents voluntarily, allowing investigators to examine the financial assets and transactions of American military personnel and civilians, officials say.The F.B.I., the lead agency on domestic counterterrorism and espionage, has issued thousands of national security letters since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, provoking criticism and court challenges from civil liberties advocates who see them as unjustified intrusions into Americans’ private lives."************************************************************************
