This is potentially a disaster. We&#039;ve had this sort of thing introduced in the uk and the only thing they do successfully is transfer money from public funds to private contractors. Curiously, the government ministers in charge seem reluctant to punish the companies involved even when they&#039;re routinely breaking contracts, preferring instead to take up positions on the board of these companies, the better to improve matters, of course. More than likely it&#039;s a scam, in other words.
