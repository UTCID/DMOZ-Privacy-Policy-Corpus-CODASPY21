HistoryMole Full Terms & Conditions
1. Introduction
This Agreement is a legal document which sets out your rights and obligations, and those of
Runes Limited, a company registered in England under registration no.
3608551 ('HistoryMole', 'HistoryMole.com', 'we' or 'us'), in relation to this site and the services offered by
HistoryMole through it (the 'HistoryMole Service').
By registering for the HistoryMole Service, you agree to the terms of this Agreement, and you re-affirm that agreement every time you use it. Visitors to the
HistoryMole Service ('Casual Users') who do not register to become a Member (see 2 below) similarly affirm that they are bound by this Agreement each time they access the
HistoryMole Service. You should be aware that this Agreement may change from time to time in accordance with Clause
21 below.
We are not an internet service provider, however. In order to avail of the
HistoryMole Service, you must have internet access and all the software (and skills) required for email and web usage.
2. Categories of Member
People who register for the HistoryMole Service become "Members". They must be at least 18 years of
age, or have the consent of their legal guardian.
The Membership divides between the following categories:
Registered User, fee of charge.
Subscribed User, annual subscription fee.
Subscribed Organization, annual subscription fee.
As well as being able to browse the HistoryMole Service like any
Casual User, Members may additionally:
receive an increased data access quotas.
opt to receive emailed messages, which are selected during the Registration process (as added to, or de-selected,
subsequently in 'My Profile').
Registered Users and Subscribed Users will be entitled to use a single UserID
with its associated password, for themselves only. It is Users' responsibility not to disclose the password or permit other
individuals
or organizations to use their UserID.
Subscribed Organizations may disclose the UserID and its associated password
to
members of their own organization only as long as those persons normally
work at the same address.
3. Registration
You undertake to register for the HistoryMole Service using accurate and current information about yourself.
If you are asked for, and provide, details of a credit, debit or charge card; in that event, you must ensure that (a) you are fully entitled to use that card, and (b) it has available funds sufficient to cover the charges which are deducted from it.
As part of the registration process for the HistoryMole Service, you will receive a verification email, the purpose of which is to take reasonable steps to ensure that the email address you have nominated during registration is controlled by you. That email contains simple instructions which you must follow.
4. Subscription Fees
If you decide to become a Subscribed User or a Subscribed Organization, and therefore pay our
subscription fee, you are agreeing to take the facilities we make available to you shortly after that fee is paid. You will not be entitled to any refund of that fee. Your
subscription will last for twelve months. If you wish to continue
subscribing after the expiry of that twelve month period, we will enable you to do so, at our then-current terms and prices.
We reserve the right to change the amount of the subscription fees, the period which it covers, the services which it enables you to obtain and other factors from time to time. However, these changes, unless they are changes under Clause 8 or Clause 9 below, will not affect your then-current
subscription.
You acknowledge that we are entitled to alter the amount or the basis of the calculation of our fees from time to time, provided that such amount or basis is clearly stated at the time when you agree to take the relevant
HistoryMole Service.
Fees paid by Members will not be rebated or refunded by HistoryMole, unless the
HistoryMole Service for which the Member has subscribed is completely withdrawn from that Member by us other than in circumstances permitted under this Agreement.
We may add new or ancillary services from time to time which require the payment of fees, either to us or a nominated third party, on terms which will be provided to you at the time.
5. Privacy policy
HistoryMole's Privacy Policy forms part of this Agreement, and by agreeing to this Agreement, you also give your consent to the way we may handle your personal data in that policy. Given the global nature of the World Wide Web, any posting on the
HistoryMole Service (including any which contain personal information) is, of course, accessible to internet users around the world.
6. HistoryMole's Role
You, whether you are a Member or just a non-Member who visits the HistoryMole
Service, acknowledge that we are not and cannot be
responsible for the behavior of Members - whether on the HistoryMole Service or outside of it. We only provide a venue where the
HistoryMole Service may be accessed.

take reasonable steps to vet the substance of the information presented,
we take no responsibility for its accuracy or completeness.
7. Additional Services

HistoryMole Service from time to time. Your use of those services may be subject to additional
Terms & Conditions, or rules of use, which you must comply with. Provided that those terms or rules are notified to you on the
HistoryMole Service in an appropriate manner (as determined by HistoryMole
in its reasonable discretion), any failure by you to comply with a material provision of the terms or rules governing those services will amount to a breach of this Agreement.
8. Operation of HistoryMole Services
HistoryMole reserves the right to withdraw or modify one or more aspects of the
HistoryMole Service where we have legal or technical reasons to do so (including technical difficulties experienced by
HistoryMole or on the Internet). There may also be times when the HistoryMole
Service becomes unavailable, whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis. For security or other reasons, we may require you to change password or other information which facilitates access to the
HistoryMole Service.

HistoryMole Service while you are using the HistoryMole Service, or through your email
address(es).

monitor material which appears on the HistoryMole Service, and that we
