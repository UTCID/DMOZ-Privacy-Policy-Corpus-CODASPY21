Soto v. Iacavino, 2003 WL 21281762 (U.S.Dist.Ct., S.D.N.Y., June 4, 2003) (not officially
published) (an HIV+ New York inmate alleged that he was deprived of his constitutional right to
medical care in violation of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983. The court dismissed the claims against the prison

for retaliatory transfer and destruction of personal property against the guards, but doubted and denied
the causal connection between withholding the medical care and any adverse action).

laws allegedly were selectively enforced based on her supposed sexual orientation. Stemler v. City of
Florence, 126 F.3d 856 (6th Cir. 1997) The claim was sent back to district court. The district court, in
2001, found that even though an abuse-of-process claim based on the same facts was tried in state
court and summary judgment granted to the defendants (police officers), the issue was not precluded,
and could be heard in federal court. The 6th Circuit in the latest decision found that the issue was
precluded, and could not be tried in federal court. The district court should have granted summary
judgment to the defendants).

Crimes Act" under which the courts are authorized to impose an enhanced sentence if the jury finds that

International Cases:
Australia: Family Court of Australia has affirmed the ruling of Family Court Judge Chisholm in the case
of Attorney General for the Commonwealth v. Kevin and Jennifer, Appeal No. EA 97/2001
(Feb. 21, 2003), finding that "Kevin," a post-operative female-to-male transsexual, should be
considered a man for purposes of the law and thus qualified to marry Jennifer.
Australia: On Aug. 6, 2003 in the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Young v. Australia,
Communication No. 941/2000.
(The Committee's "views" are available at http://www.unhchr.ch,
Treaty Bodies Database Search, "Edward Young.") Edward Young had been in a 38-year relationship
with his partner, Mr. C., a war veteran.
After Mr. C.'s death, Mr. Young applied for a veteran's
dependant pension under the federal Veteran's Entitlement Act (VEA), which defines "dependant" as
including a "partner," and "partner" as a person "living with a person of the opposite sex ... in a
marriage-like relationship." He argued that the denial of a pension constituted sexual orientation
discrimination contrary to Article 26 of the Covenant: "All persons ... are entitled without discrimination
to the equal protection of the law...[T]he law shall...guarantee ... protection against discrimination on any
ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin,
property, birth or other status." The Committee found that the [Australian Government] violated article
26.by denying [Mr. Young] a pension on the basis of his sex or sexual orientation.
Canada: The Supreme Court of Canada rejected an attempt by private parties to interject themselves
into the same-sex marriage litigation.
In a unanimous disposition announced on October 9, 2003 the
court granted a motion to quash applications for leave to appeal the marriage decision by the Ontario
Court of Appeals, which had been filed by right-wing and religious groups, and also dismissed motions
by these groups to be added as parties to the case for purpose of obtaining standing to appeal. The
Association for Marriage and the Family in Ontario v. Halpern; The Interfaith Coalition on
Marriage and Family v. Halpern, No. 29879.
European Court: On June 10, 2003 Advocate General (Mr.) D maso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer of the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (E.C.J.) delivered his Opinion (available at
http://europa.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en) in Case C-117/01, K.B. v. National Health
Service Pensions Agency.
The case, referred to the E.C.J. by the Court of Appeal (of England and
Wales), concerns the non-eligibility of the transsexual male partner of a non-transsexual female
employee for a "widower's pension" if she were to pre-decease him.
Colomer found that "the unequal
treatment to which transsexuals are subject amounts to sexual discrimination," because "the impediment
to marriage in [K.B.] is based on ... the gender reassignment of [the employee's partner], which is
covered by Article 141 E.C., following [P.]."
Israel: The Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot has reported that a family court in Nazareth ruled against
a claim by a surviving gay life partner to inherit from his intestate deceased.
The court ruled Oct. 15,
2003 in the case of Doe v. Administrator General that the legal principal allowing unmarried
opposite-sex long-term partners to inherit did not apply to same-sex couples.
An appeal is being
pursued.
Scotland: A Scottish Appeal Court panel ruled on July 22 that "shameless indecency" is not a crime in
Scotland.
The term was used in a 19th century treatise and then taken up by some courts as a sort-of
catch-all criminal offense, but the court found that it was unduly vague in letting judges send people to
prison for conduct that the judge might find personally offensive but was nowhere specified in the law.
Procurator Fiscal, Dunoon v. Dominick, #XJ147/30. Gay Scotland #147 - Nov. 2003.
South Africa: On July 31, 2003 in Marie Fourie & Cecelia Bonthuys v. Minister of Home Affairs,
Case CCT 25/03, the Constitutional Court of South Africa refused an application by a lesbian couple
for leave to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court, from the Oct. 18, 2002 decision of the Pretoria
High Court dismissing their constitutional challenge to the exclusion of same-sex couples from civil
marriage.
South Africa: Adopting what it called an "incremental step" in common law development, the Supreme
Court of Appeal of South Africa ruled in Du Plessis v. Road Accident Fund, Case No. 443/2002
(Sept. 19, 2003), that the surviving gay life partner of a road accident victim was entitled to apply to the
Fund for compensation on the same basis as a surviving legal spouse.
UK: Since the July 11, 2002, judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg Court) in
Goodwin v. United Kingdom (Sept. 2002 Law Notes), the UK has been in ongoing violation of
Articles 8 (respect for private life) and 12 (right to marry) of the European Convention on Human
Rights, by failing to permit transsexual men and women to change the sex on their birth certificates and
to contract a different-sex marriage in their reassigned sex.
The only question has been when the UK
will remedy this violation, and whether the remedy will be provided by the judiciary, or by a
combination of executive and legislative action.
On April 10, 2003 in Bellinger v. Bellinger, a panel
of five Law Lords of the House of Lords (the United Kingdom's highest appellate court) unanimously
declined to provide an immediate remedy and left compliance with the Strasbourg Court's judgment in
Goodwin to the executive and legislature (for the full text of Bellinger, google "House of Lords
Judgments").
UK: On June 19, 2003 a five-judge panel of the (judicial) House of Lords, the United Kingdom's
highest court, unanimously rejected arguments that the dismissal of a gay member of the Royal Air
Force (R.A.F.), and a public school's failure to deal with the harassment of a lesbian teacher by her
students, violated the employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.
The arguments were
made in Macdonald v. Advocate General for Scotland, on appeal from the Court of Session, Inner
House (Scotland) (Summer 2001 Law Notes), and Pearce v. Governing Body of Mayfield School,
on appeal from the Court of Appeal (England and Wales).
The Law Lords combined the cases into a
single ruling.
