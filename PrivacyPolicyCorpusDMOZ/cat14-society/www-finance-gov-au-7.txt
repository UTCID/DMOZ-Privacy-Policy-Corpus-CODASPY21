12. Project closure
12.1 Conducting a post project review
Reviewing the closing process involves examining current processes and documenting responsibilities and related timeframes during the year, and at year-end. By mapping all, or selected key processes, a clear picture can be gained of the work steps and related controls required, making it easier to streamline and standardise work activities, eliminate unnecessary steps, strengthen controls, and prevent process errors.
Ongoing improvements in individual processes can also help to ensure that the close process remains efficient.
12.1.1 Annual process review by the Chief Financial Officer
Reporting on performance should be supplemented by an annual review of the financial statements production process. Such a review is very important to the planning process, as it provides the opportunity to make improvements in the future, where necessary.
Aspects that could be considered in the review include:
the involvement of senior management
the leadership and expertise within the CFO group
the appropriateness of information systems and other records
the extent and reliability of internal controls
the completeness and accuracy of the draft financial statements
the availability and knowledge of accounting staff resources
understanding and cooperation of business area management
the cost effectiveness of the contribution made by external specialists
the extent and timing of any work undertaken by internal audit
arrangements with the ANAO for conducting its work
the involvement of the audit committee in reviewing the financial statements
any issues raised by the CFO and accountable authority affecting the financial statements
meeting of timelines for completing individual tasks
the effectiveness and efficiency of assurance arrangements, and
the adequacy of contingency plans.
The review team should make a record of the key issues identified and distribute the document among the various contributors for comment/confirmation. The record should outline any corrective action to be taken, and allocate responsibility for those actions.
12.1.2 Consultation and distribution for the review
An assessment should involve key members of the finance team as well as representatives of any other contributors to the financial statements, such as business areas, accountable authority, the audit committee, internal audit and the ANAO. It should also involve any new members of the team so they can appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the previous year’s process. Larger organisations with many contributors may find it useful to supplement discussions with a survey of business areas and other stakeholders.
12.1.3 Review of the financial statements format
Once the entity has developed a format for the financial statements, there should be a review process in each subsequent year to assess whether adjustments were required (or are recommended for future years) due to:
changes in accounting standards
Department of Finance requirements, or
the nature of the entity’s operations.
This process should be integrated with the entity’s normal process for considering the effect of such changes and should feed into planning for the following year’s financial statements.
