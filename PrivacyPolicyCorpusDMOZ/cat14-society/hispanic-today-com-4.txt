How to write an email reply to an interview request
In a previous piece we discussed “How to write an email reply to an interview request” and how to write an appropriate response based on your interest. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind while writing the job winning email reply.
Important Guidelines:
You can consider the following examples while responding to an interview request:-
You should start your email by thanking the hiring manager for consideration.
If you are interested in the position, then you can tell them about your availability and phone number.
If you are not interested in the position, then respond politely with a short message including the reason.
It would help if you kept your tone professional and upbeat.
It would be best if you avoided emoji, emoticons, and slangs.
Write a company name and say “thanks for your invitation, I am available on any day, date, month or time (mentioned)”
You can say, “I am pleased and I would like to interview you at….”
You can also respond like that ‘Thanks for the invitation. I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to meeting with the interviewer on (date) at (time) in your office of the company.
Proofread your messages for typos before you hit send.
This is a basic structure that how you can respond to any email, but you can also add other questions and details that you want to know, such as the name of the hiring manager who is going to take your interview and the number of people in the meeting. You can also ask about the exact location of the company for a face-to-face interview. You can also ask them about the instructions for arrival if they have any.
Mistakes to avoid when you accept an interview:
If you want to make your first impression great, then you should follow the above guidelines. There can be many mistakes that you should avoid while responding to an interview request.
You should reply as soon as possible. You should reply within 24-48 hours when you finally received an invitation. You should check the reply regularly and do not wait for the company for a week. In this way, you may lose your opportunity.
You should not show an immediate response without taking the time to indicate at least one day. It can be an excellent opportunity to elaborate that you take a step and are great communicators.
You should always proofread your email. Any typing or grammar mistakes in your email won’t cost you the interview, but it creates a terrible impression. So, before sending recheck your email from start to end. This is a very beneficial trick that can prevent your email from many errors.
Do not go for an interview without preparation. Because it takes a lot of struggle and time to find a good job and apply for a good position, submit the paperwork, and then the interview is scheduled.
Wrap up
Accepting an interview opportunity is the smartest thing to do, even if you are not officially in a job search. Remember the basics of email etiquette while responding to an interview request, and follow the above guidelines. If you haven’t read the first part of this series, we recommend giving it a quick read as we discussed the important points or answers for a reply there. Here you can read the first part and do leave your feedback and if you have any question ask in comments too.
