LSS FoundationThe LSS of South Dakota Foundation was created to raise, invest, and be good stewards to funds given to support the mission. The Foundation is a separate 501(c) (3) charitable organization. Currently, $184,884 is donated annually from the LSS Foundation to LSS for its operations. Without the foundation, critical services would not be available to South Dakotans.
You may wish to earmark your giving to LSS specifically to the LSS Foundation. Your gifts will be invested and only the earnings will be spent. Your gift will continue to support LSS for years and generations to come. All estate gifts to LSS are put in the Foundation according to the policies created by the LSS Board of Directors.
We're Here for Generations to ComeOne of our goals is to continue to build the Foundation so that earnings will eventually provide significant operational support for LSS. This will provide long-term viability and guard against the uncertain and ever-evolving changes in government funding support.
The Foundation was created in 1992 and is governed by the LSS Foundation Board of Directors, which is an additional board to the LSS Governing Board.
The mission of the LSS Foundation
The LSS of South Dakota Foundation, Inc. is organized to express our heritage of Christian faith and service through support of the programs and activities of LSS of SD. The foundation actively seeks, receives and manages gifts so the income from those gifts can provide a perpetual statement of the donor's faith and maintain a secure financial base to promote wholeness for all people served by the agency.
Federal Tax ID: 46-0423090
The LSS Foundation is a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and all gifts to the LSS Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent of the law. To discuss the LSS Foundation or how you might like to help, please contact:
