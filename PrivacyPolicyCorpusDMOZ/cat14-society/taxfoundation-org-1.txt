Center for Global Tax Policy
The Tax Foundation’s Center for Global Tax Policy produces timely and high-quality data, research, and analysis on taxation in countries around the world that influences the debate toward economically principled policies.
We produce the annual International Tax Competitiveness Index, a survey of corporate tax rates around the world, and several other comparative reports that allow taxpayers, journalists, and policymakers to compare their tax policies with those in other countries.
The mission of the global program is to promote tax and fiscal policy that leads to higher economic growth and improved quality of life for taxpayers throughout the world.
