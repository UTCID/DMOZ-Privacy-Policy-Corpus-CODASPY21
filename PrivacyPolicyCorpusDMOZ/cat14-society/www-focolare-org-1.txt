The goal is unity.
The art of loving Giving of ourselves can be lifted to an art form. We aim to spread love that is universal, proactive, unconditional, empathetic, inclusive and reciprocal—whether in personal relationships or any sector of society.Unity in diversity Being one does not mean being the same! We focus on establishing dialogues with people who have no religious affiliation, between the world’s religions, among Christian denominations,
and within the Catholic Church.A more united world Despite today’s polarity, unity is possible. We create cultural and social projects that contribute to a more equal, just and harmonious society, where everyone can feel part of the rich mosaic that is the human family.
A spirituality for today’s world.
Every Focolare initiative is rooted in its spirituality of unity,
a lifestyle shared by many people of all ages and backgrounds.
It transforms our lives and relationships for the better.

Unity is a story worth telling.

What people say about Focolare
Perhaps the most impressive part of this experience, at least for me, has been the opportunity to see what relational ecumenism really looks like among people with very different backgrounds from my own.
John H. Armstrong - Ordained minister and founder of The Initiative
I want to thank God again for this gift of knowing the Focolare Movement and knowing my Focolare brothers and sisters, and I pray that our journey be inspired all the way by God so we can better understand and fulfill our responsibility towards this unity.
Dr. Mohammad Ali Shomali - resident Imam and director of Islamic Center of England
In unison with the Magisterium of the Church, the members of the Focolare Movement have become apostles of dialogue.
St. Pope John Paul II
The charism of unity is a providential stimulus and powerful support for experiencing the evangelical mystic of “the we,” that is, walking together in the history of the men and women of
our time as “of one heart and soul.”
Pope Francis
In a time of bitter divisions, Focolare is one of the few outfits with a track record of bringing people together.
John L. Allen Jr. - editor of Crux
Focolare creates a religious big tent where all people of faith can discern what we have in common and where our differences do not distance us from each other.
