Feng Shui Store > Feng Shui Store Terms And Conditions
Luckily we have never had to refer to our terms and conditions but Unfortunately we live in an age where we need terms and conditions; we only ever have around 2-3 returns per year and the last time we had a complaint was many years ago. we love receiving feedback from our clients and we are blessed with the fact that all our clients ask many questions and the fact that we have so much information on our website and also very clearly display telephone numbers making it easy to keep in contact which we feel results in extremely good customer service and the very odd complaint which is usually resolved.Feng Shui store terms and conditions.Feng Shui Ltd, trading as Feng Shui Store of 2 Douglas Road, Aylesbury Bucks, HP20 1HW, United Kingdom is referred to below as “The Feng Shui Store”.The Feng Shui Store reserves the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Any such changes will take effect when posted on the website and it is your responsibility to read the Terms and Conditions each time you use this website and your continued use of the website shall signify your acceptance to be bound by the latest terms and conditions.OrderingAll orders placed on this website are accepted at the sole discretion of The Feng Shui Store and are subject to your credit or debit card being authorised for the transaction. All transactions on this site are conducted through a secure web server (see the Site Security page for more information).When you place an order via this website you will be sent an auto-generated Order Acknowledgement by email detailing everything you have ordered. This email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from The Feng Shui Store. Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between you and The Feng Shui Store will take place on dispatch to you of the products ordered unless The Feng Shui Store notifies you that your order has not been accepted.It is your responsibility to check that the input fields for your order containing your name, address and postcode you have supplied us with are accurate and complete, since we are unable to offer any Refunds for orders either lost or delivered to the wrong address due to an error on your part. See ‘Refunds’ below.Please check if your local customs office charges duties for your purchase before ordering as we cannot be held responsible for any charges your local customs office may charge for your order.Order CancellationsIf you should decide to cancel your entire order through no fault of The Feng Shui Store, a 5% charge will be deducted from your refund payment to cover the costs incurred by The Feng Shui Store for Credit Card/PayPal processing fees and administration.Back OrdersAs we are the manufacturer of many of The Feng Shui Store brand products we are able to maintain high levels of stock all year round. On the rare occasion an item is not available, we will back order it for you and give you the option to cancel the item/order if you would rather not wait for it to be delivered. Back ordered items will not be charged until they are shipped to you.PricesAll of the prices on this site are in British Pounds Sterling (£ GBP) and include Value Added Tax (VAT) at 20% for customers residing within the European Union.Shipping & Handling ChargesDelivery to the UK will cost you a flat fee of £2.95 for postage and packing. So you can order whatever you wish within the UK and it will only ever cost you £2.95The price of delivery for our software on its own is charged at £2.95 GB Pounds to any country.The majority of our orders are sent to overseas customers – shipping rates are automatically calculated before you finalise your order – so please remember to complete the shipping information correctly by confirming the delivery zone (Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, rest of world etc).DeliveriesFrom the time of receiving your order we aim to have it processed, dispatched and in your hands as quickly as possible. We aim to process orders within 3-5 working days, once an order has been processed and is ready to send, delivery in the UK is sent first class post and takes 1-2 business days. Orders to Europe take 3-4 working days, orders to the USA and Canada normally take between 5-6 working days and the rest of the world usually takes between 6-8 business days depending on where you are in the world and your local postal service.During the lead up to the holidays (especially Chinese New Year) the number of orders we receive increases dramatically, as does the volume of parcel traffic in postal services all across the world, and this may cause delays. This should be taken into consideration when placing orders before a Public Holiday, and especially within 6 weeks of the Christmas Holidays or Chinese New Year.Large deliveries will be via  our contracted Carrier Services who will require a signature of receipt, or by Royal Mail who may also require a signature of receipt. Royal Mail handle packages up to 2 kilos in weight, and orders over this weight are shipped by a Carrier Service who do not deliver on weekends. Please note that we are only able to deliver to P.O. Box Numbers by special arrangement – please email us to request this.If there is a possibility that nobody will be at home during the day, you must provide an alternative delivery address where there will be somebody available to sign for delivery – for example, a neighbour or your works address. If there is nobody at the delivery address to accept delivery, the Carrier Service will leave a card for you to re-arrange delivery within the next 48 hours. It is your responsibility to monitor such circumstances and co-operate with the delivery service.Failed DeliveriesDue to the increasing costs of transport and storage, Carrier Services now make only one further attempt to deliver your order, after which there may be a charge for any further attempts. If you should fail to contact the Carrier Service within 48 hours to arrange re-delivery, your parcel will be sent back to The Feng Shui Store. Should your parcel be sent back to The Feng Shui Store under such circumstances, naturally there would be a further delivery charge to re-send your order.If you should choose to cancel your order and request a Refund after a failed attempted delivery, the original cost of shipping your order, plus any other costs incurred by The Feng Shui Store in retrieving your parcel, will be deducted from your Refund.Damages, Shortages and ErrorsPlease make sure that you check the condition of your package very carefully upon delivery and if there is any sign of exterior damage, include the words ‘Damaged’ on the document that you sign to accept delivery. If your parcel is damaged, do not refuse to accept delivery or this will jeopardize any claims for compensation against the shipper. All damages incurred during transit must be reported immediately to The Feng Shui Store by email and also the Carrier Company or Royal Mail. Please do not throw away the carton or any packaging materials since the Carrier Company or Royal Mail will need to inspect them before paying compensation.Any shortages or errors must be reported by email to The Feng Shui Store within 5 days of delivery, and all packaging materials must be kept for inspection by the Carrier Company or Royal Mail in case your parcel has been tampered with in transit. No claims for damages, shortages or errors will be entertained if they have not been reported to The Feng Shui Store within this period.ReturnsThe Feng Shui Store wants you to be completely happy with your purchase, so if for any reason you are not 100% satisfied, we will be happy to offer a refund, exchange or replacement on any item returned to us within thirty days of your receipt of goods, provided they are still in their original packaging, undamaged and in an unused condition.If you are returning an item because of an error on our part we will be happy to refund all delivery charges incurred. Otherwise all goods are returned at your own expense.RefundsWe will contact you via e-mail about your refund once we’ve safely received, checked and processed the returned item(s). If you are returning an item that was not due to an error on our part, the cost of shipping that item to you will be deducted from your refund. If you are requesting a Refund for a failed delivery that has been returned to The Feng Shui Store due to an incorrect address, postcode or other information you provided, the cost to The Feng Shui Store of shipping your order will not be refunded. If you do wish to return your item(s) or entire order, please contact us to receive an ‘RMA’ (Return Merchandise Authorization) number.In the unlikely event that you wish to return an entire order through no fault on our part, the full cost of documentation, packing and shipping will be deducted from your refund. You will be notified of this cost when we issue you with your Return Merchandise Authorization number. You can expect a refund in the same form of payment originally used for purchase within 14 business days of our receiving your return.Distance Selling RegulationsUnder the Distance Selling Regulations you have the right to cancel your order within 7 days, and this 7-day period begins the day after receipt of the goods. Should you wish to cancel your order under these regulations it must be in writing, by fax or by e-mail. Telephone cancellations cannot be accepted. All item(s) returned under these regulations must be received by The Feng Shui Store within 7 days and be unopened, unused, in the original manufacturers packaging and in a re-sellable condition. Under these regulations all goods are returned at your expense.Use of this siteEvery effort is taken to ensure that the information contained in this website is correct and up-to-date. However, The Feng Shui Store disclaim all warranties and representations as to the accuracy of any information contained if at any time it becomes inadvertently out-of-date or incomplete. The Feng Shui Store cannot be held responsible for any loss or damage that may arise from the use of this information.The use of Feng Shui items must not be seen as a replacement for medical care of any kind or seen as a cure for all. You must always seek professional advice in every aspect of your life whether it is do with health, wealth, relationships, legal, children etc.Regardless of what you choose as an alternative you must always seek professional advice for whatever problem you may have; as individuals and a company, Feng Shui is a way of life for us but at the same time we also use other alternatives like aromatherapy, acupuncture, reflexology and many more and at the same time we sometimes have to turn to modern medicine or see a solicitor to get results albeit very rare thankfully. In our opinion, Feng Shui is extremely powerful but just using these cures and enhancers on their own will not always solve your problems, if you smoke 40 cigarettes a day, drink 10 pints of beer, eat junk food daily please do not expect that by placing a master cure in the northeast in 2013 it will cure whatever medical problems you may have.We are required by law to tell you that Feng Shui has not been scientifically proven and Feng Shui is for entertainment purposes only. Any choices you make are your personal and legal responsibility. These Cures are not intended to replace any medical or legal advice, which should always be sought from a suitably qualified professional. however, we have an endless list of testimonies on this site by people from all walks of life. By using any advice given to you by the Feng Shui Store or Feng Shui LTD, or work done for you by Feng Shui Store or Feng Shui LTD, may bring about positive changes in your life but any choices that you make based on that information and work done are your own personal and legal responsibility. You also agree that you have sought the services of Feng Shui Store or Feng Shui LTD for yourself under your own free will and that you assume full responsibility for your decisions.The Feng Shui Store is not responsible for this site’s accuracy or the reliability of the access to this site.
