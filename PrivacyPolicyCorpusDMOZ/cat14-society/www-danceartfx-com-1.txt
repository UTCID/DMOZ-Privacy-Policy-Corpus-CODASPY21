You guys are amazing. Expect more orders from my dance crew!!
Scott D. - Co-Owner,
Street Xpressions Dance Company,Newark, DE
I was very impressed that my order arrived a week ahead of the estimated delivery date. All of my dance company members loved that the shirts were an inexpensive way to represent the dance company.
Jen K. - Director, Motor City Dance Extension, Westland, MI
Awesome. Incredibly easy to design exactly what I wanted and my college dance company has always been thrilled with the results! :-) Will definitely continue to use Custom Ink.
