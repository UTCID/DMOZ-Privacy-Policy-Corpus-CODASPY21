Veteran's Affairs Recovers Stolen Laptop
Looks like the VA has recovered the most famous stolen laptop in America.No doubt there are huge sighs of relief down at Veteran's Affairs, given the scrutiny this incident has created.
The VA is more fortunate than most private businesses in that they had marshalled all the resources of the federal government, including the FBI. Secretary Jim Nicholson made the announcement on Thursday on Capitol Hill, where he going testify again on the security breach.He didn't say how the computer or disks were recovered."There is reason to be optimistic. It's a very positive note in this very tragic incident, he said.

Privacy International Challenges Swift Data Transfers
Privacy International has announced that it has filedl complaints in 32 countries against Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (Swift), claming the that it when it shared financial information with the United States it violated European and Asian data protection laws.Complaints were also filed in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, and Hong Kong."Swift appears to have violated data protection rules in Europe by makingthese transfers without the consent of the individuals involved, and withoutthe approval of European judicial or administrative authorities. The scale of the operation, involving millions of records, places this disclosure in the realm of a fishing exercise rather than a legally authorized investigation," said Simon Davies.the largest and most influential bloc in the European Parliament,A transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S., which does not have a comprehensive data protection law, generally requires consent.

VA to Offer Veterans Free Credit Monitoring
As has been noted here before, the standard response to a large data breach is to offer the victims" a year of free credit monitoring.
However, with 26 million people, that could be quite expensive.
On the other hand, the federal government can probably afford it.Department of Veteran Affairs has announced it will offer free credit monitoring for veterans affected the recently security breach.So at least the credit agencies will make some money.Unsurprisingly, there are not actually 26.5 million individuals affected, but even a fraction of that will require some financial scrambling.The VA has already spent $25 million on an initial mailing and $200,000 per day on call centers.The VA is also hiring a special adviser on information security, accelerating security and privacy training, and reviewing procedures for accessing and storing sensitive data.
All this plus the credit monitoring shows the true costs of poor data security.

Equifax Laptop Stolen
Equifax is reporting one of their laptop computers has been stolen -- fortunately, though, it appears that it does not contain any actual credit report information.
Apparently a laptop containing Equifax employee names and Social Security numbers was stolen from a worker traveling on a train in Europe.
Apparently the theft, which took place on May 29, may affect nearly all of Equifaxes 2,500 U.S.-based employees.Given that they are a credit reporting agency, and these are their employees, one suspects that at the very least they can offer them a year or two of their credit monitoring service, if they don't already.

New Jersey Subpoenas Phone Companies. Federal Government Sues to Block the State
The New Jersey Attorney General, Zulima V. Farber, has issued subpoenas to AT&T, Verizon, Qwest, Sprint, Nextel, and Cingular Wireless, demanding to know if they have turned over customer phone records to the NSA.
The United States federal government filed a lawsuit yesterday in federal court to block New Jersey's subpoenas, saying that forcing the companies to reveal the information would endanger national security."People in New Jersey and people everywhere have privacy rights. What we were trying to determine was whether the phone companies in New Jersey had violated any law or any contractual obligations with their consumers by supplying information to some government entity, simply by request, and not by any court order or search warrant," said Farber.

Stolen Server May Result in Security Breach at AIG
NBC news is reporting that sources tell them that recently a thief broke into an office and stole a computer server belonging to the insurer AIG.
They report that names, Social Security Numbers, and medical records on 930,000 Americans may have been lost.The 930,000 people were potential customers.
They will probably be less inclined to do business with AIG after they receieve their security breach notices.

Vermont Enacts Security Breach Notification Law
Vermont has enacted a Security Breach Notification law.
(Senate Bill 284).There are now 34 states with such laws.The law provides that notification does not have to be made if misuse of the exposed personal information is not reasonably possible.
The following is from the text of the bill as enacted."Notice of a security breach pursuant to subsection (b) of this section is not required if the data collector establishes that misuse of personal information is not reasonably possible and the data collector provides notice of the determination that the misuse of the personal information is not reasonably possible pursuant to the requirements of this subsection.
If the data collector establishes that misuse of the personal information is not reasonably possible, the data collector shall provide notice of its determination that misuse of the personal information is not reasonably possible and a detailed explanation for said determination to the Vermont attorney general or to the department of banking, insurance, securities, and health care administration in the event that the data collector is a person or entity licensed or registered with the department under Title 8 or this title."

Lost VA Laptop Possibly Linked to Case of Identity Theft
Channel 4 News is Pittsburgh has reported that a local veteran is a victim of identity theft.
That was to be predicted, of course, but the the identity thief tried to get access to his VA funds.He had reported a case of identity theft to the FTC. He then received a call from the FTC asking him for more information.But the call was not real -- the FTC does not call victims.This incident is probably not related to the lost laptop.
Still, it could be, and demonstrates the concern people have, and likely reactions in the media.All veterans and active service members should vigilant to signs of ID theft and requests for information, a good practice in any case.

Veterans Sue Over Loss Of Data
A group of veterans have filed a suit against the VA in U.S. District Court in Washington. They are seeking $1,000 in damages per person, ($26.5 billion).
They also
are asking for more stringent security procedures at the VA.The suit cites the 1974 Privacy Act, which applies to the federal government."The VA arrogantly compounded its disregard for veterans' privacy rights by recklessly failing to make even the most rudimentary effort to safeguard this trove of the personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure," the complaint claims.
