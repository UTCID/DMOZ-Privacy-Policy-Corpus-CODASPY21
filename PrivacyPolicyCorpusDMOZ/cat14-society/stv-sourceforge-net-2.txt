the voting process, OpaVote may record, for each voter, whether the voter has
voted, whether the voter has opted out of receiving election emails or
reported the election email as spam, the IP address used by the voter, and
other information provded in the HTTP headers (to deter fraudulent votes).

potential violations of the Terms and Conditions or other applicable law; and
publicize the fact that your organization used OpaVote along with
information about your election (e.g., date, election title, contest titles).
After an election manager deletes an election from OpaVote, all email
addresses, votes, and election results are permanently removed (except email
addresses of those who have opted out of receiving OpaVote emails or marked
an OpaVote email as spam, soley to prevent OpaVote from sending any further
messages to those email addresses).
