Please check the Agreement regularly when you enter the Site for any changes to this Agreement. The changes to the Agreement shall be effective immediately upon our posting a revised Agreement on the Site. Your use of the Site following the posting of any revised Agreement constitutes your agreement to be bound by those changes.
2. SITE CONTENT
All materials contained in the Patheos Site including, but not limited to, all images, text, software, illustrations, designs, logos, icons, video and audio content, and other materials and items on the Site, as well as the Site as a whole (collectively the "Content," which does not include any Member Content, discussed below), are owned, controlled and/or licensed by Patheos. The Content is protected by trademark, trade dress, copyright, and/or other intellectual property rights of Patheos or third-party licensors against any unauthorized uses not expressly permitted by this Agreement. All worldwide rights, title and interest in and to the Content are owned by Patheos or third-party licensors.
The Patheos Site and Content are intended solely for your personal informational and entertainment use. Patheos grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable license to print from your computer a single copy of the Content provided that you (i) use the Content for your personal, non-commercial use only, (ii) do not modify, remove or obscure any copyright and other proprietary notices, (iii) do not change the Content in any way, (iv) do not use any Content in a manner that suggests an association with Patheos, or any Patheos event, product, service, or brand, (v) do not copy, reproduce, republish, upload, download, post, transmit, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, sell or participate in any sale of, or exploit the Content in any way, and (vi) comply in all respects with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Unless you have satisfied all of the foregoing requirements, you may not print, download, copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, sell or participate in any sale of, or exploit in any way, in whole or in part, any of the Content or the Patheos Site without Patheos' prior written consent. Any use of the Content on any website other than the Patheos Site is strictly prohibited. We do not transfer to you title or any other rights in or to the Site or Content or any other materials on the Patheos Site not specifically set forth in this Agreement. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
3. MEMBER PARTICIPATION
You represent that you are at least 13 years of age and that the information you provide when registering on this Site is true, accurate, current and complete. The personal information you provide to us is governed by our Privacy Policy.
Patheos does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, graphics, sound, video, works of authorship or any other materials that you post on your member page or in forums, reviews, chatrooms or elsewhere on the Site (individually and collectively, "Member Content"). By posting your Member Content to the Site, you retain all ownership rights in your Member Content. By posting, submitting or otherwise exchanging Member Content on or through the Site, you acknowledge, agree and understand that (i) Member Content will not be considered or treated as confidential, (ii) others may see, read, use or re-transmit your Member Content, (iii) you explicitly represent and warrant that you are the sole owner of such Member Content or have all rights and licenses necessary regarding such Member Content and the grant of the License granted in the following paragraph iv, and (iv)that Patheos and the other members of the Site are thereby granted a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, unrestricted, world-wide, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, adapt, transform, distribute, transmit, broadcast, perform and display such Member Content in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum now known or hereafter developed for no compensation whatsoever (the "License"). This License includes a grant to Patheos and the Site and all other persons or entities involved in the operation of the Site of the right to transmit, monitor, retrieve, store, and use your Member Content. Patheos may sublicense its rights through multiple tiers of sublicenses. You may remove your Member Content from the Site, or terminate your membership with Patheos, but such removal or termination does not terminate the License to the extent that such Member Content may still be located on Patheos' or other members' computers, or located in other places not readily viewable on the current Site but accessible through archived files or bookmarked or undeleted text. Neither Patheos nor the Site assumes any responsibility or liability for any Member Content you provide, or any third parties' use or misuse of your Member Content.
4. RULES OF CONDUCT
As part of the Patheos community, you will be participating in a new dialogue about some of the most important topics in the world. And that new dialogue is:
A. Respectful and Elevated. Here we seek to better understand each other. That requires us to engage courteously and respectfully, even when we are engaging with someone with whom we fundamentally disagree.
B. Open, yet Safe. Anyone who desires to be part of the conversation can engage, but abuse will not be tolerated. Remember though: when you truly engage with someone from another faith, you often find that his or her world-view and yours are in conflict.
C. Honest and Real. At Patheos, we will often honestly express differences. And some of those differences, when it comes to different faiths, will seem false or even dangerous to you.
By using the Site in any way, you agree to the following:
A. You understand that all Member Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the member from whom such Member Content originated. This means that you, and not Patheos, are entirely responsible for all Member Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via Patheos.
B. Patheos does not control the Member Content posted via Patheos and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Member Content. You understand that by using Patheos, you may be exposed to Member Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Patheos be liable in any way for any Member Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Member Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Member Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via Patheos.
C. You agree not to use any part of the Patheos Site to:
i. aggressively and/or repeatedly attempt to proselytize or convert others to what you believe;
ii. to ask for money for yourself, for another individual, or for any for-profit cause;
iii. promote on-line or off-line sites, products or services;
iv. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Member Content that is unlawful, misleading, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invades another person's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable (as determined by Patheos in its sole discretion);violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others;

vi. encourage conduct that would violate this Agreement or any law or give rise to civil or criminal liability.

ix. forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Member Content transmitted through Patheos;
x. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Member Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
xi. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Member Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights of any party;
xii. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation, except in those areas (such as shopping) that are designated for such purpose (please read our complete Spam Policy);
xiii. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;
xiv. disrupt the normal flow of dialogue, cause a screen to "scroll" faster than other users of Patheos are able to type, or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects other users' ability to engage in real time exchanges;
xv. interfere with or disrupt Patheos or servers or networks connected to Patheos, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to Patheos or use the Patheos Site in a manner that damages, disables, overburdens or impairs the Patheos Site;
xvi. obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not authorized by this Agreement;
xvii. intentionally or unintentionally violates this Agreement or any applicable local, state, national or international law and any regulations having the force of law;
xviii. provide material support or resources (or conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources) to any organization(s) designated by the United States government as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;
xix. "stalk" or otherwise harass any other person or entity; and/or
xx. collect or store personal data about other members in connection with the prohibited conduct and activities set forth in paragraphs a through p above.

E. You may use your own personal community spaces (your MyPath profile and any Group you create) to promote your work, products, services and activities.

You may notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized, inappropriate or illegal Member Content or conduct on the Site. We have no obligation to remove any Content or Member Content from the Site and are not responsible for any delay in removing or failure to remove such Content or Member Content. Patheos may also terminate the rights of the person who contributed such Content or Member Content to access the Site and may bring legal action against such person.
