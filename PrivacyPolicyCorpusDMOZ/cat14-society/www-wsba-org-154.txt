Admission by Uniform Bar Exam Score Transfer
Updated: Nov. 30, 2020
Transferring a Uniform Bar Exam ScoreYou can take the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE) in any state and transfer a qualifying score (270 or higher) to Washington to use in the admission process, for up to 40 months after the date of the administration of the UBE in which the score was earned.; You must meet the qualifications for the lawyer bar examination under Washington Supreme Court APR 3(b) in order to qualify for admission in Washington using a transferred UBE score.You have 12 months from the date you submit your application for admission by UBE score transfer to complete the admission process using that application, including ensuring that Washington has received your qualifying UBE score. If you are not admitted within that 12 month period, you will be required to submit a new application and fee.  Because of this, some applicants may want to wait to submit their UBE score transfer application until they know they have earned a qualifying score of 270 or higher.Washington only accepts official UBE score transcripts in their entirety. We do not accept score transfers for the individual test components, nor do we allow applicants to register for select parts of the exam.The qualifying Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) score must be acquired no more than three years before or no later than 40 months after the date of the administration of the UBE in which the applicant achieves a passing score (APR 4(d)(2)). Contact the NCBE to make a request for official UBE and MPRE transcripts.Important Notice:We are currently working on upgrading our online admissions portal. Due to the upgrade, you must submit your UBE score transfer application by Jan. 14, 2021. If you do not, your application will be deleted and you will be required to start a new application beginning Jan. 15, 2021. Requirements for UBE TransferUBE transfer applicants may submit a completed application at anytime. Applicants must either:have a qualifying UBE transfer score at the time of application; orapply in Washington as a UBE score transfer applicant and in another UBE jurisdiction to take the UBE (you must inform us in your application of the state where you are taking the UBE), with the intent of transferring a qualifying score from that exam to Washington.  Any application for admission by UBE score transfer expires 12 months after the filing of the Washington application.NOTE: You are not permitted to apply at the same time for admission in Washington as both an applicant to take the exam in Washington and an applicant seeking to transfer a UBE score to Washington; you must choose one or the other.For UBE transfer applicants who are licensed in another jurisdiction, it takes approximately four to six months from the time an application is submitted for the application to be approved.For applicants who have never been admitted in another jurisdiction, it takes approximately two to three months from the time an application is submitted for the application to be approved, assuming Washington has received the qualifying transferred UBE score.Once the application is approved, applicants will receive an email notification.Note: You have one year from the date of submitting your UBE score transfer application to complete the admission process (APR 5(e)(1)), which includes ensuring Washington has received your transferred qualifying UBE score. After one year, you will need to submit a new application and fee, and the 12 month period to complete the process will start running again. You may withdraw your application at any time subject to a $300 non-refundable administrative fee. Fees paid to the NCBE are also non-refundable.Questions about transferring a UBE score to Washington should be directed to admissions@wsba.org or 206-727-8209.
Please Note : All applicants are subject to a character and fitness review prior to being admitted to practice law in Washington.  Factors considered by Admissions staff and Bar Counsel when determining whether an applicant should be referred to the Character and Fitness Board are set forth in Washington Supreme Court Admission and Practice Rules (APR)  20-24.2(a).
Any discrepancy or conflict between the information provided here and the rules and regulations set by the Washington Supreme Court, or the Bylaws and policies of the Washington State Bar Association, is unintentional and will be resolved in favor of strict compliance with the rules, regulations, Bylaws and policies.
