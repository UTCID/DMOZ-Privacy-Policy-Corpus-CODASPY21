1. Change of mind returns – what returns we accept and under what conditions
1.1 Australia Post will only accept change of mind returns for the following goods:
(a) philatelic products (but not MyStamp stamps or Personalised Stamps);
(b) coin collectables; and
(c) postage items like Express Post satchels, Parcel Post satchels, Registered Post envelopes (but not boxes and other packaging materials).
1.2 If you wish to return one of these goods because you have changed your mind, Australia Post will offer you a full refund provided that:
(a) you return the goods within 60 days of purchase;
(b) you return the goods to the outlet where they were purchased (see section, ‘Where to return your item’ below if you are unable to return to the same outlet or you purchased the goods from Australia Post’s online Shop);
(c) you provide adequate proof of purchase (meaning your Australia Post receipt or another suitable proof of purchase, like a bank statement or credit card statement);
(d) the goods are in a re-saleable condition (meaning they are in the original packaging, unopened and in original condition); and
(e) if the goods form part of a set / bundle you return the full set / bundle (if goods sold in sets / bundles can be purchased separately, and you want some but not all items from the set / bundle, you can separately purchase or place a new order for the items you require).
2. No other change of mind returns
Australia Post does not accept ‘change of mind’ returns or exchanges for any goods outside of those categories mentioned above.
3. Your rights – Return of goods not meeting consumer guarantees
3.1 The Australian Consumer Law gives consumers broad rights, known as consumer guarantees. The consumer guarantees apply to any goods they purchase.
3.2 The consumer guarantees mean all goods sold by Australia Post must be:
(a) fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly supplied;
(b) acceptable in appearance and finish;
(c) free from defects;
(d) safe; and
(e) durable.
3.3 The consumer guarantees also mean that if goods you have purchased from Australia Post are:
(a) faulty;
(b) incorrectly described;
(c) different from a sample shown;
(d) not able to do what we said they would do; or
(e) not of an acceptable quality,
you may return the goods to us within a reasonable time after purchase.
4. What we will do when you ask to return goods to us because they do not meet the consumer guarantees
4.1 Where you believe goods purchased from Australia Post do not meet a consumer guarantee, you should return the goods to the outlet where they were purchased (see section, ‘Where to return your item’ below if you are unable to return to the same outlet or you purchased the goods from Australia Post’s online Shop), and our staff will either:
(a) assess the goods and the cause of the problem ‘in store’; or
(b) where it is considered necessary, arrange for the manufacturer (or the manufacturer’s repair agent) to assess the goods and the cause of the problem (you will need to pay the costs associated with sending; however, postage or reasonable transportation costs may be recoverable if goods are assessed as having a failure – so keep your proof of purchase for the postage).
4.2 The ACCC provides guidance on what is a ‘major failure’ and what is a ‘minor failure’. Goods will be considered to have a ‘major failure’ when:
(a) the problem would have stopped you from buying the goods had you known about it;
(b) the goods are significantly different from a sample or description;
(c) the goods are substantially unfit for their common purpose and can’t easily be fixed within a reasonable time;
(d) the goods don’t do what you asked for and can’t easily be fixed within a reasonable time; or
(e) the goods are unsafe.
4.3 Failures not considered to be ‘major’ will be classified as ‘minor’ failures.
4.4 If the goods are assessed by us or the manufacturer as not meeting a consumer guarantee:
(a) where the failure is assessed as ‘major’, you can choose:
(i) to return the goods and receive a refund of the purchase price; or;
(ii) to keep the goods and accept a partial refund of the purchase price (where we can agree with you what a reasonable amount is to reflect a reduction in value of the goods); or
(iii) to replace the goods with an identical item.
(b) where the failure is assessed as ‘minor’, we will arrange for the manufacturer to repair the goods for you within a reasonable time frame (or, at our discretion, we may replace the goods or refund you).
4.5 Alternatively, you may wish to contact the manufacturer of the goods directly yourself. If you choose to do this, we can:
(a) assist you in identifying the manufacturer; and
(b) assist you with preparing the goods for sending to the manufacturer (you will need to pay the costs associated with sending; however, postage or reasonable transportation costs may be recoverable if goods are assessed as having a failure – so keep your proof of purchase for the postage).
4.6 Australia Post reserves the right not to offer an exchange, repair, replacement or refund where the fault is a result of misuse, or the goods are damaged after you have purchased and taken possession of it.
5. Additional requirements for telecommunication goods returned
5.1 Australia Post is a licensed supplier of telecommunications products, including mobile phones.
5.2 How Australia Post will deal with the return of a mobile phone will depend on whether the fault occurred within or outside of the Dead on Arrival1 / Early Life Failure2 period set by the relevant manufacturer (see table).

1 'Dead on Arrival' eans the mobile phone has never worked.
2 'Early Life Failure' means the mobile phone stopped working shortly after you bought it.
5.3 Return process where a faulty mobile phone is within the applicable Dead on Arrival / Early Life Failure period
(a) Where the mobile phone is confirmed as within the manufacturer’s Dead on Arrival/Early Life Failure Period, Australia Post will:
(i) Ask you for a description of the fault.
(ii) If applicable, ask that you unlock the mobile phone and remove the lock code.
(iii) Assess the mobile phone (in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines) to determine whether it is Dead on Arrival / Early Life Failure.
(iv) Where we determine the item to be Dead on Arrival / Early Life Failure, we will process a refund or a replacement.
(b) Australia Post reserves the right not to offer a refund or replacement where the fault is a result of misuse.
5.4 Return Process where a faulty mobile phone is outside the applicable Dead on Arrival / Early Life Failure period
(a) Where the mobile phone is confirmed as outside the manufacturer’s Dead on Arrival / Early Life Failure period, the fault will need to be assessed by that manufacturer before a repair, replacement or refund can be authorised and processed.
(b) Our staff can arrange for the manufacturer (or the manufacturer’s repair agent) to assess the cause of the problem. If you would like our support to arrange this, we will:
(i) obtain the following details from you:
• your contact details (name, address, phone number and email address);
• the IMEI / serial number on the item; and
• a description of the fault,
(ii) assist you in the return of the mobile phone to the manufacturer for assessment (you will need to pay the costs associated with sending; however, postage or reasonable transportation costs may recoverable if goods are assessed as having a failure – so keep your proof of purchase for postage).
(c) The manufacturer will notify you directly with the outcome of their assessment. If they determine the mobile phone to be faulty, they will assess whether the fault is minor and can be repaired. If the fault is major, or otherwise the mobile phone cannot be repaired, the manufacturer will work out with you whether you would like a replacement or a refund. If it is determined there is no fault, the mobile phone will be returned to you.
5.5 You will need to provide all accessories that came with the mobile phone.
5.6 Alternatively, you may wish to contact the manufacturer of the mobile phone directly yourself.
6. Proof of purchase
Your request to refund, replace or repair must be accompanied by proof of purchase. If you can't provide your Australia Post receipt, another form of proof of purchase will be required, such as a credit card statement, which clearly shows that the purchase was from Australia Post.
7. Where to return your item
7.1 You should return the goods to the post office where you bought them. If you cannot return the goods to the post office where you bought them, please phone 13 13 18 for assistance.
7.2 If you purchased the goods from the Australia Post online Shop, please phone 13 76 78 for assistance.
8. Bundled items
Where the goods being returned were purchased as part of a bundled offer, all items within the bundle must be returned.
9. Refund method
Refunds will be issued using the same payment method as that used for your original purchase.
10. Need more help?
