The NAI serves as the leading voice of digital advertising companies and third-party advertisers in public policy discussions before the U.S. government, states, and governments around the world. We are committed to promoting public policies that balance strong consumer privacy protections with consumer demands for a vibrant digital content ecosystem, supported by innovative digital advertising.
To that end, the NAI also works closely with member companies to facilitate cooperation around key legal and compliance issues, and to develop analysis to enhance NAI members’ understanding of various legal requirements as they apply to the digital advertising ecosystem.
The NAI also continues to be a champion of strong industry self-regulation and co-regulation, whereby industry efforts can play a complimentary role to new regulations as a means of supplementing and enhancing new regulations as a method for companies to demonstrate their compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements.
