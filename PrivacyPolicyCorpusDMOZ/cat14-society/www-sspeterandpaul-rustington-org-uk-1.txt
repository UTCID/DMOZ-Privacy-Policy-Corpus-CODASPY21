Due to a change in the law, the PCC of St Peter and St Paul require your consent to store and use your
data.
The uses of data that affect all members of the congregation are the Church Family Directory, the Pastoral
Visitors List and the Electoral Roll. This means that you will need to give your consent to be
included in these documents.  Please ask for a form. These need to be returned either to
church or to the Church Office if you wish your name to remain on the documents.
The PCC Privacy
Notice, which outlines the responsibilities of the PCC with regards to data, can be accessed by clicking on the 'GDPR Privacy Notice 070618' file below. A  printed
copy will also be put on the notice board in church by the West Door.
