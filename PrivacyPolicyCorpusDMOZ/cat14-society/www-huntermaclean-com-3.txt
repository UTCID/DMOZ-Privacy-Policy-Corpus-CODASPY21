Hunter Maclean Exley & Dunn P.C. recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy rights and interests of visitors to this Web site and is committed to respecting those rights.
We do not sell, divulge, give or release any information relating to visitors to this Web site.
E-mails, like other communications to the law firm or its attorneys, are not confidential unless an attorney-client relationship has been agreed to in writing. While we would like to hear from you, we cannot represent you until we know that doing so will not create a conflict of interest. Accordingly, please do not send us any information about any matter that may involve you until you receive a written statement from us that we represent you (an “Engagement Letter”). When you receive an Engagement Letter from the firm, you will be our client, and we may exchange information freely.
Our service provider has a secure system with state of the art firewall protection features. Nevertheless, visitors are advised that communication by e-mail is not necessarily secure. Visitors are advised to use judgment and caution when discussing or divulging confidential information through email communications that may be viewed by unintended parties.
This privacy policy applies only to the Hunter Maclean Exley & Dunn Web site. This Web site provides links to other Web sites and visitors are advised that this policy does not apply to any Web site for which a link is provided
