The Alliance Française de Brisbane will only collect personal information from you with your prior knowledge and consent. You can

Top-level of your domain name;

No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law

Navigation data
Browsing any website – including the Alliance Française de Brisbane website – generates a trail of pages visited and the
time apparently spent displaying each page.

We seek feedback from our users in order to improve the service offered by the site. Answering feedback questions is voluntary and does not
in any way affect your access to the Alliance Française de Brisbane website.

purposes. When the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected it is deleted.
The data is used by the Alliance Française de Brisbane website software, and by staff involved in the operations, only for:
