Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Vehar Law PC collects non-personally-identifying information of the

publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Vehar Law PC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on veharlawpc.com

commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
