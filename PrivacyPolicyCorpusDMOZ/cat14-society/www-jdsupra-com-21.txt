Please join us for our annual exploration of cutting-edge legal, business, and technology issues in Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and the Cloud as these sectors become the most active and important for technology law and policy. As with many events this year, we have adapted our standard day-long conference to be a 2 and a half-hour webinar of virtual presentations. The day will include our annual exploration of the latest in government secrecy and surveillance, and a new session on litigation developments in copyright law. We will continue exploring growing issues related to AI and biometrics, and take deep dives on how to best align the evolving California consumer privacy law with state, federal US and EU activity into a coherent privacy framework.
Full agenda and speakers to be announced soon. Sign up now for one of the most popular CLEs of the season!
