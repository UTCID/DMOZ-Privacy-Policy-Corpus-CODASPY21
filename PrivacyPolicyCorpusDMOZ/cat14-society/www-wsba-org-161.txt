These requirements are described in the Washington Supreme Court's Limited License Legal Technician Rules of Professional Conduct.Reporting Ethical ViolationsIf you think a legal technician has committed an ethics violation and would like to report it, use this form.If you would like to report a lawyer’s violation of the Washington Supreme Court's Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers, please visit this page.Grievance ProcessIf a grievance is filed against a legal technician, staff at the WSBA and the chair of the LLLT Board's Discipline Committee will review the allegations. Some grievances may be dismissed after initial review, especially if they are found to be erroneous or irrelevant to the code of conduct described in the Washington Supreme Court's Limited License Technician Rules of Professional Conduct. Other grievances will be investigated by disciplinary counsel at the WSBA. Disciplinary counsel may recommend dismissal of the grievance or a hearing that could result in suspension or revocation of licenses based on an evaluation of the grievance and the evidence supporting it. The legal technician will have the opportunity to present their side of the story both during an investigation and at a disciplinary hearing if one is ordered.The Discipline Committee of the LLLT Board will conduct the hearing and make a recommendation about whether or not to dismiss the case, order sanctions, or revoke the license of the LLLT. Any decision to suspend or revoke the license will ultimately be made by the Washington Supreme Court.Legal technicians may appeal the decisions and recommendations of the Discipline Committee of the LLLT Board up to the Washington Supreme Court.Please email the LLLT Program Lead or call 206-727-8289 with any questions regarding the grievance process.
