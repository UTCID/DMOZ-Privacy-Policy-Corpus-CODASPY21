For a child, like sixteen-year-old Willow who's living with Aicardi syndrome, a condition that causes developmental delay and seizures, life can often be filled with endless medical appointments, gruelling treatment and long periods of time in hospital away from their friends and family. This is a far cry from the carefree childhood they should be enjoying.
With your support we're helping to grant life-changing wishes that enable a child to look past their illness and give them hope for the future.
£7 could buy a seriously ill child a bucket and spade so they can play in the sand with their siblings on their holiday wish.£10 could help buy cupcakes for a child who wishes to have a tea party with their favourite TV character. £15 could help buy furnishings for a child who wishes for a transformational bedroom makeover. £20 could help buy dinner for a child whose wish is to go to London to spend the day with their family seeing the sights. £30 could help dress a little princess or firefighter in their very own costume for their magical wish. £50 could help buy a football shirt for a child to look the part on their wish to watch their favourite team play. £80 could help buy a sensory toy to stimulate the sense of a non-communicative wish child as part of their bedroom makeover. £100 could help pay for a teenager to have a makeup makeover on their wish to have a confidence-boosting experience. £150 could help buy tickets for a child who wishes to see a London theatre show. Donate nowand help us grant life-changing wishes to children with critical illnesses.

"Willow is the bravest, most resilient and sweethearted person. She is incredible, and music gets to her in a way that nothing else does. Seeing Willow happy has been the best thing today. I would like to thank Make-A-Wish wholeheartedly for making this happen. They make wishes come true and that’s phenomenal. Thank you to all the people who gave up their time and generosity."
Viv, Wish child, Willow's mum
