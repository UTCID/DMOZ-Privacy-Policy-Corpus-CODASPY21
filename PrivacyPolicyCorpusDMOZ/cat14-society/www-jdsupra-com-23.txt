In this episode, we talk about the importance of seeing your compliance program through the government’s eyes. The DOJ Fraud Section recently released its latest update to their guidance on evaluation of corporate compliance programs. While it does not represent a major rewrite, it did provide further clarity on the government’s expectations on post-merger integration, continuous program improvement and compliance’s access to relevant data sources needed to drive the program.
