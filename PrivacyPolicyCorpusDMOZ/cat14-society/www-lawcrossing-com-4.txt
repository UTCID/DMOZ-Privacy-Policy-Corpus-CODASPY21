LawCrossing Terms of Use
By signing up for a LawCrossing membership you acknowledge and agree to the following Terms of Use:
Your user names and password must not be distributed to others. This will result in immediate termination of service.
LawCrossing has the right to refuse membership or cancel membership at any time for any reason. Your membership fees are non-refundable.
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service. The material on the Service is for the private, non-commercial enjoyment of members only. Any other use is prohibited.
LawCrossing currently (a) provides members with access to jobs that are provided to the site through various means and aggregated on the site for members to view, (b) collects various articles for users to view about topics relevant to their careers, (c) provides mechanisms for users to store application materials for legal jobs, and (d) allows users to apply to various positions online.
While LawCrossing makes every effort to only list jobs which employers may want those in the legal community to know about, we are not responsible for the accuracy of our jobs and/or the contact information for those jobs and any consequences to our users that may follow from them applying to given jobs listed on the LawCrossing website. The inclusion of links on this site does not constitute an endorsement of the employer or a guarantee that a job even exists with a given employer. LawCrossing assumes no liability whatsoever for the quality or legality of the jobs posted on its site, or whether or not employers are actually able to hire a candidate in response to a given job listing. Furthermore, LawCrossing does not censor any position offered including, but not limited to, the identity of the employer.
LawCrossing may assist you in emailing a resume, cover letter and supporting materials in pursuit of an application to an employer, or writing a letter to an employer indicating you have an interest in a particular position or employment with the employer. While we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of our job application process, LawCrossing assumes no liability for the quality, legality or accuracy of your resume, cover letter, or supporting materials or our assistance in helping you transmit any of this information to an employer.
THIS SITE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THE MATERIALS AND INFORMATION FOUND ON THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY FOR INFORMATION, SERVICES, OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SITE AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
LawCrossing DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. LawCrossing DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS SITE IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY APPLIES TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, ACT OF GOD/ACT OF NATURE, COMMUNICATION LINE FAILURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, OR USE OF RECORD, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS BEHAVIOR, NEGLIGENCE, OR UNDER ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION.
AS A LAWCROSSING MEMBER, YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR A MEMBERSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAWCROSSING'S MEMBERSHIP FEE. IF YOU ARE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIBER, AS OF THIS DATE THE MEMBERSHIP FEE IS $39.95 PER MONTH. YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY BILLED EACH MONTH, UNTIL AND UNLESS YOU CONTACT US BY TELEPHONE TO CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP. YOU WILL BE BILLED $1 FOR 7 DAYS OF ACCESS. AFTER THE 7 DAYS, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP. AFTER THE TRIAL PERIOD, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AT ANY TIME, BUT YOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND FOR ANY UNUSED PORTION REMAINING ON YOUR ACCOUNT.
YOU MUST CANCEL BEFORE YOUR NEXT BILLING DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID A CHARGE FOR THE FOLLOWING MONTH-LONG PERIOD. IF YOUR BILLING DATE FALLS ON A WEEKEND OR LEGAL U.S. HOLIDAY, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CALL ON A WEEKDAY PRIOR TO YOUR BILLING DATE. YOUR BILLING DATE REFLECTS THE DATE YOUR MEMBERSHIP WITH LAWCROSSING WAS INITIATED. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP WITH LAWCROSSING BY CALLING US AT OUR DIRECT LINE AT (800) 973-1177 BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 8:00 A.M. AND 4:00 P.M. (PACIFIC STANDARD TIME), MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY (EXCLUDING HOLIDAYS), AND SPEAK WITH ONE OF OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES TO TELL US YOU NO LONGER WISH TO BE CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE. LAWCROSSING RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE MEMBERSHIP FEES AT ANY TIME. YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO LAWCROSSING WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED EVERY MONTH, UNLESS LAWCROSSING IS NOTIFIED BY PHONE. UNTIL YOU TERMINATE YOUR MEMBERSHIP, YOU AUTHORIZE OUR BILLING COMPANY (VERISIGN) TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD (OR OTHER APPROVED FACILITY OR MECHANISM) FOR THE ONGOING SUBSCRIPTION FEE.
IN ADDITION TO MONTHLY MEMBERSHIPS, LAWCROSSING OFFERS THE OPTION OF SIGNING UP FOR DISCOUNTED MEMBERSHIPS THAT ARE BILLED EVERY THREE MONTHS, EVERY SIX MONTHS OR EVERY YEAR. THE CURRENT FEES FOR SUCH MEMBERSHIPS ARE $129.95, $219.95, AND $369.95 RESPECTIVELY. EXCEPT FOR (A) THE DURATION OF THE RECURRING BILLING PERIOD AND (B) THE PERIODIC FEES, THE TERMS FOR SUCH MEMBERSHIPS ARE THE SAME AS FOR MONTHLY MEMBERSHIPS AS DESCRIBED IN THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE.
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR LAWCROSSING WITH A PROMOTION CODE THAT OFFERS FREE ACCESS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR THE SPECIFIED PERIOD, ALLOWING YOU FREE AND UNLIMITED ACCESS DURING THAT PERIOD. IF THE PROMOTION REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT PAYMENT INFORMATION, YOUR CREDIT CARD WILL BE CHARGED ON THE DAY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE SPECIFIED PERIOD, UNLESS YOU CALL US DURING THE PROMOTION PERIOD TO CANCEL AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO BE BILLED THEREAFTER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SIGN UP WITH A 14-DAY FREE TRIAL OFFER, YOU WILL BE BILLED THE PERIODIC FEE ON THE 15TH DAY, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE BILLED THE PERIODIC FEE EACH BILLING PERIOD THEREAFTER. ANY FREE TRIAL OFFER ASSOCIATED WITH LAWCROSSING ENTITLES NEW SUBSCRIBERS TO A ONE-TIME FREE TRIAL USAGE OF THE SERVICE. BY SIGNING UP FOR LAWCROSSING WITH A PROMOTION CODE OFFERING FREE ACCESS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD AND SUBMITTING PAYMENT INFORMATION, YOU SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD FOR THE PERIODIC FEES UNDER WHICH YOU HAVE SIGNED UP, BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE END OF THE SPECIFIED PROMOTION PERIOD. IF YOU WISH TO TERMINATE THE TRIAL AND DO NOT WISH TO BE BILLED ON A RECURRING BASIS, YOU MUST CALL TO CANCEL BEFORE THE END OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
Please inform LawCrossing of any of the following changes in your credit card or debit account: Change in home or billing address or other contact information; card loss or theft or unauthorized usage of the card; or apparent breach of security of username or password, such that unauthorized access to the LawCrossing service via the card is possible. Unless you give proper notice to LawCrossing of any such event, you agree to pay all charges for unauthorized use of the service.
In addition, LawCrossing shall not be responsible for any bank overdraft fees, charges for exceeding credit limits, or any other fees or charges that may be imposed by your bank or credit card company.
If your credit or debit card is declined for any reason, you will be sent an invoice for the amount due, and you agree to pay that invoice. This invoice is payable by contacting our Customer Service Department during their stated hours of operation, or by sending remittance by check to:
LawCrossing
20 S. Altadena Dr.,
Suite 102,
Pasadena, CA 91107
Should your check payment of your outstanding invoiced balance be returned unpaid for any reason (non-sufficient funds, account closure, etc.) LawCrossing will assess a per-check fee of $40.00, regardless of the check's written amount. You agree to pay this penalty if your check is unable to be deposited. LawCrossing assumes no responsibility for fees, charges, or any other penalty that may be imposed by your bank as a result of an unpaid check.
