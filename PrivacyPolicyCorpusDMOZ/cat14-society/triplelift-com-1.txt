Cookies and similar technologies
We use cookies in connection with our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we store on your computer’s or mobile device’s memory. Cookies help us better understand the effectiveness of an ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you respond to, select and interact with an Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view an Ad, and for managing the frequency in which you see particular ads). Some cookies help you navigate our Services, including setting a cookie to remember your login details. Other cookies collect information about how you use our Services, which highlights areas we can improve, including navigation. If you submit an inquiry through our website and provide your name and email and similar information, that personal information will not be tied back to you for interest-based advertising purposes across websites and applications, however, you may receive email marketing communications from us. To opt out of marketing communications, see “Choices.”
We may also use “pixel tags” “web beacons”, “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) to analyze usage patterns of consumers. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page or in a mobile application and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Some Pixel Tags are used to drop cookies on users’ devices. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain websites and applications of our publisher clients, and pages within such websites and applications, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
Cookies and Pixel Tags also help us operate and improve our Services, including to verify legitimacy of traffic, and to help us send you personalized, targeted Ads that you see because of information collected through such Pixel Tags and stored within your cookie embedded on your device(s). To opt out of interest-based advertising see “Choices.”
Third parties may also use cookies or similar technologies on visitors of our websites to serve interest-based advertisements to such visitors when they visit other websites and mobile applications, including advertisements promoting our Services.
Publishers, advertisers and advertising partners that participate in the Services may also utilize cookies or similar technologies to deliver ads and monitor the performance of such ads. The collection of information through cookies or similar technologies by such third parties will be governed by their own privacy policies and principles, which TripleLift does not control.
Your browser may offer tools to enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, please note that certain features of the TripleLift Pages may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Moreover, if you delete cookies after previously opting out of TripleLift’s platform practices, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
For more information about cookies and your choices regarding cookies, see “Choices.”
At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” headers and similar mechanisms.

Legal basis relied on for processing personal information of European economic area individuals
TripleLift is a data processor with respect to personal data collected or received by us when we receive such information from our advertiser clients and data providers that make their data available for use via our Services. Where we operate as a data processor, we are processing the data on behalf of our clients (the data controller(s) of the data) based on their instructions, and it is the responsibility of the data controller to establish an appropriate legal basis for the processing of the data. For example, we may process data when it is in our clients’ and our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights. Those legitimate interests include performing our obligations with respect to providing the Services and improving our Services. On certain occasions we may rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information, as determined by our clients.
TripleLift is a data controller with respect to any personal data collected or received by us (1) when we receive personal information through our TripleLift Pages, (2) when we operate our advertising bidder or our buying-related Services with which we send advertising bid requests and (3) with respect to personal data collected or received by us when we receive such information from our publisher clients that make their data available via our Services. In such cases, the data controller is Triple Lift, Inc. Where TripleLift operates as a data controller, we rely on  different legal bases depending on the purpose for which we process the data including legitimate interests and on certain occasions, we may also rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information as a controller. On other occasions, we may process personal information when we need to do this to fulfill a contract or where we are required to do so by law.

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests deletion in accordance with applicable law.

Third parties
This Privacy Policy does not cover, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, data or other practices of any third parties (except as required by applicable law), including any third parties operating any site or service to which our Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies.
We are also not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of our publisher clients, our advertising clients such as demand side platforms, data management platforms, app developers, app providers, ad servers, social media platform providers, operating system providers, wireless service providers or device manufacturers (except as required by applicable law), including any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Services.

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose to us, any sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers or other government identifiers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, medical or health conditions, criminal background, trade union membership, or sexual orientation) on or through the Services or otherwise to us, except where such information is legally required.
Security
Information that we collect is stored using procedures and practices reasonably designed to help protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by us.
Use of services by minors
Our Services are not intended for, nor directed to, individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that these individuals, and any other individual considered a minor under applicable law, do not provide personal information through any of the Services.
International information transfers
Please be aware that the information we collect, may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. Please be advised that we process and store information in any country where we have facilities and/or employees, including the United States, or in which we engage service providers. Your consent to this Privacy Policy or your use of any of the Services or your submission of your information to us or any of our publisher clients, represents your consent to such transfer, storage and processing outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country of residence.
EEA-US Data Transfers
We transfer data, if any, from the EEA or Switzerland to the US under a valid transfer mechanism. If there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and such mechanism, the terms of the transfer mechanism shall govern.  If we receive data and transfer it on to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the third party’s processing of the data is in accordance with a valid legal framework.
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and SWISS-U.S Privacy Shield Compliance and Status
On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement declaring EU-US Privacy Shield Framework invalid. We now rely on other transfer mechanisms for the cross-border transfer of data. However, TripleLift has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework and continues to comply with its obligations under the program. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield Framework, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Please click here for more information or to submit a complaint.
Triple Lift, Inc. is accountable for information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party. Triple Lift, Inc. may transfer personal information collected from the TripleLift Pages as described above in this Privacy Policy. Triple Lift, Inc. may also transfer other information which meet the definition of “personal data” in the Privacy Shield Framework to service providers and to its clients such as publishers, ad partners, and ad agencies including for interest-based advertising as described above. If we share personal data of European Economic Area individuals (including the United Kingdom and Switzerland) with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of such data in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Triple Lift, Inc. commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information of European Economic Area individuals including the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Such individuals who have inquiries or complaints under the Privacy Shield Frameworks should first contact TripleLift at privacy ((at))triplelift((dot))com or:

The services of the ICDR are provided at no cost to you.
Under certain conditions, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
