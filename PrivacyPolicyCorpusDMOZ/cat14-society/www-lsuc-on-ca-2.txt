2020-21 Online Licensing Examinations
*Fall and Winter dates added in August 2020
The Law Society is moving forward with online delivery of all licensing examinations until the end of March 2021. As public health measures regarding social distancing remain in place indefinitely, all in-person delivery of examinations has been cancelled and will be replaced by online examination delivery until the end of March 2021. The Law Society continues to actively monitor the public health situation and will communicate delivery plans for 2021-22 licensing year examinations in early 2021.
Candidates should read this webpage in its entirety, including the FAQs, to ensure that they have the necessary information to write an examination online. The examination results release dates listed are the latest dates that results will be released. We strive to exceed these dates whenever possible.

Registration
Candidates who are not already registered (eligible) to write an upcoming examination must first ensure that they have paid the study materials fee and the examination fee before the registration deadline. If a candidate would like to write the examination and has not been invoiced for these fees, the candidate should submit a Registration or Deferment- Online Examinations form (for Lawyers) (for Paralegals) to Licensing and Accreditation through the candidate’s online account as soon as possible and no later than several business days before the applicable registration date. This will ensure the candidates’ account is updated with their examination sitting selection as well as invoiced accordingly. Once the candidate is invoiced, they are required to pay fees on or before the applicable registration deadline in order to complete registration for a sitting.
If a candidate does not register and pay by the applicable registration deadline, they must defer to the next available sitting.
Reduction in Length of the 2020-21 Licensing Process Year Examinations
All 2020-21 licensing process year examinations have been temporarily reduced in length from 7 hours to 4 hours. Barrister, solicitor and paralegal examinations in the 2020-21 licensing year continue to be multiple-choice and open book, but will be 4 hours long and made up of 160 multiple-choice questions.
The reduction in length was implemented to facilitate the transition to online delivery and was enabled through prioritizing competencies that are most relevant to effective and ethical practice and public protection.
The processes to prioritize the competencies and reduce the length of the examinations was supported by psychometricians to ensure continued defensibility. All licensing examinations continue to assess entry level competence for the lawyer and paralegal professions and continue to cover the most critical substantive law, procedural law, professional responsibility and practice management concepts.

The Law Society’s service providers for the online examinations are Paradigm Testing and MonitorEDU who partner to administer the examination software and remote proctoring, respectively. Both providers follow industry best practices in compliance with standards defined by international accrediting bodies such as ISO/ANSI 17024.
Licensing examinations in the 2020-21 licensing process year will be 4 hours in length and written on one day within a 5-day test window between the hours of 8:00 am and 8:00 pm EST/EDT.
The online licensing examinations will be delivered to candidates on their laptop or desktop computer. The delivery will be provided through a secure, browser-based platform that locks down the computer from accessing anything except for the examination. A live Proctor will verify candidate identification and closely monitor candidates during the administration of the examination through audio and live video streaming via two cameras: a computer webcam and a smartphone camera. The smartphone’s setting must be on “do not disturb” during the examination with the camera functioning.
For more information, watch the video about remote proctoring and review the sample online examination. The YouTube video is provided in English by a Law Society licensing examination service provider, MonitorEDU. Candidates may access French captioning by clicking on the settings wheel and selecting French (Canada) subtitles/CC.
On examination day, candidates will be required to accept a Candidate Agreement before they can begin writing the examination. Candidates are required to review the Candidate Agreement prior to their examination.

If candidates have questions about the technical requirements, they are encouraged to contact MonitorEDU through the 24/7 live chat line at https://monitoredu.com/live-chat. Candidates must  conduct a supported pre-check of their equipment with MonitorEDU at least five days prior to their scheduled examination.
If a candidate is unable to meet the technology requirements for the online examination delivery, the candidate may contact the Law Society to request assistance through the candidate’s online account at least 20 business days before the start of Test Window 1 of the candidate’s examination sitting. Seeking assistance from the Law Society should be a last resort. If the Law Society determines that the request is appropriate, the candidate will be sent a form to complete. This form is required to be completed and submitted within 2 business days of the date that the form was sent to the candidate.
While the Law Society does not guarantee that assistance can be obtained, the Law Society will make reasonable efforts to assist candidates in meeting the technology requirements. Candidates should note that the Law Society has a limited amount of laptop equipment available to lend to candidates and should be aware that their scheduled date to write the examination may be impacted by the laptop inventory available and the required shipping time. Candidates will be required to enter into a laptop borrowing agreement prior to receiving laptop equipment.
Rules and Protocol
While many of the rules and protocols for online delivery are the same as for the in-person delivery of the licensing examinations, additional security measures are in place to protect the integrity of the examination and preserve a standardized experience as much as possible.
Candidates must review the Rules and Protocol (for Lawyers or for Paralegals) including those applicable to online examinations before they write their examination.
Candidates should also review the Guide to Licensing Examinations (for Lawyers or for Paralegals) for tips on preparing to write the examination and for strategies for reviewing the study materials.
Testing Area
In order to support successful completion of the licensing examination, candidates are required to ensure the testing area is and will remain comfortable, quiet, and free of distractions during the scheduled examination. Candidates need to ensure that they set the best conditions for themselves to write the examination. Below are conditions for an acceptable testing area:
There is a clear desk or tabletop
There is a comfortable chair
Only the Permitted Items listed below are within the candidate’s reach
The areas beneath the desk and chair are clear
The walls immediately behind where the Licensing Examination is taken are clear
The computer and smartphone are plugged in for the duration of the examination
The candidate has within reach a six-foot extension cord and uses it as required by the Proctor to move the computer and smartphone
There is adequate lighting and the room is at a comfortable temperature
There is no noise from outside of the testing area (e.g., television, conversation) that would interfere with the candidate’s ability to write the examination or the ability of the Proctor to monitor the examination and communicate with the candidate
Landlines, non-required electronics and any security or recording devices in the room are turned off and never accessed by the candidate during the duration of the examination and break
A sign has been placed on the door(s) of the testing area, if any
No one enters the testing area during the examination (other than, e.g., for a moment as a result of inadvertence)
The Law Society understands that some candidates may not have access to a quiet or private room in which to take an examination, particularly during the COVID-19 situation. However, candidates are still responsible for securing a testing area that meets the requirements for writing the online examination, and the Law Society expects that candidates will make all possible efforts and exhaust all options that are available to them to secure an appropriate testing area for their licensing examination. Seeking assistance from the Law Society should be a last resort.
If a candidate is unable to secure an appropriate testing area, the candidate may contact the Law Society to request assistance through the candidate’s online account at least 20 business days before the start of Test Window 1 of the candidate’s examination sitting. If the Law Society determines that the request is appropriate, the candidate will be sent a form to complete. This form is required to be completed and submitted within 2 business days of the date that the form was sent to the candidate.
While the Law Society does not guarantee that assistance can be obtained, the Law Society will make reasonable efforts to provide the candidate with at least one contact that may be willing to offer an appropriate testing area for the candidate to write the online examination. If one or more testing area contacts have been forwarded to the candidate, it is the candidate’s sole responsibility to coordinate use of the testing area with that contact. Please note that any testing area contacts may be provided to more than one candidate as there may be multiple candidates who have requested assistance in locating an appropriate testing area.

Step-by-Step Process to Write an Online Examination
Once registered with the Law Society to write the examination, below are the steps that candidates must follow to write the examination.
Step 1:  Schedule the Date and Time to Write the Examination
At least 4 weeks before the first test window, candidates will be notified by the Law Society of their eligibility to write an examination through their online account. This message will include the link to schedule the online exam.  There are limited slots available for each day and time.
Candidates must ensure that their personal email on file with the Law Society is correct and that their email is set up to allow emails from @monitoredu.com.
The 5-day test windows run from Tuesday to Saturday.  Please note that there are no examination dates available on Canadian statutory holidays. Examination time slots are in the morning or afternoon. An additional 15 minutes has been added to the time slots to allow time for pre-examination check-ins and post-examination procedures. The allotted time to write the examination is 4 hours plus a 30-minute scheduled break between the two parts of the examination.
Step 2:  Complete requirements to write the online examination
A minimum of 5 days prior to examination day, candidates’ hardware and software requirements and Internet bandwidth must be pre-checked with MonitorEDU to verify equipment and Internet bandwidth . The pre-check is a requirement to write the examination. It is important to verify that the computer that will be used is compatible, properly configured and ready well before the examination day.
This pre-examination check should be completed on the computer that will be used to write the examination and in the testing area where the candidate will be taking the examination. This will provide an opportunity for the candidate to ask MonitorEDU any questions about the room configuration before examination day.
Candidates who have registered for an online examination must also meet these additional requirements in order to write the examination.
Step 3:  Examination Day
Candidates must be seated in the testing area at least 15 minutes prior to the time that the examination is scheduled to begin. Candidates must ensure that the testing environment is comfortable, quiet, and free of distractions and that the desk or table is cleared except for the Permitted Items, listed above.
The examination day check of equipment will be conducted via chat with MonitorEDU. The Proctor will then verify the candidate's identification, scan the examination area and screen the candidate to ensure that candidates are in compliance with the Rules and Protocol (for Lawyers or for Paralegals). Candidates may be asked to provide a 360-degree view or close-ups of the environment, clothing, glasses, ears or anything else that the Proctor deems necessary. The Proctor may ask to see the underside of the desk or table. During the screening process, candidates may be asked to adjust clothing or to relocate objects in the room.
Once the security screening is complete, candidates will be asked to access the examination webpage and to wait for the secure access code from the Proctor to begin part 1 of the examination. Candidates will have access to technical support from MonitorEDU before and during the examination through the chat feature in the unlikely event there is a technology issue. The Proctor will monitor candidates throughout the examination and will be able to communicate via audio.
The 4-hour examination will be written in 2 parts with each part being 2 hours in length. After candidates complete and submit the first part, they are provided a 30-minute break before beginning the second part. Candidates are not permitted to take any breaks other than the scheduled 30-minute break between the two parts. Candidates must write part 1 of the examination before part 2.
Once the candidate completes the examination, the candidate is required to shred, destroy, or rip into miniscule bits any paper note-taking material (including pieces of paper upon which no notes were made if so requested by the Proctor). Such shredding, destruction, or ripping shall be done both completely and to the satisfaction of the Proctor. Even if the Proctor does not request same, the candidate must complete the shredding, destruction, or ripping. All shredded, destroyed, and ripped note-taking material must also be immediately discarded in such a manner that it cannot be retrieved. Candidates are prohibited from attempting to re-construct, copy, retain, or otherwise make use of the note-taking material.
Step 4: Receive Your Examination Results
Examination results will be made available to candidates within approximately 6 to 8 weeks after the completion of the last test window for the licensing examination.  The Examination results release dates listed on our website are the latest dates that results will be released. We strive to exceed these dates whenever possible.
Note that results for the summer barrister and solicitor examinations written during test window 4 will be made available the week of October 26 and November 9, respectively. Candidates who are unsuccessful and must re-register for a later sitting of the examination must meet the posted registration deadline for the next sitting.
Candidates will receive results from the Law Society through their online account.

Writing an Online Examination
At what time should I arrive for my examination?
Candidates must be seated in the examination area 15 minutes prior to the time that the examination is scheduled to begin.
Does the pre-check time to test the equipment and Internet and scan the environment, etc. take away from the time I have to write the examination?
No. The examination clock does not begin until the candidate has entered the secure access code provided by the Proctor. An additional 15 minutes has been added to the time slots to allow for pre-examination check-in and post examination procedures.
How can I prepare for the online licensing examination?
Ensure that your personal email on file with the Law Society is correct
Ensure that your email is set up to allow emails from @monitoredu.com
Carefully read all communications and instructions about the new delivery platform, including emails received from the Law Society regarding your eligibility to write the examination as well as emails sent from the Law Society’s service provider, MonitorEDU
See the Guide to Licensing Examinations (for Lawyers or for Paralegals) for tips on preparing to write the examination, including strategies for reviewing the study materials
Ensure you have the required equipment specified in the Technical Requirements and conduct the pre-examination check of hardware and Internet bandwidth at least 5 days before the examination
Watch the video about live remote proctoring. The YouTube video is provided in English by a Law Society licensing examination service provider, MonitorEDU. Candidates may access French captioning by clicking on the settings wheel and selecting French (Canada) subtitles/CC
Install the proctoring software on the computer that will be used to write the examination
Access the Sample Online Examination to become familiar with how the software works
Review the Rules and Protocol (for Lawyers or for Paralegals)
Review the Candidate Agreement that you must agree to before you begin the examination
How do I know if I am eligible to write the online examinations?
If you wish to register for an online examination, you must first ensure you have paid the study material fee and examination fee before the registration deadline. If you have not been invoiced for these fees, contact the Law Society through your online account before the registration deadline for that sitting.
If you have paid the fees and submitted all other required documents before the deadline, you will be eligible to write the examination.  Once eligible, the Law Society will send you information about scheduling your examination with MonitorEDU.
What do I need to have with me on the day of my examination?
See list of permitted items above.
What happens at the start of my examination?
The examination day check of equipment will be conducted by MonitorEDU through the chat feature. The Proctor will then verify identification, scan the examination area and screen the candidate to ensure that candidates are in compliance with the Rules and Protocol (for Lawyers or for Paralegals). Once the security screening is complete, candidates will be asked to access the examination webpage and to wait for the secure access code from the Proctor to begin part 1 of the examination.
What if I want to defer writing the examination, what do I do?
If you want to defer your examination to later sitting, you must submit a Request for Change or Deferment Form (For Lawyers) (For Paralegals) to the Law Society through your online account by the required deferral deadline.
What will the online licensing examination be like?
It will be like taking the examination on paper, but the questions and answers will be viewed and submitted on the computer. The examination will continue to be multiple-choice and open book. Candidates will be checked in and their identification will be verified remotely. Live proctors will monitor candidates writing the examination.
Candidates must watch the video about remote proctoring and review the sample online examination to become familiar with the software. The YouTube video is provided in English by a Law Society licensing examination service provider, MonitorEDU. Candidates may access French captioning by clicking on the settings wheel and selecting French (Canada) subtitles/CC.
Why do I need to have a blank notepad or scrap piece to take notes during the examination? Why can’t I just make notes on my study materials?
This is a security measure to protect the integrity of the examination. Candidates are not permitted to write on or mark up in any manner their study materials or any other printed materials during the examination.
Once the candidate completes the examination, they are required to shred, destroy, or rip into miniscule bits any paper note-taking material. Such shredding, destruction, or ripping shall be done both completely and to the satisfaction of the Proctor. Even if the Proctor does not request same, the candidate must complete the shredding, destruction, or ripping. All shredded, destroyed, and ripped note-taking material must also be immediately discarded in such a manner that it cannot be retrieved. Candidates are prohibited from attempting to re-construct, copy, retain, or otherwise make use of the note-taking material.
There is also note-taking feature available on the software platform that candidates may use.
Candidates may keep their study materials after the examination, provided they did not make any notes on those materials during the examination.
Why do the walls immediately behind where I write my examination have to be clear?
A clear wall behind you is for security and proctoring purposes. The goal is to make sure that the wall area behind you is tidy and predictable and known to the proctor. You should plan on showing the area to the proctor so the proctor can assess if anything should be adjusted. If you have questions about your testing area, you may contact MonitorEDU using their live chat service, available 24/7 at https://monitoredu.com/live-chat
Will there be a break during the examination?
Yes. The 4-hour examination will be written in 2 parts with each part being 2 hours in length. After candidates complete and submit the first part, they are provided a 30-minute break before beginning the second part. Candidates are not permitted to take any breaks other than the scheduled 30-minute break between the two parts.
Examination Day Tips
What are some tips for the day of the examination?
As you prepare for the online licensing examination, we thought we’d share some tips with you to make your experience go as smoothly as possible!
When you finish
All of the answers you have submitted will be captured, regardless of whether your licensing examination ends automatically because the time has elapsed or you submit your examination before the time has elapsed. Rest assured that the Law Society performs a verification of your responses as part of its quality control procedures.
What you should do if you experience a significant issue
If you experience significant technical or health concerns while writing the licensing examination and express those concerns to your proctor, you may send a note immediately to the Law Society through your online account. The Law Society will follow up with you.
Troubleshooting
Sometimes you may find that one feature is not working the way you had anticipated. For example, you may find that you can’t navigate the questions the way you did on the sample online examination. This may be because you are experiencing a feature of the examination that you didn’t notice in the sample online examination.
For example, once you are in the “question review” mode, you may find that you only see some questions or you can’t see questions that appear in another tab. This is part of the feature. To avoid having an unexpected experience, spend lots of time testing out the sample online exam.
You may also find during the examination that you have accidentally hidden the question numbers that appear beneath the orange “question navigation” tab or that you can’t easily find a scroll bar. The best approach when you experience this type of issue is to remain calm and to find another method to get where you want to go (navigate from the top or beside the question or at the bottom). Remember—the system has several navigation methods!
Tools
Some of the tools that are intended to facilitate your experience take some getting used to. For example, when you use the highlighting or strikeout tool, the radio button to the left of that answer is selected. If you have not practised sufficiently with a tool in the sample online exam, you might find that it is better for you not to use it during the examination itself.
Technical glitches
Glitches can happen—your Internet could go down, a storm could cause the power to go out, your system could pause for a moment or two, etc. The most important thing is not to worry. Almost every glitch can be solved very quickly.
For example, in the case of a system pause, the system will often self-correct. Allow it to do so and avoid repeated clicks of the ‘Next’ button. The system will catch up with you. No time will have been lost.
Be sure to communicate with your proctor and let the proctor know what is happening. Your proctor will work with you to solve your concern. If you are worried about something, ask your proctor to note your concern. Bear in mind that your licensing examination answers are saved as you go and that the clock is tied to the system being operational.
Signing in and getting launched
Don’t worry if the examination doesn’t launch immediately—your proctor is there to help you navigate until your examination launches. Remember, the time you have to complete the licensing examination doesn’t start until the examination starts.
Getting help from your proctor
The proctor is monitoring you and other candidates at the same time—please give your proctor a few moments to get to you. If your proctor doesn’t respond right away to your verbal request for help, the proctor could be helping someone else. Please feel free to wave your hands in front of the camera so that the proctor has a visual cue that you are waiting for assistance.
Before you finish
Practise using the “Question Review” tool in the sample online examination to understand its functionality. If you have allocated time for review, this tool can help you identify questions that you missed before you submit your examination.
Length of the Examination
How long is the online licensing examination?
All licensing examinations in the 2020-21 licensing year are 4 hours in length, plus a 30-minute break between part 1 and part 2.
If the Law Society reduced the length of the examinations, will the examination fees also be reduced?
No. Law Society costs to develop a 4-hour examination remain the same as for the 7-hour examination. In addition, in order to move quickly to an online examination delivery model, the Law Society is incurring new costs.
Why and how did you reduce the length of the examinations?
The reduction in length was implemented to facilitate the transition to online delivery and was enabled through prioritizing competencies that are most relevant to effective and ethical practice and public protection.
The prioritization of competencies process and the length reduction process were supported by psychometricians to ensure continued defensibility. All licensing examinations continue to assess entry level competence for the lawyer and paralegal professions and continue to cover the most critical substantive law, procedural law, professional responsibility, and practice management concepts.
Will the 4-hour licensing examination be available next June?
The Law Society is making 4-hour examinations available to facilitate online delivery for the 2020-21 licensing process year because of COVID-19. The length and format of the examinations after this licensing process year will be considered in the future.
Scheduling the Examination
Can I still write an online examination if I am located outside of Ontario or Canada?
Yes, but all candidates must schedule their examination between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. EST/EDT.
I have a question about scheduling that is not answered here. How can I get more information?
If candidates have questions about scheduling the examination, MonitorEDU has a live chat service that is available 24/7 at https://monitoredu.com/live-chat.
For any questions about payments, eligibility and deferring writing the examination, candidates should contact the Law Society through their online account.
What options do I have to schedule my examination?
All 5-day test windows run from Tuesday to Saturday. No examinations will be scheduled on Canadian statutory holidays. Examination time slots are in the morning or afternoon. An additional 15 minutes has been added to the time slots to allow time for pre-examination check-ins and post-examination procedures. The allotted time to write the examination is 4 hours, plus a 30-minute break.  Candidates must schedule their examination to start and end between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. EST/EDT.
Examination Results
When will I get my results from the online licensing examination?
Examination results will be made available to candidates within 6 to 8 weeks after the completion of the last test window for the licensing examination. Note that results for barrister and solicitor examinations written during the summer Test Window 4 will be made available the weeks of October 26 and November 9, respectively. Candidates will receive results from the Law Society through their online account. Candidates who need to re-write an unsuccessful examination must register and make payment by the required deadline of the sitting they select.
Accommodations
I am a candidate who requires an accommodation to write the licensing examinations. What do I need to do?
Candidates may request accommodation based on a ground listed in the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19. Please see the Accommodations webpage (for Lawyers or for Paralegals) for more information.
What if I was approved for an accommodation for an upcoming licensing examination? Will I still have my accommodation with the online licensing examination?
Yes. The Law Society is committed to working with candidates to see that their accommodation needs are met under the circumstances. All candidates who were approved to receive accommodations for an in-person licensing examination will receive the same or equivalent accommodations for their online examination. The Law Society will communicate directly with candidates with approved accommodations who are scheduled to take an online examination as soon as possible.
Security and Privacy
How will the Law Society ensure the examination is secure?
The examination platform has several security features, including a secure lockdown browser, a Proctor who will monitor the candidate using two cameras and audio, the use of an access code to enter the examination and scans of the candidate and the testing area. Proctors can end the examination if there is a serious threat to security.
The video streams are not routinely recorded; however, if the Proctor perceives any attempts at cheating or other irregular testing behavior, segments of the candidate writing the examination may be recorded for the Law Society's review.
Will the service providers obtain any of my personal information?
For candidates to write the online examination, MonitorEDU will obtain the following information:
candidate name, cell phone number and email address
IP address
the name of the examination the candidate is writing
the testing organization (Law Society of Ontario)
individualized licensing examination information, if any (e.g., pursuant to an accommodation plan developed in connection with a ground listed in the Human Rights Code)
Please see MonitorEDU’s website for more information at https://monitoredu.com/your-privacy
Testing Area
Even though I hear some traffic noise or other neighbourhood sounds in my testing area, I still feel comfortable writing the examination in that space. Is it okay if there’s some noise while I write the examination?
Candidates need to ensure that they set the best conditions for themselves to write the examination. If you feel comfortable writing your examination in that space, then some background noise is allowed.
What if a child enters the testing area while I am writing the examination?
If a child wanders briefly into the room while you are writing the examination, you should arrange for the child to leave the testing area immediately and continue writing the examination.
What if a pet enters the testing area while I am writing the examination?
If a pet wanders into the room while you are writing the examination, you may continue writing.
What if I don’t have a private and/or quiet room in which to take the examination due to my personal living situation during the COVID-19 emergency?
The Law Society understands that some candidates may not have access to a quiet or private room in which to take an examination, particularly during the COVID-19 situation. However, candidates are still responsible for securing a testing area that meets the requirements for writing the online examination, and the Law Society expects that candidates will make all possible efforts and exhaust all options that are available to them to secure an appropriate testing area for their licensing examination. Seeking assistance from the Law Society should be a last resort.
If a candidate is unable to secure an appropriate testing area, the candidate may contact the Law Society to request assistance through the candidate’s online account at least 20 business days before the start of Test Window 1 of the candidate’s examination sitting. If the Law Society determines that the request is appropriate, the candidate will be sent a form to complete. This form is required to be completed and submitted within 2 business days of the date that the form was sent to the candidate.
While the Law Society does not guarantee that assistance can be obtained, the Law Society will make reasonable efforts to provide the candidate with at least one contact that may be willing to offer an appropriate testing area for the candidate to write the online examination. If one or more testing area contacts have been forwarded to the candidate, it is the candidate’s sole responsibility to coordinate use of the testing area with that contact. Please note that any testing area contacts may be provided to more than one candidate as there may be multiple candidates who have requested assistance in locating an appropriate testing area.
What if I need headphones, earplugs, or earbuds to write the examination?
Unless a specified accommodation has been granted based on a ground listed in the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, the wearing of headphones, earplugs, earbuds, or a device placed in the ear, is not permitted. These types of items or devices make it difficult for the proctor to adequately monitor the licensing examination to ensure a fair and equal testing environment. In addition to safeguarding the Law Society’s administration of the licensing examination, this rule protects a candidate’s examination results by limiting the potential for examination irregularities. Examination irregularity may result in the termination of the candidate’s examination or potentially the invalidation of all results for that examination.
What if someone enters the testing area while I am writing the examination?
If someone else enters the testing area, you must ask them to leave immediately. At the Proctor’s discretion, you may continue writing the examination once the person leaves the room.
Why am I required to show the Proctor the testing area?
To ensure the integrity of the examination, it is necessary for the Proctor to view the testing area. The Proctor needs to be sure candidates are taking the examination in the proper environment and without distractions.
Licensing Examination Delivery and Cost
Can I write the examination in person or at a different time than the test schedule provided?
As public health measures regarding social distancing remain in place indefinitely, all in-person delivery of the examinations has been cancelled until the end of March 2021.  The Law Society continues to actively monitor the public health situation and will communicate delivery plans for 2021-22 examinations early in 2021. You may defer writing your examination by submitting the Request for Change or Deferment Form (For Lawyers) (For Paralegals) through your online account.
Since the Law Society reduced the length of the examinations, will the examination fees be reduced?
Development costs for the 4-hour examination remain the same as for the 7-hour examination. The costs to administer the licensing examinations have not decreased.
What will the online licensing examination cost?
Licensing examination fees have not changed for online delivery. See the Law Society’s website for the Fee Schedule.
Will the online examination delivery format continue to be offered in the future after social distancing measures have been lifted?
The Law Society will consider this in due course. This webpage will be updated with new information.
