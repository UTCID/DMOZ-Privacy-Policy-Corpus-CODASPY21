Together We Can Help People be Resilient to Life's Challenges.
Thank you for helping LSS of South Dakota to provide an opportunity for growth and success to so many across our state.
Our mission began in 1920, and over the years the services we provide have changed and grown. But, the heart of LSS has not changed - we are still providing needed help to people - regardless of religion, race, or economic status. Last year we touched 45,781 lives.
Please give hope by helping others - a child who has been abused and neglected, a woman who needs grief counseling following the loss of her husband, a couple awaiting adoption, a child with special needs in need of a foster family, a family who is losing their home, a young couple trying to buy their first house, a single mom who can't afford afterschool and summer care for her children, a confused pregnant teen, a community recovering from flooding...and so many others who have experienced the pain of human life. Together, we see the potential for healing.
You may give securely online, or make your gift by check via the mail.
To learn more about how you can be a part of the LSS mission, please contact LSS Development & Foundation at 800-568-2401.
LSS of South Dakota is a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and all gifts to LSS are tax deductible to the full extent of the law. Our federal tax id is 46-0224731.
