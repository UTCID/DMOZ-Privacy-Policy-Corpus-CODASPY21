Thank you to everyone who donated so generously to our 2018 Backpack program!  Because of YOU we were able to provide every single one of the foster children we serve a new backpack stuffed with school supplies. Below are pictures from a few of our generous donors.
Rock star teachers and administrators from Brookwood and Settles Bridge Elementary Schools donated tons and tons of backpacks loaded with school supplies!
Thank you!
