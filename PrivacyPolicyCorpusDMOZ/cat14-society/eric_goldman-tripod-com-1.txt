Step 1: Determine why you are doing a policy and what
audience(s) you are trying to address
Step 2: Determine what statutory regulations you are
required to comply with:
If you
are marketing to kids (12 or under) or knowingly collecting info from
kids, COPPA applies and you should probably exit that business
If you
operate private messaging services, the ECPA applies
If you
are an Internet access provider with customers in Minnesota, the Minnesota
Internet privacy law (Ch. 325M) applies
If you
are a financial institution or are significantly engaged in financial
activities, Graham-Leach-Bliley applies
If you
are a healthcare provider or insurance company, HIPAA applies
If you
collect or use social security numbers, CA Civil Code 1798.85 may apply
If you
use or access credit reports, the FCRA may apply
If you
have European operations, the EU Directive applies and you should call
European counsel
Step 3: Determine if you are going to use one or more
third party validators such as TRUSTe, BBBOnline or PWC’s BetterWeb
Step 4: Do a site audit
Look
for existing data collection points, and consider future ones
Look
for existing privacy policy-like language
Step 5: Review your company’s existing business
practices and obligations
Look
for mandatory obligations to turn data over to third parties
Look
for other places where data is turned over anyway (such as to consultants
or vendors)
Determine
if you are complying with the EU Safe Harbor, or if you desire to do so
Look
at IAP and hosting agreements
Look
at ad network agreements
Look for
situations where you have voluntarily agreed to limit your use or
disclosure of information (such as traffic acquisition agreements or
agreements with European companies)
Step 6: Determine if
the policy will be a marketing representation or a contract
If it
is intended to be a contract, determine how the policy will be made into a
mandatory clickthrough with users or at data-collection points from
non-users
Step 7: Consider how the policy will be amended in
the future if the policy is a contract, or how data will be segregated between
user classes if the policy is a marketing representation
Step 8: Draft the policy and get internal and
external blessing
Step 9: Train employees about the policy
Step 10: Scrub the site to remove all privacy-related
language that isn’t in the policy
Step 11: Publicly post the policy
Step 12: If you want to P3P-enable your site,
implement your policy in a P3P-compliant XML file and upload to your website
Step 13: If you are doing an amendment, notify users
of the amended terms using the protocol described in the previous policy
Step 14: Keep archives of prior policies if you have
any data from users who are not legally upgraded to the new policy
Step 15: Establish a procedure for examining if new
site features require changes to the policy
Step 16: Put into place a contingency plan in case
things go wrong
