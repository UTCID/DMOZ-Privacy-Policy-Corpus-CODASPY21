Movement for Violence PreventionTubman’s Movement for Violence Prevention (MVP) series helps youth organize around violence prevention. This class will help teens expand their knowledge about violence prevention strategies and will also give them the tools to provide presentations to other youth so that they can create safer communities.
Participants receive a pre-loaded PowerPoint presentation and a certificate recognizing graduates of Tubman’s MVP Youth Leadership Group after they have completed the course. Participation in this course also serves as a great resume builder that showcases a commitment to making a difference.
MVP helps youth organize social justice projects about violence prevention. There is no cost to join, but participants must attend both sessions to complete MVP. Registration is not necessary, but it is helpful for planning purposes. To register, click on the dates you wish to attend below, call 612.870.2426 or email teens@tubman.org. For more information on MVP please call 612.825.3333.
