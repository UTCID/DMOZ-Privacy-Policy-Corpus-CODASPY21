DAVID C COOK COOKIE POLICY
Updated October 2020
Welcome and Introduction
Welcome to David C Cook (including our divisions and affiliates, “we” or “us” or “our”). We operate a number of different websites. These include davidccook.org and integritymusic.com. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and safeguard personal information. This Privacy Policy also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your personal information, and how you can reach us to get answers to your questions.
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that we transfer to your machine’s (including any computer, mobile phone or tablet) hard drive through your web browser and we read on subsequent visits. They enable our systems to recognize you through your browser, when you log on, and to provide you certain personalized features, including the storage of items in your shopping cart in between visits.
Like most other companies that engage in online commerce, we use cookies and other technologies to identify which parts of our website are the most popular, how easily our website is navigated, and how much time our customers spend in each section. This is standard practice with many similar companies, and it helps us structure our website to meet your unique needs and make our website more friendly. Among other uses, cookies also help us customise your experience with us, by enabling us to remember what products you may have looked at previously, identify who you are so that we can customise a greeting for you, and so we can personalise our other, sometimes unrelated, interactions with you.
You may, of course, choose to disable the cookies, but, if you do, certain functions or areas of our website will become unavailable to you as a result.
Below is information about cookies, tags and other similar devices used by this website, with information regarding the purpose and duration of each of them.
