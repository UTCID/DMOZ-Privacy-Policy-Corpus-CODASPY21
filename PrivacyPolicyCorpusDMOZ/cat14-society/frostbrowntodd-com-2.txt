Hemp Legally Speaking
The Hemp Legally Speaking Blog focuses on all the interrelated areas of the hemp-derived CBD business, from cultivation and production to warehousing, transportation, marketing and retail. It provides timely updates on both national and state-specific hemp regulations and enforcement trends, with articles written by attorneys regarded as leading advocates for the hemp industry — including Jonathan Miller, who has played an outsized role in crafting and securing passage of state and federal legislation that ensured hemp’s legalization, particularly the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill.
While compliance remains the principle focus of the blog, our contributors also provide insights on entity formation, product liability, and trademark and patent protections for hemp-related IP, as well as other issues unique to the industrial hemp and CBD marketplaces. You can subscribe below to get the latest in hemp law news and analysis sent directly to your inbox.
