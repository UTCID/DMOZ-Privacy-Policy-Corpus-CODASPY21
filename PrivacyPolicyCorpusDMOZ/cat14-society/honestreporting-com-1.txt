This privacy policy is intended to be applied in conjunction with related Honest Reporting policies, including, but not limited to, our Donor Bill of Rights. This policy may be revised and updated periodically by electronic notice posted on our website. Your continued use of our website after the date that such notices are posted will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.
We hold strictly private all supporter records, at least for such time as required by law, unless the supporter grants permission to use selective information for purposes of referrals and/ or publicity.
Information maintained includes donor name amount donated/ pledged, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, , family member’s names, and related notes.

We will not sell, trade, or share supporter information collected on the website or through any other business activities with anyone else, unless the supporter specifically, in writing, provides permission to do so, or the Organization is ordered to do so by Court.
We have procedures in place to limit access to information to only those company-approved personnel who need to know such information in order to fulfill our mission.

The Donor Bill of Rights(Developed by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel (AAFRC), Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and National Society of Fund Raising Executives (NSFRE)).
Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
I. To be informed of the organization’s mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization’s governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
III. To have access to the organization’s most recent financial statements.
IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.
VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.
X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.
Contact us: If you have any questions about this Donor Privacy Policy or if you wish to be removed from our e-mail or mailing lists, please email donations@honestreporting.com or call us at 1 (847)-745-8184.
