If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Starlight infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted to the Site on one of the public profiles, product reviews, or Starlight stories), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Starlight to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Starlight a counternotice.Notices and counternotices must meet the current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see the information provided by the Library of Congress United States Copyright Office at http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counternotices with respect to the Site should be sent to: Starlight Children’s Foundation, Attention: Legal Department, 400 Corporate Pointe, Suite 590, Culver City, CA 90230 (310) 479.1212.We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counternotice.
