Introduction
Canada’s national privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act came into force on January 1, 2001. Since January 1, 2004, this privacy legislation applies to all businesses that collect, use or disclose Personal Information. Personal Information means information about you that can be used to identify you. Depending on the country or province you live in, you may have rights under similar laws.
We know that doing business online involves a great deal of trust on your part; we take this trust very seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information you provide us. We pledge to protect your privacy and safeguard your personal information.
How we gather information from users
PageMaster Publication Services is the sole owner of the information collected on PageMasterPublishing.ca. PageMasterPublishing.ca collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

To use all features of this Web site (such as convenient orders and repeat downloads) you may choose to register. On registration you complete the registration form and create a user name and password.  During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
We’ll send you a confirmation email when your email address is signed up to ensure someone hasn’t done it on your behalf. Once you confirm your address, a welcome email will sent.
You will automatically be subscribed to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.  Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section. Unsubscribing from the newsletter does not close your account at PageMasterPublishing.ca. You can still use our services without receiving our newsletter.
Orders
When you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
Your financial information is safe. We have partnered with Authorize.Net, a leading payment gateway since 1996, to accept credit cards and electronic check payments safely and securely for our customers.

Industry leading encryption hardware and software methods and security protocols to protect customer information.

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes and may use it to send participants an email newsletter.
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
