CASA of West Texas is a non-profit organization and we cannot achieve our mission without donations and finanical support from people just like you. Gifts, both large and small, help us achieve our mission to recruit, train and support committed volunteers who advocate for child abuse victims. Every foster child needs a CASA and you can give them the voice they need. 500 children in our area will need a CASA volunteer this year to help them navigate the foster care system. Please give today to help us serve 100% of the foster children right here in our communities. Thank you!
Thank you in advance for your generous support that allows us to make a difference in the lives of abused and neglected children in the foster care system.
