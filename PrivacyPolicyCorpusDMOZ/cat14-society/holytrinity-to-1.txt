Spirited Conversations continues this month with a sermon by Martin Luther King suggested by Len Desroches.
The group is friendly and open to new people. The membership is not fixed and changes with the seasons and the material. We meet online about once a month. At each gathering we will focus our discussion around a selected article, podcast or book.
The reading will be emailed to you when you register.
Participants share in the selection of future readings and topics.
Dianne Mesh is an experienced and sensitive facilitator of group discussions of spirituality and faith. She is currently the interim priest on staff at Holy Trinity.Keith Nunn is interested in people and community. He is biblically and theologically literate, but is no longer a  theist. He has been a member of Holy Trinity for more than 25 years.
Some people believe much that the church has traditionally taught. Some believe little but have found ways to stay. Some have left or have thought about it. Some, believing little or none of the dogma of the church are struggling to stay. People holding all these positions are welcome to join the conversation.

music, poetry and cocktails with your host, Keith Nunn
Cocktail hour is a state of mind. It is a little bit of ritual that helps unwind from a difficult day or can make us more ready to be with others. Booze is optional, but the time that is taken to make oneself a beautiful drink should be celebrated and cherished.
My vision in creating Lifting Spirits is to capture some of the good parts of church (and bar) culture and to bring it into a welcoming and non-dogmatic space where we celebrate art and beauty, take care of each other, listen, celebrate, mourn, and hold. Currently connected to Holy Trinity TO, this is not a religion, it is a way of being with each other with few rules: be kind, listen, seek joy.
Lifting Spirits on YouTube
We start with a little cocktail building session at 7:15pm for about 15 minutes. I’ll post the materials list a few days beforehand in my email broadcast. There is also a Lifting Spirits Channel on YouTube where cocktail information and some performances are collected for your later enjoyment.
Once we have equipped ourselves with a libation, we’ll wander up to my studio for a little open mic, poetry reading and conversation. If you’d like to play something or recite something, that would be fantastic. We can improvise, but it doesn’t hurt if I have some idea how many want to share something beforehand. In between performances we’ll chat. If the numbers grow enough that it’s hard to chat, then we’ll start to use the breakout rooms.
