There are no sectors that are not affected by privacy legislation and many that are impacted more than others. How organisations and agencies deal with personal information influences how they interact with their customers and other businesses.
In the meantime privacy legislation continues to grow and develop and become more complex. Keeping up with the changes is challenging. Through our broad range of private and public sector clients we have an excellent understanding of privacy legislation across different industries.
Our approach to privacy law and access information involves:
providing practical advice in a timely fashion;
avoiding an overly technical approach; and
alternative dispute resolution.
