Meals for Kids
The Food Bank of Northern Nevada wants all children to have the food they need to be able to focus on their schoolwork, grow and thrive.
Home > Get Help > Meals for Kids
The Kids Cafe program provides free, nutritious meals to kids while they are out of school.  Throughout the school year, the Kids Cafe Dinner Program serves after school meals at several schools and community centers throughout the Reno/Sparks area.
Meals are available at no charge for all children and youth ages 1-18.
Children do not have to attend any after school programming being offered at the time of meal service in order to be served dinner.
The Food Bank has been granted a temporary waiver, due to COVID-19) to allow meals to be taken off site to be eaten after school.
