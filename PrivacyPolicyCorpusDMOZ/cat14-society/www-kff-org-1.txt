Here’s our recap of the past week in the coronavirus pandemic from our tracking, policy analysis, polling, and journalism.
The United States surpassed the grim milestone of 200,000 confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 this week and is on the verge of 7 million total cases. However, a KHN article reporting on California’s death totals in the first five months of the pandemic suggests that about 5,000 “excess” deaths not attributed to COVID-19 – an unusually high number — could be partially due to an undercount of officially reported COVID-19 related deaths.
With the school year underway and localities taking varying approaches to school attendance, a new KFF brief examines not only the published studies on COVID-19 risks for children, but also broader health and economic impacts the pandemic has had on them and their families.
As the country awaits a vaccine and Americans worry about political pressure leading to premature approval of one, a KHN article examines the safety monitoring board that will be making these critical decisions.
Here are the latest coronavirus stats from KFF’s tracking resources:
Global Cases and Deaths: Total cases worldwide surpassed 32 million this week – with an increase of approximately 2 million new confirmed cases in the past seven days. There were approximately 35,700 new confirmed deaths worldwide, bringing the total to nearly 981,800 confirmed deaths.
U.S. Cases and Deaths: Total confirmed cases in the U.S. neared 7 million this week. There was an approximate increase of 303,200 confirmed cases between September 18 and September 24. Approximately 5,200 confirmed deaths in the past week brought the total in the United States to approximately 202,800.
