Terms of Use Agreement
Welcome to innocenceproject.org, the website and online service of the Innocence Project (“Innocence Project,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Innocence Project Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. Innocence Project reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).
1. Use of Our Service
Innocence Project is a national litigation and public policy organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice. The Service allows you to engage with us and other individuals interested in furthering the Innocence Project’s mission.
A. Eligibility
This is a contract between you and Innocence Project. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Innocence Project Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Innocence Project, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Innocence Project.
B. Innocence Project Service
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Innocence Project reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Innocence Project Content (as defined below). Innocence Project may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.
You may make donations to Innocence Project through the Service by following the instructions on the website. Once a donation is made, the transaction is final and nonrefundable, and cannot be disputed or reversed unless it was made fraudulently. If you become aware of any fraudulent use of your payment method, you should report this to the applicable operator in accordance with their reporting rules. When you make a donation, we may need to verify your identity or the details you have given us; you agree that you will provide such information or documents as we reasonably request from time to time to enable us to do so.
C. Innocence Project Accounts
Your Innocence Project account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Innocence Project with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Innocence Project immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Innocence Project will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by clicking the appropriate link embedded in the emails you receive.  By providing Innocence Project your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by clicking the unsubscribe link embedded in the email. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

Accessing any audiovisual content that may be available on the Service for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the functionality of the Service. “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Innocence Project Service to a User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.
We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Innocence Project Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Innocence Project shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.
