By clicking on a link below, you are leaving Cyber Criminals Most Wanted. Have Fun! All content and website policies are the responsibility of the website you are visiting.
For Help with Online Situations:
You tell someone to stop what they are doing many times and they will not stop. What they are doing is making you uncomfortable or embarrassed because you know that mom, dad or the adult in your life will not approve of what this person is saying or showing you in an email, through instant messenger or in a chatroom. CLICK HERE when you want to report this.
Your online friend is in trouble and needs your help NOW. They want to meet you at a place you both know in a few minutes. Tell them ‘you will help’ and immediately disconnect. Tell mom, dad or an adult as soon as you disconnect. Then call 911 and tell the police everything. Let the adults and police help your friend. If your online friend is in as much trouble as you believe, you will need an adult around to assist your friend anyway. You are protecting yourself and your family just in case your online friend is not really your friend at all but turns out to be a naughty person. And, you are not lying because you are giving them someone who really can help them.
