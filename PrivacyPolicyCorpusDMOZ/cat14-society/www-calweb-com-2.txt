Your Personal Information
From time to time, we will ask for information that personally identifies you, as in our user surveys or registration for CalWeb Internet Services services such as e-mail, forums, or promotions.

In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information but only in a form that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.
Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances, but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the information the purpose for which it will be disclosed.
