Thanks to our supporters, participants, and sponsors, the 2020 Birdathon was a resounding success and raised over $45,000 this year!
Birdathon is a unique tradition that takes place at Audubon chapters across the country during spring migration, and in Houston, the event has taken place every year since 1981.  Thanks to the enthusiasm from each of you, we were able to keep this tradition alive even with unique challenges due to the COVID-19 crisis.
The Masked Canaries
This year, with modified rules to follow social distancing guidelines, Birdathon teams found new ways to participate, and we are especially grateful for the efforts from everyone involved who helped support our mission to advance the conservation of birds and positively impact their supporting environments. As a result, funds raised helped Houston Audubon recover significant revenue losses due to sanctuary closures and canceled programs and events during the COVID-19 pandemic.
