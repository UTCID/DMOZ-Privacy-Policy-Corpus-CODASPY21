Cybercrime is a constant threat and incidents are in the news every day. While everyone can be a target, some high-profile individuals face far greater risks of attack, both in volume and sophistication. In this joint webinar, our Cybersecurity practice will examine some of the cybersecurity attacks that target high-profile and high net worth individuals, as well as their associates, businesses and families. We will give examples of attacks and provide some practical tips for mitigating risks.
The Thompson Coburn Cybersecurity team will be joined by Dr. Chris Pierson, Founder and CEO of BlackCloak, a company specializing in addressing threats to high-profile targets. Please join us for a very engaging, and sometime disconcerting, review of this important topic.
CLE
This webinar is approved for 1.2 hours general CLE credit in Missouri and 1.0 hour general CLE credit in California and Illinois. 1.0 hour general CLE credit in Texas is pending.
