AIM’s Privacy Policy
Out of respect for the privacy of our supporters, Accuracy in Media (AIM) provides its donors the option to remain anonymous and also we respect their choice to not have their personal information shared with others.
AIM will not trade, rent, or sell any donor information to any organization that uses such information for commercial purposes or gain.  From time to time, AIM makes its donor mailing lists (name and address listing) available for one-time exchange or rental use by other selected conservative non-profit organizations to help us grow our financial resources for the long-term.
Supporters have the option to exclude their information from any lists that we exchange or rent.  Please contact us so we can honor your request to opt-out of such exchanges and rentals, or if you wish your gift listing to remain anonymous.
