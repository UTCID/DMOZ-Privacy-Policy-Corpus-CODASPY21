How do we collect personal data?
We collect personal data about you and use it in ways that we hope are consistent with the expectations of our members. This broadly fits into two categories:
We collect personal data about you from the information you or your firm/chambers/organisation give us when you or they contact us to become a member of the association and through the course of your membership to administer your membership.
We collect information about your membership-related activities through the course of your membership with us.
We will never sell your personal data or use it to market commercial products and services (although ELA publications may occasionally carry advertisements which are incidental in nature).
What personal data do we collect and how do we use it?

We collect personal contact details, such as name, address, telephone number and email address, type and date of legal qualification, confirmation of material engagement in the provision of employment law services to clients. The contact details we hold for you are usually those of your professional place of work, unless you ask us to hold your personal contact details on your membership record.  You can see the information we hold in your membership record by logging into MY ELA.
Your personal details are used to make decisions about your membership, including eligibility for membership and this is necessary to carry out the contractual obligations set out in ELA’s Memorandum and Articles of Association.  Provision of this information is a contractual requirement and without such information is it is not possible for us to consider your application for membership.
Accounting Information
We collect start and end date of membership, bank account details where you supply services to us or request a refund from us, payment records, login details for website access, for our legitimate interest in collecting your membership fees to further ELA’s objects.

You can change your mailing preferences by logging into MY ELA.
ELA Online Directories
ELA provides a directory of its members.  Inclusion in the Membership Directory is optional and you can also choose whether your profile is viewable only by other members or is accessible to the public.
ELA also maintains a Register of Mediators for members who are suitably qualified.  Inclusion in the Register of Mediators is also optional and you can choose whether your entry is viewable only by other members or is accessible to the public.
When you choose to have an entry in the ELA online Membership Directory and/or Register of Mediators you may choose to upload your photograph and provide details about the professional services you offer.   The personal data that you provide in connection with the Membership Directory and/or Register of Mediators is processed for the legitimate purpose of promoting the professional services of our members and in order to further the aims of the Association.
You can update your entries in both these directories and change your privacy preferences at any time by logging into MY ELA.

When you book an event, you are given an opportunity to tell us if you do not want your name to be included on the event delegate list.
Our delegate list is also made available to members who are booked to attend the event who have downloaded the ELA Event App.

We also collect your dietary and other special needs requirements which you tell us about and which we share with the venues where we hold our events.    Where you provide this information you consent to our using it for the limited purpose for which it is provided.  You can review, change or delete your requirements by logging into MY ELA.

After the webinar has been broadcast, all members' data is deleted from the webinar platform, and is only retained by ELA in accordance with our data retention policy for delegate lists of past events.
When you participate in or volunteer for ELA services or projects
We collect additional data about you if you volunteer or participate in ELA services and projects. The specific data and purposes for which it is collected is detailed below.
Speaking at ELA eventsWe collect evaluation data from delegates about ELA events you speak at which is shared with other ELA members who serve on the relevant ELA organising committee to support and further the aims of ELA’s training programme. We also collect the materials (slides, hand outs etc) you provide to us for the events, which we make available to other ELA members which is necessary for the legitimate purpose of furthering ELA’s aims.

Providing articles to our membership magazine ELA BriefingWe collect your photograph and your opinions about employment law related matters when you agree to write an article for us, which we share with other members, including those located outside the EEA, which is necessary for the legitimate purpose of furthering ELA’s aims.

Participating in ELA's legislative and policy workWe collect your name when you agree to participate in ELA’s policy work and as otherwise necessary when coordinating joint responses to legislative proposals. Your personal data is shared, in the form of the list of working party members, with government and other bodies and is viewable publically on the ELA website when we publish our consultation and other responses, which is necessary for the legitimate purpose of furthering ELA’s aims.
Elections to the ELA Management CommitteeWe engage Civica Electoral Services (CES) to carry out elections to the management committee, which are carried out anonymously.  Aggregated voting data will be collected and shared with us but voting is otherwise anonymous. We will share the information members standing in the elections give to us in their Nomination Form with CES for the purposes of conducting the ballot.This is necessary for the purposes of performing the contractual obligations set out in ELA’s Memorandum and Articles of Association.
Running ELAWe occasionally use information set out above to help decide how best to manage ELA and the membership services that we provide.  We may also use information to help resolve technical problems using the website.   We process this information where necessary for the legitimate purpose of furthering ELA’s aims.
Due to the nature of ELA, there may be occasions where we process your personal data in other ways in order to further ELA’s aims, for example in order to introduce new initiatives or to consult with the membership about issues of the day.
How do we share your personal data?
We share your data in the ways specified above.
In addition, as you would expect, we also use third party suppliers to provide services to us, such as IT, email and website systems providers and contractors, election management, accounting and audit, survey, payment and publishing service providers in order to provide membership services to you.  Where we share your personal data with third parties we ensure that we have appropriate measures in place to safeguard it and to ensure that it is solely used for legitimate purposes in line with this privacy policy.
As a membership organisation much of our work is undertaken by volunteers who make use of their firm/chambers/organisation’s email systems to communicate and in the event that you contact other members about ELA projects then please understand that ELA has no control over these third party systems.
When do we transfer your personal data overseas?
Due to the international nature of our membership base we will occasionally transfer personal data outside the EEA as described above.
In common with many other organisations, we make use of cloud-based solutions, including but not limited to Dropbox, SendGrid, Rackspace, SagePay, Xero, some of whose servers may be based outside the EEA, but are compliant with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework.
