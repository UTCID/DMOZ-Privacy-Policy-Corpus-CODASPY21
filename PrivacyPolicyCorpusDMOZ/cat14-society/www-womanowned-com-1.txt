Apply regardless

this Agreement.
If WomanOwned deems it necessary, in its sole discretion, WomanOwned
may immediately terminate this Agreement, your account and your access to the

will make note of the date of the last update to the Agreement on the first
page of this Agreement. You are responsible for reviewing these terms and
conditions regularly. Your continued use of the Service after such
modifications will be deemed to be your conclusive acceptance of all
modifications to this Agreement. If you are dissatisfied as a result of such
modification(s), your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the
Service.
Entire Agreement
This Agreement governs your use of the Service and
constitutes the entire agreement between you and WomanOwned. It supersedes any

and third parties, including but not limited to, Service Providers and others.
You represent and warrant that those third party agreements do not interfere
with your obligations and duties to WomanOwned under this Agreement.

This Agreement and the relationship between you and WomanOwned
will be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, notwithstanding the choice
of law provisions of the venue where any action is brought, where the violation
occurred, where you may be located or any other jurisdiction. You agree and
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in
Columbus, Ohio and waive any defense of lack of personal jurisdiction or
improper venue or forum non conveniens to a claim brought in such court, except
that WomanOwned may elect, in its sole discretion, to litigate the action in
the county or state where any breach by You occurred or where you can be found.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
cause of action arising out or related to your use of the Service or this
Agreement shall be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
action arose or will forever be barred.
