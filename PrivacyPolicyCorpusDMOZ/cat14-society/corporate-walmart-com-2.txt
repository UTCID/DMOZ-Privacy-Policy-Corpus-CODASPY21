Tips to Help Avoid Gift Card Fraud
Walmart Gift Cards can only be used at Walmart stores or Sam’s Clubs in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or on-line at Vudu, Inc., Walmart.com or Samsclub.com. No legitimate government entity, including the IRS, Treasury Department, FBI or local police department, will accept any form of gift cards as payment.Other businesses do not accept payments in the form of Walmart Gift Cards. For example, you will never be asked to pay your utility bills, bail money, debt collection and hospital bills with Walmart Gift Cards.Do not purchase, sell, or check your balance on online marketplaces outside of Walmart.com.If you get a call from a stranger who says that a loved one is in trouble and they ask you to provide gift card numbers to help them, hang up and contact your loved one directly.Don’t always trust your caller ID. Scammers can manipulate a caller ID to look like a legitimate company or government agency.Don’t purchase a gift card if it appears that the packaging has been altered or manipulated. If you have questions about a gift card, ask someone who works at that store.Don’t click on or respond to online ads or websites offering free gift cards. These are often scams.If you think you’ve been the victim of a gift card scam, report it to the Federal Trade Commission at ftccomplaintassistant.gov.Common Gift Card Scams
The Grandparent ScamIn this scam, the scammer will call a victim and indicate that a loved one is in some sort of trouble (i.e. kidnapped, arrested, etc.). Sometimes, the scammer pretends to be a lawyer or the loved one themselves and asks directly for money. The scammer then instructs the victim to purchase gift cards and give the gift card numbers to the scammer over the phone.The Tech Support ScamPerpetrators of tech support scams try to trick victims into believing their computers are infected and they need help. Some scammers pretend to be connected with Microsoft, Apple or a familiar security software company such as Norton or McAfee, and claim to have detected malware that poses an imminent threat to the person’s computer. Other scams feature planted website ads or pop-ups that display warning messages, some even featuring a clock ticking down the minutes before the victim’s hard drive will be destroyed by a virus — unless he or she calls a toll-free number for assistance in deactivating the menace. Such scammers will often ask for remote access to your computer to run phony diagnostic tests and pretend to discover defects in need of fixing. They’ll pressure you to pay for unnecessary repairs or new software, and ask for payment via gift cards.Additional Resources

Government Impostor Scam
Scammers sometimes pretend to be government officials to get you to send them money. They might promise lottery winnings if you pay “taxes” or other fees, or they might threaten you with arrest or a lawsuit if you don’t pay a supposed debt. Regardless of their tactics, their goal is the same: to get you to send them money.IRS Scam
During tax season, scammers pretend to be from the IRS or other Government Agencies to scare customers into sending them money. They trick people into believing they owe taxes to the IRS. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation, or loss of a business or driver’s license. They ask the victims to go to Walmart to send a money transfer or to put the money on a prepaid card or gift card.In reality, the IRS usually first contacts people by mail – not by phone – about unpaid taxes. The IRS or any other government agency, such as prisons or jails, won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card, gift cards, or money transfers. The agency also won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone.Common Tactics Used by Callers Committing Fraud
They use common names and fake IRS badge numbersThey know the last four digits of the victim’s Social Security NumberThey make caller ID appear as if the IRS is callingThey send bogus IRS emails to support their scamThey call a second time claiming to be the police or DMV, and caller ID again supports their claimWhat You Need to Know

Scams: Phishing, Vishing and Smishing and how to avoid them
Scams
Coronavirus Scam:
Beware Scammers may be targeting customers asking them to send money in order to reserve a Coronavirus vaccine or government stimulus check. If you’re asked to wire money, provide a money order or load a prepaid/gift card to pay to reserve a Coronavirus vaccine or to obtain a government stimulus check, it is not legitimate.Visit IRS Coronavirus Related ScamsPhishing:
A fraud method in which the fraudster sends out a legitimate-looking email in an attempt to gather personal and financial information from recipients. The scammer sends an email to an unsuspecting customer that may look just like a legitimate Walmart email (including use of the Walmart logo.) If the customer falls for the bait (thus the “fishing” reference), the thief could get credit card numbers, PINs, account passwords, expiration dates, credit card/bank account numbers and even Social Security numbers. Learn more about phishing. Learn more about phishing.Vishing:
Vishing is very similar to "phishing" but instead of occurring through email, vishing happens over the phone. In these scams, fraudsters pose as a trusted retailer or bank and obtain personal information from the customer by requesting they "verify" the information on file. The information gained is then used for fraudulent transactions.A good rule of thumb: If someone is contacting you to verify your personal information, it is very likely you did not provide it to them in the first place, and it is not a legitimate request. Legitimate companies will not expect you to provide your social security number or other personal information when they call you. If you receive a call like this, do not provide any information. If in doubt, call back a trusted number for the company, such as the one on a statement or invoice, the back of your credit/debit card, or on their official website (Do not use the phone number provided by the person on the phone or sent through a suspicious email.) Learn more about vishing. Smishing:
A combination of the terms "SMS" and "phishing." It is similar to phishing, but refers to fraudulent messages sent over SMS (text messaging) rather than email. The fraudster may text you saying you’ve won a free gift card. Remember, you can’t win a contest you didn’t enter. Walmart doesn’t notify winners of any contest via text message. Learn more about smishing.Tips to Avoid These Scams
Never provide personal information in response to an unsolicited request, whether it is over the phone or internet. A trusted company will never ask a customer for highly sensitive information during a call they initiated. A financial institution may ask for the account holder’s partial Social Security Number for verification, but they will never ask for the entire Social Security Number, account number or PIN. Do not respond to any suspicious looking email, automated calls, or text messages. Don’t trust the Caller ID. Fraudsters can manipulate the Caller ID to have it display a legitimate business’ name. To be safe, you can check to see if the phone number matches the number that appears on your bank statement, credit/debit card, or on their official website. Avoid fraudulent sites by entering web addresses directly into the browser yourself or by using bookmarks you create. Do not click on links in emails that you did not directly request from a company or that look suspicious. If you have fallen victim to such a scam, contact your financial institution immediately to protect your accounts.Don't respond or reply to an email, phone call, or text message that:Requires you to supply personal or account information directly in the emailRequires you to click on a link to provide more personal or account informationThreatens to close or suspend your account if you do not take immediate actionInvites you to answer a survey that asks you to enter personal or account informationStates that your account has been compromised or that there has been third-party activity on your account, then asks you to enter or confirm your personal or account information
Online Orders (Shopping Scam)
Online Orders
With an international company such as Walmart, brand abuse is inevitable. If you received an order confirmation email from Walmart but you did not place an order, it may be a phishing scam attempting to gather information, or in some cases, spread malware. Signs of Fraud
The recipient may have not placed a Walmart.com orderThe message contains very poor grammar.There is no order number or details about the order. A real order confirmation email contains the details of your order without clicking on any links, as well as where it is being shipped and the payment method.The email listed as the sender is not from an @walmart.com domain. You can see the embedded email address by hovering your cursor over the “from” line in the email.There may be multiple emails listed in the “to” line, or there may be “undisclosed recipients"How to Protect Yourself
If you actually placed an order and are suspicious about the email you received, log onto your Walmart.com account to check your order status. Remember not to click on any links within the email claiming to take you to your account. Keep your virus software updated on all your computers.If you were a victim of fraud, you should file a report with your local law enforcement agency along with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/.

Person In Need (Grandparent Scam)
Person In Need
Scammers may pose as relatives or friends, calling or sending messages to urge you to wire money or load prepaid cards immediately. They’ll say they need cash to help with an emergency---like getting out of jail, paying a hospital bill, or needing to leave a foreign country. The goal is to trick you into sending money before you realize it is a scam.Common Tactics Used by Callers Committing Fraud
They call or text from numbers that look familiarThey play on your emotionsThey swear you to secrecyThey need the money immediatelyWhat You Need to Know
1. Caller ID can be faked2. Always talk to someone to verify what was told to you3.

Providing gift card numbers over the phone should not be a method of providing funds. Once the numbers are provided, the funds are gone. ALWAYS validate that the loved one is in trouble.Additional ResourcesScam Awareness
Mystery Shopper Scam
Mystery Shopper
Mystery shopping, sometimes referred to as secret shopping, is where an individual is hired to “act” like a customer, and evaluate services at a business. Walmart does NOT utilize these services or hire associates to perform services on behalf of other retailers or companies. However, scammers take advantage of these types of programs by sending fraudulent solicitations via mail, text, or email to entice consumers to evaluate the retail experience. Often times these offers of employment are accompanied by a fake check made out for a large amount of money or otherwise offer immediate employment with a good salary and minimal effort required. Signs of Fraud
These communications are often associated with fictional departments or branding initiatives with letters or emails coming from addresses that appear to be “Wal-Mart” or an address such as “admin@walmart.com”.There is usually another email address embedded in the “from” line. You can see the embedded email address by hovering your cursor over the “from” line in the email.There may be multiple emails listed in the “to” line, or to “undisclosed recipients”A website may be lacking Walmart branding, the Walmart Privacy Policy, and the general look and feel of other Walmart websites. Other signs may include using outdated Walmart logos and branding. (e.g Walmart typed as “Wal-Mart” or “Wal«Mart”)Associates hired by Walmart are required to complete a hiring process, including legally required paperwork and drug testing.Walmart will NEVER mail you a check and ask that you deposit it in order to purchase an item or service and keep the remainder of the amount as payment for services.These communications ask consumers to assist with Walmart's secret shopping efforts through evaluation of MoneyGram services we provide and often lead to consumer financial loss or identity theft.
How these scams workThe scam artist sends a letter or email solicitation describing a paid, stay-at-home position in which the consumer will evaluate customer services at large retail stores. In reality, these stores have no affiliation with the scam artist placing the ad.After responding to the ad, the consumer receives an "employment packet" containing a training assignment, a list of products to purchase at different stores and a realistic-looking cashier's check, often for several thousand dollars.The "training assignment" is to deposit the check into the consumer's bank account, pose as a shopper and then use Money Gram to send the balance of the check's proceeds (minus the cost of the purchases and the consumer's "salary") to an address outside the United States.The problem is that the check is fake; so when it bounces (is returned to your account by your bank as “insufficient funds” or a “drawn on a closed account”) —which occurs after the money is wired—the consumer is accountable (in some cases, criminally) to the bank for the entire amount of the fake check, plus additional penalty fees. Also, in some instances, consumers are asked for personal bank account information. The company will then "deposit" money into their account for payment and funds with which to perform their Secret Shopper tasks. These consumers often then become victims of identity theft or have their accounts drained by the fraudster.How to Protect Yourself
Don't open or respond to unsolicited emails asking you to become a mystery shopper or secret shopper.Never deposit a check you receive in the mail from a "mystery shopping" company. No legitimate business will pay in advance and ask you to send back a portion of the money.If you have posted your resume to an online job site, verify with the site any job solicitations you receive.Don't click on or respond to online ads or web sites offering free gift cards.Remember, if it sounds too good to believe, it is!Walmart Practices
Walmart never solicits mystery shoppers via e-mail, mail, or any other public meansThese shopper offers are not from Walmart and should be deleted or reported, per the next section:To Report Suspected Wire Transfer Scams

Free Gifts Scam
Free Gifts
The goal of this scam is to encourage consumers to take multiple surveys and pay for shipping in exchange for a “free” gift, like a high quality piece of jewelry, a store branded gift card for a significant amount, or another product. However, after fulfilling the requirements, the consumer may never receive the promised gift, or they will be charged more than just shipping. How These Scams Work
Consumers either receive a spam email or come across a web advertisement or web site from “Walmart” offering a high quality piece of jewelry or other gift in exchange for participating in surveys and paying the cost of shipping.The consumer is taken to a web site that has branding that makes it appear to be a legitimate merchant (ex: Walmart), there the consumer is asked to enter an email address and other personal information, including home address, phone number and credit/debit card numbers. The privacy policy on the site will typically indicate that this information will be sold to other businesses for their own purposes, such as telemarketing and junk mail.Once this information is entered, the consumer may be asked to take part in a series of surveys.Once the surveys are complete (if they were offered at all), the consumer is given the opportunity to select their “free” gift, but it will end up costing the consumer a great deal of money in fees, hidden subscriptions, and unwanted products. In addition, at the end of the process there is no guarantee that the consumer will even receive the gift.
The above example shows several signs of being a typical fraudulent Walmart email, such as an outdated logo and having a PO Box listed as an address. Walmart Practices
Walmart does not solicit online for individuals to complete online surveys for gift cards or free gifts, nor do we send unsolicited emails asking individuals to participate in our surveysWalmart does not endorse and is not affiliated with any "sponsor offer" related program or surveyWalmart will never send you emails or surveys that are contingent on your making purchases, subscriptions, or fulfilling other financial requirementsDrawings for the legitimate Walmart receipt survey occur four times a year. Winners of the register receipt gift card are notified by certified mail, never via emailHow to Protect Yourself
Don't open or respond to unsolicited e-mails offering free gift cards or other giftsDon't click on or respond to online ads or websites offering free gift cards or other giftsPay attention to the website URL. If the URL does not match the branding to a legitimate website navigate away from the websiteTo Report Suspected Sponsor Offer Scams
