DATA PRIVACY NOTICE
The Parochial Church Council (PCC) of The Parish of The Bourne, Farnham
1. Your personal data – what is it?
Personal data relates to a living individual who can be identified from that data.  The processing of personal data is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).
2. Who are we?
The PCC of The Bourne Parish, Farnham is the data controller (contact details are given in section 9).  This means it decides how your personal data is processed and for what purposes. The PCC is a registered charity, number 1127825.
3. How do we process your personal data?
The PCC of The Bourne Parish, Farnham complies with its obligations under the “GDPR” by keeping personal data up to date; by storing and destroying it securely; by not collecting or retaining excessive amounts of data; by protecting personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access and disclosure and by ensuring that appropriate technical measures are in place to protect personal data.
We use your personal data for the following purposes: -

To share your contact details with the Diocesan office or Charity Commissioners where required (see paragraph 5 below);
To comply with the Church’s Safeguarding Policies where appropriate
The Bourne Parish maintains a secure electronic database, using a third-party provider called “ChurchSuite”, which enables us to function more effectively as a church community and ensure personal data is secure and only accessible to authorised users.  Our ChurchSuite account is hosted in the UK and we have chosen to use it because of the ease of use of their software and their compliance with the GDPR.  ChurchSuite also has a member-facing system called “My ChurchSuite”, which (among other features) enables those on the database to manage their own personal information easily, or opt out at any time.  All personal information stored on our ChurchSuite account is backed up securely each day.  If you would like more information about our use of ChurchSuite please email pcc@thebourne.org.uk . For more information about ChurchSuite generally, see their website www.churchsuite.com
4. What is the legal basis for processing your personal data?
We process some data to carry out legal obligations in relation to Gift Aid or under employment law. We also have legal obligations under Canon Law and Church of England rules, including processing data in relation to the Electoral Roll.
Most of our data processing, including contacting you, is carried out as a legitimate interest by a not-for-profit body with a religious aim provided that:-
the processing relates only to members or former members (or those who have regular contact with it in connection with those purposes); and
there is no disclosure to a third party without consent.
For the purposes of this notice members are deemed to include:-
those who are on the electoral roll of the parish
those who worship regularly at one of our churches or halls
those who support the parish financially through regular giving by standing order or via the Parish Giving Scheme
Where your information is used other than in accordance with one of these legal bases, we will first obtain your consent to that use as outlined below:
To obtain your explicit consent to contact you by email or other electronic means so that we can keep you informed about news, events, activities, fund-raising and services and process your gift aid donations and keep you informed about diocesan events.
5. Sharing your personal data
Your personal data will be treated as strictly confidential and will only be shared with other members of the church in order to carry out a service to other church members or for purposes connected with the church. We will not share your data with third parties outside of the parish without your consent.
We have a legal obligation to notify the Diocese of Guildford of the names and contact details of Office Holders such as Churchwardens, Deanery Synod members, PCC Treasurer, Gift Aid administrator, PCC Secretary as well as sharing personal data for the purposes of obtaining DBS checks. We also are required to notify the Charity Commissioners of the members of the PCC.
6. How long do we keep your personal data1?
We keep data in accordance with the guidance set out in the guide “Keep or Bin: Care of Your Parish Records” which is available from the Church of England website [see footnote for link].
Specifically, we retain electoral roll data while it is still current; gift aid declarations and associated paperwork for up to 6 years after the calendar year to which they relate; and parish registers (baptisms, marriages, funerals) permanently.
