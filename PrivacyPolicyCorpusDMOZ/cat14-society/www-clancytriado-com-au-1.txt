Our Founder
In 1976, Patricia Clancy was building up her legal practice when Gough Whitlam's attorney-general Lionel Murphy changed the law.
It also changed her life.
Her firm Clancy and Triado went on to become one of the most prominent in the state handling divorce - notably for female clients - and custody cases.
Later, Clancy was awarded an Order of Australia for services to law, particularly family law.
The Whitlam period "was a very exciting time. Things a lot of people had objected to were so suddenly remedied at the stroke of a pen."
The legal changes fundamentally changed people's lives for the better, particularly women and children, she says.
"We will never go back to the appalling situation that existed before the act, whereby people were forced to stay in dreadful marriages".
