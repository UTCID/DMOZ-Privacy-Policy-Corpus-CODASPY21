PRIVACY STATEMENT
Update: This statement has been updated (17 August 2018) because we have introduced two new analytics tools that will enable us to gather additional (non-identifiable and non-sensitive) information about your use of this site. We adopted these tools to gather the information we need to build better digital services. More information about these tools and the information we collect is available from our Data Collection page.
The Parliament of Victoria recognises that privacy is a major concern of visitors to this site. We only collect non-identifiable and non-sensitive data and we take great care with practices that affect personal privacy.
Email
We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list without your permission.
Links to other sites
This site contains links to other sites. The Parliament is not responsible for the privacy practice or the content of such web sites.
E-Petitions
The collection, storage and use of personal information provided in the e-petitioning process in Victoria is governed by Standing Orders approved by the Legislative Council.
For a Principal Petitioner, the Legislative Council require that the person’s full name and e-mail address is provided and it will be published on the website against the e-petition. Parliament has no control of who will use this email address or how it will be used. The personal details of people who join (or “sign”) e-petitions will not be published on the website.
The Standing Orders require people who join an e-petition to provide their name and Victorian residential address. Prior to tabling, access to this information is restricted parliamentary officers for the purpose of administering the e-petition or operating the e-petition service.
Copies of all tabled petitions, both paper and e-petitions, can be provided on request to the Legislative Council Table Office. A tabled petition, including paper and e-petitions, will contain the name and full address of all people who have signed the petition.
Principal Petitioners may be contacted by Parliament to provide feedback on the e-petitions process.
Data collection for service improvement
In order to improve the quality of its services, Parliament utilises the following website analytics and user survey tools, these include website server logs, Google Analytics, FullStory and Survicate.
In our use of these tools, Parliament takes great care not to collect personally identifiable data. For more information about how these tools operate, the information collected and how you may opt-out is available from Data Collection.
