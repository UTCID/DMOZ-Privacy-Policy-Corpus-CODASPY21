Privacy Policy
What Personal Information About Customers Does PMI Collect?
We receive and store information that you provide us during registration. We keep a physical record of your USPS Form 1583 at our offices. We also maintain electronic records of account preferences such as frequency and duration of use.
Does PMI Share the Information It Receives?
We will never sell, rent, or give out customer names, addresses, or any other personal information. The only circumstance in which we will reveal your personal information and shipping records is if we are requested to do so by the United States government, as we are required to do so by law.
How do you secure my credit card Information?
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Authorize.net (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Authorize.net is an industry standard for online credit card transactions and is highly secure.
If you have any additional questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us via our website by clicking here.  If our information practices change in a significant way, we will post the policy changes here.
