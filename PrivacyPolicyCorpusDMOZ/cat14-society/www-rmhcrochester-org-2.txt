PANTRY PARTNERS
The Pantry Partner Program helps to keep our RMH pantries stocked with items most needed by families utilizing our services.  It is developed to encourage sponsorship and donations of the House Wish List items from local corporations, church groups, schools, families, etc.
You may sign up for a month or a week, whatever works best for you.  Please contact Kathy Campbell at kathleenc@rmhcrochester.org to find out more information.
