Data Privacy & Security
VIEW ATTORNEYS
In today’s hyper-connected world, protecting electronic information and other valuable digital assets has become more critical—and daunting—than ever. Breaches not only seriously affect companies and consumers; they can also expose the affected business to stiff penalties and fines, resulting in a significant loss of revenue and reputation.
Our Data Privacy and Security team guides clients through this challenging landscape. With more than 45 attorneys and scientists possessing computer science, engineering, and healthcare and regulatory backgrounds, we’re able to quickly assess risks, identify gaps and provide advice on data storage solutions.
Planning and Procedures
Working within a company’s competitive framework, we consider its current data practices, goals and corporate culture. With that knowledge, we can then coordinate data audits and develop data protection policies and notices.
An integral part of our process is helping our clients achieve and maintain compliance with myriad federal, state, and international data protection and security laws, including:
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act
Telecommunications Act and CAN-SPAM (Telecommunications and Marketing)
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) (Financial Privacy)
HIPAA and HITECH (Medical Privacy)
Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) (Children’s Privacy)
Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (Educational Privacy)
European Union Privacy Directives (Protection of Personal Data)
