Marketing tabs and pixels – what they are/how we work with them
In addition to using cookies on our website, we also use invisible 1×1-pixel tags, known as 'clear pixels'. These pixels are used to collect statistical information about visitors to our website and the pages they view. Ibec use these pixels to understand what content is popular and how the layout of the website might be improved. Clear pixels are also used in each e-zine and newsletter sent by our system. If you receive the HTML formatted version of our e-zine(s) and/or newsletter(s) and your email is configured to download images, a record of whether or not you open the email (and how frequently you open it) will be saved with your subscriber history. Your engagement with the content of the communication (such as what links you click on) will also be recorded. We use this information in aggregated form to give us an indication of the popularity of content and to help us make decisions about future content and formatting. We may also use the information to publish more content relevant to certain categories of subscribers in future issues and to unsubscribe recipients who have not opened our emails for some time.
