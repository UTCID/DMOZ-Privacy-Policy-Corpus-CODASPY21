To the fullest extent permitted by law, you shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the ACOG Parties from and against all claims arising from or in any way related to your use of the ACOG Web sites and/or ACOG Content, a violation by you of these Terms of Use, or any other actions connected with your use of the ACOG Web sites and/or ACOG Content, including any liability or expense, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorney fees. ACOG will provide prompt written notice of any such claims, but failure to provide such notice will not release you from any of your obligations pursuant to this Section except to the extent that you are actually prejudiced by such failure, and will not relieve you from any other liability that you may have to the ACOG Parties other than under this Section.
20. Term and Termination. These Terms of Use will take effect at the time you begin using the ACOG Web sites. ACOG reserves the right, with or without notice, at any time and for any reason to deny you access to the ACOG Web sites or to any portion thereof, and to terminate these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms set forth herein. You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by ceasing to use the ACOG Web sites, but all applicable provisions of these Terms of Use will survive such termination.

21. Arbitration; Venue. Any controversy or claim (“Claim”) you have arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use shall be resolved by a single impartial arbitrator pursuant to proceedings administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for resolution of commercial disputes.

All submissions to the arbitrator, the proceedings and the award shall be confidential. The arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited basis with minimal discovery. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding. The courts located in the District of Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over (i) any action concerning the enforcement of an arbitration award, or (ii) if arbitration is not permitted by law, then any Claim you have arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use. You agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts and you will not object to such jurisdiction and venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, inconvenient forum or otherwise. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE. ACOG reserves all rights and remedies available to it, in law or equity, with respect to any matter relating to these Terms of Use.
Neither party consents or agrees to any arbitration on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to proceed with an arbitration on a class or representative basis. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. Any claim or controversy as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision’s restriction on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or class wide arbitration shall be brought only in the courts located in the District of Columbia.
22. Governing Law. These Terms of Use and all matters regarding your use of the ACOG Web sites shall be governed by, construed in accordance with, and enforced under the laws of the District of Columbia applicable to contracts made and executed and wholly performed in the District of Columbia, without regard to choice of law principles. Neither the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act nor the United Nations Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods apply and their applicability is expressly excluded. Printed copies of any and all agreements and/or notices in electronic form shall be admissible in any legal, investigative or regulatory proceedings.
23. Waiver and Severability. The failure of ACOG to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent of the law, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
24. Complete Agreement. These Terms of Use, together with any revisions, any Additional Terms or Conditions incorporated by reference, and any Click-through Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between you and ACOG relating to the ACOG Web sites and its use by you, and supersedes any previous written or oral communication regarding use of the ACOG Web sites. The ACOG Web sites are intended to be consistent with and in furtherance of the policies adopted by the ACOG Executive Board.
