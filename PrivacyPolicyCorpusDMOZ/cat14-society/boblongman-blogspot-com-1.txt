TAR 15 -- from an Unexpected source
It seems that a relative of one of the women I know from Stony Brook U is in Tokyo Japan. The woman said that two pairs of Amazing Racers had run past the relative. Didn't say where or what they were doing, so it's not quite a true spoiler. And there were pix, but not shared. Also, she's a Big Brother fan who despises TAR. (:P)That got me thinking: with the wireless technology and the prevalence of Twitter worldwide, can anyone hide anything anymore?
In the case of Amazing Race, the TAR Detectives get such incredible detail on everything, long before anything airs. I don't read spoilers until it airs, but I'm sure Chateau has the airport covered and the camera angles figured, Apskip's got the flight numbers and arrival times, and Neobie's got the leg mapped out.
It's incredible.
But fortunately, they're fans. They love the show and they're sane (as far as any fanship is 'sane'...)
Think what would happen in the hands of people who are, er, less supportive and less sane, like, say, someone who's stalking a star, or trying to undermine a rival, not to mention terrorists or spys or Big Brother fans.
Go to a mountain in Tibet, some monk's Twittering from the next mountain over. Or a tundra location in Yakutia in Siberia -- the bears have their own YouTube accounts.
The amount of evidence can be astounding, and that makes chasing it down for a live event so much fun.
But it's also just a bit scary.
Technology has redefined privacy in a way that makes it impossible to hold as a near-absolute right above all else. It has become what it really was all along - a right to be held in the context of all other rights, and defended as such.
And it is dealt with in the breach more than in fact, in typical human fashion.
How to handle it from there, I don't know.
