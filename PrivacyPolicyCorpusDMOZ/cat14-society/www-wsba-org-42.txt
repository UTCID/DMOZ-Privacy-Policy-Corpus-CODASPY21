Ethics
Updated: Sept. 24, 2020
Professional Responsibility ProgramThe Professional Responsibility Program is dedicated to helping WSBA members fulfill their ethical obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct. The program is staffed by the WSBA Professional Responsibility Counsel who answers inquiries from members received on the Ethics Line, speaks at CLE presentations, and staffs the Committee on Professional Ethics which issues advisory opinions and makes recommendations on amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.The program is also assisted by one other staff attorney, two paralegals, and support staff. The Ethics Line does not handle lawyer discipline, attorney-client disputes, or provide guidance on rules other than the Rules of Professional Conduct.Ethics LineEthics FAQs (answers to frequently asked ethical questions)Advisory Opinions Rules of Professional Conduct:Lawyer RPCLPO RPC (listed under APRs as LP_RPC)LLLT RPC (listed under APRs)To request a written advisory opinion, contact the Committee on Professional EthicsRecent Advisory OpinionsAdvisory Opinion 202001 regarding multi-client representation where lawyer may represent the personal representative in a wrongful death claim and provide legal representation to the statutory beneficiaries.Advisory Opinion 201903 regarding an inactive lawyer having a trust account to receive client settlement checks after retiring from practice.Advisory Opinion 201902 concerning a special assistant attorney general (SAAG) representing a government department in a claim against a third party.Advisory Opinion 201901 concerns lawyer-mediator preparing pleadings for unrepresented parties in dissolution case.
