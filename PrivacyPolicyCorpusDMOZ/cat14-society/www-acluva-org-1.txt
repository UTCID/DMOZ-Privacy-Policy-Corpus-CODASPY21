Technology continues to rapidly evolve and develop in ways that our Founding Fathers could hardly conceive. It is important that our laws keep pace to protect our privacy and to safeguard against government surveillance.  The ACLU of Virginia is working with a broad coalition of advocates who oppose mass surveillance and seek to protect our ability to move and act freely without being watched by Big Brother.
