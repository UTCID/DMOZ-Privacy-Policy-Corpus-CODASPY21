About health care providers
The provider compare feature allows you to easily find the most important information to make health care decisions, like quality data and services provided. The following can help you better understand which provider type is right for you, and the information available.
Doctors & clinicians
Find a doctor or clinician that accepts Medicare near you, or compare doctors who are qualified to practice in many specialties.
Hospitals
Find and compare hospitals that provide services like medical, surgical, and psychiatric care.  Use the “Hospital type" filter to find special facilities like acute care, critical access, children’s hospitals, and more.
Nursing homes
Get detailed information about every Medicare-certified nursing home in the country. A nursing home is a place for people who can’t be cared for at home and need 24-hour nursing care. Find nursing homes based on a location and compare the quality of care they provide.
Home health services
Home health care describes a wide range of health care services that can be delivered in your home at less expense than a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Compare home health agencies using the patient survey star ratings or the quality of patient care star rating.
Hospice care
Hospice agencies most often provide services where you live, whether it’s at home, an assisted living facility, or a nursing home. Find hospices that serve your area and compare them based on the quality of care they provide.
Inpatient rehabilitation facilities
Many patients with conditions like stroke or brain injury, who need an intensive medical rehabilitation program, are transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Find and compare inpatient rehabilitation facilities based on infection rates and more.
Long-term care hospitals
Most patients who need to be in intensive care for an extended time are often transferred to a long-term care hospital to continue that care. Find and compare long-term care hospitals based on important indicators of quality, like how often patients get infections or pressure ulcers.
Dialysis facilities
Get information on more than 7,000 facilities throughout the country. Compare dialysis centers and make a choice based on the quality of patient care they provide. You can also compare their patient experience survey results.
