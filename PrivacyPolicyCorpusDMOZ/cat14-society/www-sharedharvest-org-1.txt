Privacy Policy
Shared Harvest Foodbank wholeheartedly respects the privacy of our donors and site visitors. Personal information is not gathered from visitors to our website just because an individual visits our website. Shared Harvest Foodbank will only gather information if a visitor to this website completes any of the available forms for donation, conduct a food drive or to volunteer.
We utilize Network for Good to process our online donations therefore we do not collect any credit card information.
We do not require you to join our mailing list when visiting our website. Individuals making donations, conducting food drives or volunteers using the form provided online will be added to our mailing list if the individual requests so, on the form.  Rest assured, in the over three decade history of Shared Harvest Foodbank, we have never traded, sold, or shared our mailing list and we will continue to honor that policy.
Data security is very important, and we have instituted appropriate technology and procedures to safeguard the information you may provide to us online.  We use no other technologies normally used to track your movements throughout the internet.  Where you go is your business.
We are especially concerned about protecting children’s privacy and therefore we never collect any information from those who identify as being 13 years or younger.  While children may gather information on our website to learn more about hunger right here at home, no part of our website is structured to appeal to children.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at 800-352-3663 or foodbank@sharedharvest.org. Thank you for your time and for visiting our website.
