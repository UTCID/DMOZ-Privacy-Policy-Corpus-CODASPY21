Pro Bono Safety Project The Safety Project provides high quality pro bono representation to low-income victim survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking seeking civil Orders for Protection (OFP) who have a compelling need for legal assistance. Volunteer attorneys from diverse practice fields represent survivors in proceedings in Hennepin, Ramsey, and Washington Counties.
Legal advocates at domestic abuse agencies refer clients and support the client and the attorney throughout the case. Tubman staff gathers information and screens clients for income eligibility, merit, and need for representation. A Tubman staff attorney provides legal support, case consultation and mentoring. To get started, volunteer Attorneys attend a free half-day training and represent at least two clients per year. A Safety Project case usually requires about 10-20 hours of work, and volunteers are not required to have family law experience. Tubman carries malpractice insurance that covers our pro bono volunteers.
