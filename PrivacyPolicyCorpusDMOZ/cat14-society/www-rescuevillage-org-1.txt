Adoption PolicyWhen it comes to our adoption process, we operate on a strict first-come, first-serve basis. If you see an animal on our website that you are interested in, we encourage you to make your way to Rescue Village as soon as possible. We do not place “holds” on animals under ANY circumstances. Remember, our website is your best tool to see what animals are available. It operates in real time meaning as soon as an animal is adopted, it is pulled from our website. We make new animals available for adoption daily.View Our Adoption Process

Animal-Friendly Menu PolicyRescue Village strives to inspire respect and compassion for all animals, advocate on their behalf, and encourage others to build a more humane community. Consistent with our mission, it is the policy of the organization to serve only vegetarian and vegan fare at Rescue Village sponsored events. This includes both onsite and offsite fundraising, volunteer, and staff functions. Where such policy is impossible or unworkable, these circumstances will be handled on a case-by-case basis.Rescue Village Mission: To act on behalf of animals and inspire people to build a more humane communityView Upcoming Events
