Healing Hands International ("HHI") recognizes the importance of protecting information we may collect from donors and visitors to our site. Our policy is to use the information for internal purposes only, and we maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private.
Donors and website users need not reveal any information about themselves. If one chooses to give us personal information for the purposes of correspondence, processing an order, or providing a subscription to a publication, then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.
If donors or website users tell us that they do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact, we will respect those wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.
HHI takes precautions to keep donor and website user information secure. Donor information, whether collected online or offline, and website user information will not be sold or shared with any third party, nor will HHI use that information to send mailings on behalf of any third party. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
