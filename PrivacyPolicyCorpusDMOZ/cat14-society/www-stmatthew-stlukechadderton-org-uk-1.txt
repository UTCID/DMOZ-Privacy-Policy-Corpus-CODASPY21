Helping with welcome, IT, Media, etc
There are many ways in which you can help us when there's a service or event.  Don't be afraid to offer help, there are plenty of jobs to go round, and we need multiple people to help.
What are your gifts and talents?  Do you want to learn something new - training is available for all roles within the life of the church.  Don't be afraid, give it a go, you might be surprised.
