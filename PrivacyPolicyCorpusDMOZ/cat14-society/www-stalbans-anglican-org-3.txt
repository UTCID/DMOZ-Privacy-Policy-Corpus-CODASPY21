Privacy and Cookies Policy Notice
This policy notice summarises how the St Albans Diocesan Board of Finance (SADBF), as Data Controller, uses and protects any personal information that is collected or is provided to the SADBF by you as the Data Subject, for the purposes of undertaking diocesan duties supporting the mission and ministry of the Church of England. A more detailed policy description can be found in the Data Privacy Policy.
The SADBF is committed to ensuring that data subjects’ privacy is protected. If a data subject is asked to provide information by which they can be identified, when holding a position within the Diocese or using this website, they can be assured it will only be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
The SADBF may change this policy notice from time to time by updating this page. Data subjects should check this page and the Data Privacy Policy to ensure that data subjects are happy with any changes.
Personal information
Contact details and information about posts that people hold, which appear in the Online Directory, are provided directly from the Diocesan database, which is maintained through the parish annual return process, the database portal and the normal business processes of the SADBF.
These contact details may, depending upon the role/posts that are held, be used to maintain contact with the parishes by distributing information on events and activities and when requesting statistical and financial information relating to the parish or church the data subject is connected to.
The Online Directory exists to help enquirers contact their local church and also for clergy and parish officers to easily contact their counterparts around the Diocese. However, data in the Diocesan database relating to schools is not displayed in the Online Directory and only school headteachers names and general school contact details are published in the Diocesan printed directory.
Any personal details submitted through the events or jobs sections of this site are used only for the purposes of administration of those activities or adverts.
Controlling data subject’s personal information
The SADBF will not sell, distribute or lease data subject’s personal information to third parties unless we are required to do so by law.
It may be shared within the structures of the Church of England and other ecumenical partners within the Diocese and nationally.
This data may be published in the publicly available Diocesan Directory and Website with consent. In this case the data subject will be contacted and sent a link to a website page where they will be asked for their consent and for them to control which part/s of their data is made publicly visible.
Data subjects may, under the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018, request details of personal information which the SADBF holds about them. If a data subject should require a copy of this information they should contact the Data Protection Officer, or for clergy, the Diocesan Bishop’s office.
If a data subject believes that any information that the SADBF is holding is incorrect or incomplete, or wishes to change the use of their personal information, they can request a change at any time by emailing the Database Administrator.
If a data subject believes that the SADBF have not managed their information correctly, the data subject may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at https://ico.org.uk/.
The SADBF keeps data subjects’ personal data secure within EU data centres. It is encrypted and securely held with access granted only to those that have an operational or Diocesan business need to do so.
