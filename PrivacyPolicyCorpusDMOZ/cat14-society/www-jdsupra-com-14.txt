The submission of digital evidence traditionally required a sponsoring witness—something that could be time-consuming and expensive.
Thankfully, as more and more online content, such as social media posts and chats, play a role in legal matters, amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence have also made the authentication and submission of digital evidence much easier.
This webinar will look at what it means to submit digital evidence under FRE 902(13) and (14). It will examine:
How FRE 902(13) and (14) streamlines evidence authentication and submission
The requirements of digital evidence under FRE 902(13) and (14)
How to authenticate evidence with a hash value (digital signature)
The importance of collecting associated metadata
Software solutions for effective collection and authentication
