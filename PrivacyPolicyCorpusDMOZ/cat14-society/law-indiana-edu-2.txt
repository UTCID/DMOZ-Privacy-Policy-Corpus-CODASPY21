HomeAcademicsJD degreeLegal writingThe FallThe FallThe fall semesterIn the fall, along with the basic 1L doctrinal courses (Contracts, Civil Procedure, and Torts), you値l take the first half of Legal Research and Writing (LRW), a four credit-hour progression spread over two semesters. LRW meets twice a week in small class sections羊oughly 20-25 students in each. You値l stay with the same group and the same professor for both semesters, so your professor will get to know you really well.This course is where you put into practice the doctrine and theory you池e learning in all your classes. Playing the role of a junior attorney at the front end of a client representation, you値l work with realistic client documents to identify legal issues and research the law. But since legal analysis involves much more than merely looking up the law, you値l also learn how to use existing law to predict the outcome in novel situations, and you値l learn to communicate your analysis in a typical law-office format. That format, the predictive legal memorandum, is one that you値l almost certainly be expected to use in your first internship.
