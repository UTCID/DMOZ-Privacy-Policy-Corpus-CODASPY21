A dispute in relation to an estate can be challenging and stressful. Our private client attorneys are adept at efficiently managing all facets of contentious matters arising from contested wills, trusts, powers of attorney and when a person dies intestate.
We are known for our ability to be fair but firm in advocating for our client’s interest. We have a well-earned reputation for staunch representation with the courts and counsel throughout Michigan.  Our team is comprised of dedicated litigators with the experience to:
Administer decedents’ estates of all sizes and types
Handle will and trust contests, claims against estates, and probate disputes
Provide representation in contested guardianship and conservatorship proceedings
Prosecute or defend claims of undue influence, lack of capacity, conversion of assets, fraud and constructive trusts
We routinely provide strategies that bring amicable solutions to difficult situations.  Our ability to use facilitative mediation to reach agreement before going to court or as soon as possible once a proceeding is commenced saves clients time, money, and the emotional toll associated with trial proceedings.
