EMPLOYMENT LAW UPDATES
Punitive Damages in Ontario Employment Law - Pate Estate v. Galway-Cavendish and Harvey (Township)American courtroom dramas and John Grisham novels tend to skew Canadian views on what punitive damages are and how they are awarded.The Ontario Court of Appeal’s November 2013 decision inPate Estate v.

Ivanov, it is now clear that the nearly-universal pronouncements by management lawyers as to the death of Wallace damages after Honda and Keays may have been a bit premature.In Slepenkova, the Ontario appellate court upheld a two-month notice extension for an employer's bad faith termination, even though no evidence was led at trial as to the specific damages the employee directly incurred as a result of the bad faith. This appeared to place the trial Judge's decision at odds with the new Wallace test set out in Honda.Read more...
