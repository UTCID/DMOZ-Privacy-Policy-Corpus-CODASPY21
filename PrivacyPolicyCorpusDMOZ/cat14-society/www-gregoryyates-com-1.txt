Information Provided by You
We collect and store information that you provide to us through our interactions with you, including through our websites, in our properties, through our customer service representatives, at events, through mobile applications, through marketing efforts, including contests, sweepstakes and events, and through third parties. We may also receive information about you from other brands within the The Law Firm of Gregory A. Yates, P.C.family of brands.
You may elect not to provide certain information, which could result in you not being able to take advantage of certain capabilities of this website, our mobile applications or other services we offer.
For example, you must provide certain personal information in order to place an order or to register for an account on or through our website.
We may request, collect and store some or all of the following types of personal information: your name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial and payment information, including your credit card number and expiration date, gender, personal interests, date of birth, and any information about a third party you provide when we ship an order. We may maintain a record of your product interest and purchases. If you access our website or mobile applications with your log-in credentials from a social networking site (e.g. Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter) or if you otherwise agree to associate your account with us with a social networking site, we may receive personal information about you from such social networking site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of such social networking site. We may add this to the information we have already collected from you via other interactions.
When you download or use our mobile applications, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services like local store information, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow users to disable location services by using controls located in the device’s settings menu.

Automatically Collected Information
We collect and store certain other non-personally identifiable information automatically whenever you interact with us. For example, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser information and reference site domain name when you visit this website.
We may analyze this data for preferences, trends, and site usage statistics.
We may also collect information by using cookies, web beacons, and related technologies in order to analyze and understand how the website is used and to improve your visits to the website. For example, we may use cookies and related technologies to: (i) customize account pages for you, (ii) track user visits and account features, (iii) determine what features and pages are most frequently requested or visited, and (iv) save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit the website.
“Cookies” are small text files that a website sends to a user’s hard drive through the browser for data storage. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. By disabling or otherwise rejecting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on this website. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this website.
We use third-party companies to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our website and to evaluate the effectiveness of our website and promotions so that we can improve and optimize our website and the products and services we offer. We use third-party companies to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf throughout the Internet. These companies use tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) to collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website and your interactions with our products and services.
This information helps third parties deliver tailored advertisements to you and others on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers throughout the Internet based on your interests and browsing of our website (remarketing). We use third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) to better understand and advertise to audiences that visit our website. We do not use or associate personally identifiable information with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds, or other anonymous identifiers.
Our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize “Do Not Track” signals, but several of the third-party companies who utilize these cookies or beacons enable you to opt out of this advertising. If you wish to opt out of receiving this third-party interest-based advertising, you may obtain more information HERE. Please note this does not opt you out of receiving marketing communications from us.
Some of our e-mail communications to you may include a “click-through URL” linked to a particular page on the website. By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter our website and we may collect information related to the “click-through.” You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on URL links in our e-mail communications.
We also use a variety of retail analytics tools in our stores for operational and marketing purposes, such as measuring and analyzing traffic patterns. These tools collect data from sensors, including video cameras, smartphone detectors, Wi-Fi networks, or other devices, to evaluate and improve your in-store experience.
Information from Other Sources
We may collect information about you from third-party sources and information that is publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network site) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances. Another example is that we may receive demographic information about you from a third party to make our service and marketing efforts more efficient and personalized for you.
How is your information used?
We use the personal information we collect to communicate with you, analyze and develop our business, and to improve our products, services, and interactions with customers. We, or third-party service providers we engage, may use the information to process and ship orders, provide products and services that you have ordered or requested, send order and shipping confirmations, provide customer service, respond to your comments, questions or complaints, personalize your interactions with us, identify your preferences and shopping habits, analyze trends and statistics, create, administer and fulfill our contests and other promotions, evaluate and improve the website and our products and services, and prepare and send you marketing communications and other information regarding our products, services or special events. We also use your information for business purposes such as security, legal compliance, payment processing, analytics, operations, fraud detection, reporting, and making back-ups.
You always have the choice not to receive marketing communications. For instructions on opting out of those communications, please review below the section entitled “How Do I Indicate Whether or Not I Want to Receive Promotional Communications?”
NOTE: We do not use a 3rd party blog app, and when we launch our blog (soon), I plan to have comments turned off.
