Privacy Policy
Rochester Area Mensa (RAM) respects your privacy.  This document outlines the ways that the Rochester Area Mensa website may collect information from you.
Browsing the Site
Generally speaking, you can visit the pages of the Rochester Area Mensa website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information, but there are portions of the Rochester Area Mensa website that do request personal information.
Member-Only pages
Some sections of this website are reserved for Rochester Area Mensa members only.  To access the members-only pages of the site, you will need to enter your member ID and password.  You may also need to have cookies enabled in your browser.  This information is used to confirm that you are a member in good standing before displaying these limited-access pages.
NOTICE:  The information in the members-only section is for the use of American Mensa members only.  This information must not be shared with nonmembers of American Mensa.  No permission is granted to use any personal information for promotional purposes or for any purposes not directly related to Rochester Area Mensa or American Mensa, Ltd.
Web Forms
Other portions of the site require personal information in order for you to complete certain activities such as contacting Rochester Area Mensa or requesting information.  These pages will ask you to enter personal information such as your name, mailing address, phone numbers, and/or email address.  The information that you type in these forms is necessary to complete the action for which the page is used.
NOTICE:  Information from potential members may be distributed to local chapters to provide information about local member benefits and activities and to arrange testing as necessary.  For our young members, we require parental consent to distribute more information than name, city and state within the organization.
Cookie Policy
The Rochester Area Mensa website uses cookies to provide members-only access to certain portions of the site as well as to complete online transactions.  A cookie is a text file stored on your computer that includes identifying information that can be retrieved later.  To increase security and privacy, American Mensa uses "session" cookies only - that is, the cookies from the American Mensa website work only during your current visit.  Information is not saved for future visits.

The Rochester Area Mensa website includes links to other websites.  Rochester Area Mensa is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites.  You should always read the privacy policy at a website before revealing any personal information.

As an organization, Mensa has no opinions.  Mensa has no ideological, philosophical, political, or religious views or affiliations.
But as individuals, we tend to make up for it:  Mensans usually have two or more opinions on any given topic.  Bright people have the ability to view almost any issue from several perspectives, often simultaneously.
