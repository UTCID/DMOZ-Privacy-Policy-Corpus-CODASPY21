About CAP Action and purpose of AmericanProgressAction.org
CAP Action is an independent nonpartisan policy institute that is dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans, through bold, progressive ideas, as well as strong leadership and concerted action. Our aim is not just to change the conversation, but to change the country.
As a tax-exempt organization, CAP Action is prohibited from supporting attempts to influence the outcome of any election for public office. Accordingly, with AmericanProgressAction.org, CAP Action seeks to provide a forum to discuss policy—not to advance the interests of any particular political party or candidate for office.
