In the United States and in the State of Connecticut there are laws to ensure that
municipal government is open and transparent. Pursuant to those laws, the public
has access, with limited exceptions, to information obtained and held by the Town of
Cheshire. Consequently, while information collected and held electronically will be
afforded the same protections as non-electronic information, such information will be
available to the public unless its disclosure is limited by state or federal law.
