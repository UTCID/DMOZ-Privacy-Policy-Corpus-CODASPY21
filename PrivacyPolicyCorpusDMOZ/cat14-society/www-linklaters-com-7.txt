Accordingly references in the Legal Notices and elsewhere on this website to “Linklaters” mean Linklaters LLP and the other partnerships and affiliated firms or entities authorised to carry the name “Linklaters” or one or more of those affiliated firms or entities as the context requires.
Before 1 May 2007, “Linklaters” was a general partnership constituted under the laws of England and Wales. Some documents on this website were produced before 1 May 2007.
