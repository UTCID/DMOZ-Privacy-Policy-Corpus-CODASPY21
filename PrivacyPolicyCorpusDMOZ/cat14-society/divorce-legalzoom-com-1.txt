100% Satisfaction Guaranteed

The LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee
In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your
satisfaction with our
services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the
best
legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us
immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for
future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:
If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at
1-888-203-7652
during our normal
business hours.
All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your
request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you.
Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees
or
taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any
money
paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated
with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request
this exchange and
complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item,
less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties
with
a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made
directly
by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible
for
exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if
a
replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in
each
case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the
original
form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the
applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular
procedure. For instance,
the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's
service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is
complete.
Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our
legal
plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not
covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee
only covers
satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.
La Garantía de Satisfacción de LegalZoom
Ademas de ciertas garantias contempladas por ley, LegalZoom garantiza su satisfaccion
con nuestros
servicios y asistencia tecnica. Dado que nuestra empresa fue creada por abogados experimentados, nos
esforzamos por ser el mejor servicio de documentacion legal en la web. Si usted no esta satisfecho
con
nuestros servicios, comuniquese con nosotros inmediatamente y corregiremos la situacion,
suministraremos
un rembolso u ofreceremos un credito que puede usarse para pedidos de LegalZoom en el futuro.
Detalles de la garantoa de satisfaccion de LegalZoom:
Si usted no esta satisfecho, simplemente llamenos a la linea gratuita
1-888-203-7652
durante nuestros
horarios comerciales ordinarios. Todas las solicitudes hechas en virtud de esta garantia deben
hacerse
dentro de 60 dias de su compra. Procesaremos su solicitud dentro de 5 dias habiles despues de que
hayamos recibido todos los documentos y materiales enviados a usted. Desafortunadamente, no podemos
rembolsar o abonar ningun dinero pagado a entidades gubernamentales, como por ejemplo cargos de
registro
o impuestos, o a otros terceros que cumplan una funcion en el procesamiento de su pedido. Tampoco
podemos rembolsar ningun dinero pagado por usted directamente a terceros, como por ejemplo pagos
hechos
por usted directamente a abogados afiliados con nuestros planes de asistencia juridica o productos
asistidos por abogados.
Si usted desea cambiar el producto que pidio por uno diferente, debe solicitar este
cambio y completar
su pedido de remplazo dentro de 60 dias de su compra. Se abonara a su cuenta de LegalZoom el precio
de
compra del articulo original, menos cualquier dinero pagado a entidades gubernamentales, como por
ejemplo honorarios de registro o impuestos, o a otros terceros que cumplan una funcion en el
procesamiento de su pedido. Todos los pagos que usted haga directamente a abogados afiliados con
nuestros planes de asistencia juridica o productos asistidos por abogados no son directamente
elegibles
para cambio o credito. Cualquier diferencia de precios entre el pedido original y el pedido de
reemplazo
o, si no se completa un pedido de reemplazo dentro de 60 dias de su compra, se acreditara el precio
de
compra original completo (en cada caso menos cualquier dinero pagado a entidades gubernamentales u
otros
terceros) a la forma de pago original. Si usted pago su pedido original por cheque, LegalZoom puede
enviar por correo un cheque por el monto correspondiente a su direccion de facturacion.
Recuerde que no podemos garantizar los resultados o la conclusion de su procedimiento
particular. Por
ejemplo, el gobierno puede rechazar una solicitud de marca comercial por motivos juridicos ajenos al
alcance del servicio de LegalZoom. En algunos casos, la acumulacion de pedidos gubernamentales puede
llevar a extensos retrasos antes de que se complete su proceso. De igual forma, LegalZoom no
garantiza
los resultados o las conclusiones de los servicios prestados por los abogados de nuestro plan de
asistencia juridica o nuestros productos asistidos por abogados. Este tipo de problemas son ajenos a
nuestro control y no estan cubiertos por esta garantia.
Dado que estamos dedicando tiempo y esfuerzo a la preparacion de sus documentos
juridicos, nuestra
garantia solo cubre problemas de satisfaccion ocasionados por LegalZoom, y no cubre cambios a su
condicion o su estado de animo.

At LegalZoom.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. All information provided for
the completion of your case online will be guarded according to the standards in effect at the time
the information is provided. Information will not be released for any commercial or other purpose.
Information provided will only be used as necessary for the administration and maintenance of this
site.
I. Security Measures Concerning Your Personal Information
While transmission of information over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we make
every effort to provide protection for the information that we collect about you. Our site uses
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology in the transmission of logon identification and passwords. SSL
technology provides advanced encryption tools that convert the information you input into code
before it is sent to us. This encryption helps protect you and the information in your account.
In addition to SSL technology:
-Your personal information is password-protected. It is our policy never to sell information about
our users to third parties without user permission. See "Use of Collected Information" below.
-Advanced firewall technologies protect our database from outsiders.
However, to avoid unauthorized use of your account by others, you must also take steps to control
your password. Further, this site contains various links to other Web sites. LegalZoom
is not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. You should not assume that other sites
take similar steps in securing your information and should evaluate their privacy standards before
using their systems.
II. Collection of Information
When you register with LegalZoom.com, we ask that you provide your name and e-mail address.
In the course of your use of the site, we will request additional information from you that is
necessary to complete your document kit.
In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information including your IP
address, what browser you are using, and the URL you just came from. We also collect information
about your use of our site in order to optimize our site usability.
We use cookie technology to assist users in navigating through our site more efficiently. Third party
affiliates may also set cookies on the site for the purpose of tracking leads. A cookie is a small
text file that resides on your hard drive. At various points on our site, our system will request
the cookie from your browser so that we can retrieve the stored information. The cookie may be
linked to a unique number that our system can read to determine your user ID and preferences. This
prevents you from repeatedly making the same selections. Knowing how you use the site enables us to
better tailor content and services to your needs. The cookie does not contain information that
others could use to personally identify you, and other Web sites cannot access the information we
store on your computer. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically
deleted at the end of a session. You must set your browser to accept cookies to be able to use our
site at this time.
III. Use of Collected Information
The primary reason that LegalZoom.com collects information from its users is to assist users
in preparing their legal documents.
LegalZoom.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We use your
information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, and
improve our site's content, offering, and layout. Your IP address may be used to help diagnose
problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to address security needs. Law Form Pro
may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site
information to third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying
information.
We may use the information we collect to notify you about the status of your LegalZoom.com
account, important functionality changes to our Web site, new LegalZoom.com services, and
special offers we think you'll find valuable. We may also contact you to verify your information, or
ask you about your experiences with our system.
Except for communications that relate directly to the service being provided, you may "opt out" of
receiving communications from us. Communications needed for document preparation include (1)
confirmation of your registration, (2) notifications of errors that need to be corrected, and (3)
notifications regarding the status or completeness of your order. To opt out of non-required
communications, check the appropriate boxes when you register or at any time by logging into the
system and modifying your profile information.
When it is necessary to contact you, we will use your email address and (in some situations) your
mailing address, phone or fax number. Note: LegalZoom.com will not ask you for your
password if we contact you. Do not disclose your password if asked by a caller claiming to
represent LegalZoom.com.
IV. Consent and Changes to This Policy
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by LegalZoom.com.
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are aware of
what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If we make
any material changes to how we disclose personally identifiable information to others, we will
notify you by email and provide you at least ten (10) days to object to such disclosure and to
delete your registration.

and Privacy Policy, each of which is incorporated herein by
reference.

directory listings, and (iii) third party limited scope agreements. At no time is an attorney-client
relationship fostered or created with LegalZoom.com Inc. through the performance of any such services.
This Site and Applications are not intended to create any attorney-client relationship, and your use of
LegalZoom.com Inc. does not and will not create an attorney-client relationship between you and LegalZoom.com Inc..

legal document service.

6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION
Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.
Summary:
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our Customer
Care Center at
1-888-203-7652.
In the unlikely event that the LegalZoom.com Inc. Customer Care Center is unable to
resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if LegalZoom.com Inc. has not been able to resolve a dispute it
has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding
arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is less
formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for
more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Any arbitration
under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not
permitted. While in some instances, upfront costs to file an arbitration claim may exceed similar costs to
bring a case in court, for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, LegalZoom.com Inc. will pay all
costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you may recover attorney's fees from LegalZoom.com Inc. to the
same extent or more as you would in court.
Under certain circumstances (as explained below), LegalZoom.com Inc. will pay you more than the amount of the
arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorney's fees if the
arbitrator awards you an amount greater than what LegalZoom.com Inc. offered you to settle the dispute.
You may speak with independent counsel before using this Site or completing any purchase.
Arbitration Agreement:
(a) LegalZoom.com Inc. and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us before a single arbitrator.
The types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted. It applies,
without limitation, to:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract,
tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;
claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to
advertising);
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of
a certified class and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "LegalZoom.com Inc.," "you," and "us" include our
respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns,
as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms
or any prior agreements between us.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This
arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
entering into these Terms, you and LegalZoom.com Inc. are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
participate in a class action. These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and
thus the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This
arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.
(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of
Dispute ("Notice") to the other party. A Notice to LegalZoom.com Inc. should be addressed to: Notice of Dispute,
General Counsel, LegalZoom.com Inc., ADDRESS_COMPANY DUMMY (the "Notice
Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the
specific relief sought ("Demand"). If LegalZoom.com Inc. and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim
within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or LegalZoom.com Inc. may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by LegalZoom.com Inc. or you shall not be
disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or
LegalZoom.com Inc. is entitled.
You may download or copy a form Notice from
www.legalzoom.com/arbitration-forms.pdf.
You may download or copy a form to initiate arbitration from the AAA website at
www.adr.org
(c) After LegalZoom.com Inc. receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will
promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $75,000.
(Currently, the filing fee for consumer-initiated arbitrations is $200, but this is subject to change by the
arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, LegalZoom.com Inc. will pay it directly after receiving a
written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute
Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA
Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be
administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879. (You may obtain information about the arbitration process directed to non-lawyers, including
information about providing notice to LegalZoom.com Inc., at
www.legalzoom.com/arbitration-information.pdf.)
The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. All
issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and
interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph
(f) are for the court to decide. Unless LegalZoom.com Inc. and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
take place in the county (or parish) of your contact address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may
choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If you
choose to proceed either in person or by telephone, we may choose to respond only by telephone or
submission. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a
hearing. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on
which the award is based. The parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party
will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other
arbitration of any dispute or claim to which LegalZoom.com Inc. was a party. Except as otherwise provided for
herein, LegalZoom.com Inc. will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration
initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either
the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment
of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse LegalZoom.com Inc. for
all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In
addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at more than $75,000 (excluding
attorneys fees and expenses), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
(d) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an
award that is greater than the value of LegalZoom.com Inc.'s last written settlement offer made before an
arbitrator was selected, then LegalZoom.com Inc. will:
pay you either the amount of the award or $2,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and pay
your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness
fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim
in arbitration (the "attorney's payment").
If LegalZoom.com Inc. did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you
and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively,
if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes
as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees
at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's
ruling on the merits. In assessing whether an award that includes attorneys fees or expenses is greater
than the value of LegalZoom.com Inc.s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in his or her
calculations only the value of any attorneys fees or expenses you reasonably incurred before LegalZoom.com Inc.s
settlement offer .
(e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorney's
fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under
applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you
may not recover duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs. Although under some laws LegalZoom.com Inc. may
have a right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration proceeding,
LegalZoom.com Inc. will not seek such an award.
(f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only
to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND LegalZoom.com Inc.
AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS
PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless both you and LegalZoom.com Inc. agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to
the claimant and would not affect other customers. Neither you nor we may seek non-individualized relief
that would affect other customers. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of
this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must
be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
(g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either
party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal
within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. An award of injunctive
relief shall be stayed during any such appeal. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected
according to AAA rules. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty
(120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel
shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.
(h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any
future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice address, website link or
telephone number provided herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of which we had written notice
on the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this arbitration provision, any such
termination will not be effective until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination
is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of
termination.
