Data protection
The owner of this site takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. I have https server but most of the site does not collect any personal information that it is needed.

The webpages of the site contain Google Analytics java script which provides data about which pages are accessed, how long and much of the same information that the server collects. This information is compiled and available to me from their websites.
