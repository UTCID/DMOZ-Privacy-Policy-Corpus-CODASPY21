Certificate in Information Privacy Law
The Certificate in Information Privacy Law is designed to prepare students for careers in the fast-growing fields of information privacy and cybersecurity. There are only a few other J.D. Information Privacy Law Certificates currently being offered in the U.S.
The program is open to current J.D. students and consists of four components:
Experiential Learning:  Students complete the experiential learning component by completing a privacy-related externship or working at a pre-approved job focused on privacy issues. Maine Law also has the Center for Law + Innovation Privacy Law Fellow Program offered in partnership with the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).  Students in the Fellows Program are guaranteed an internship at the IAPP between the summer of their first and second year of law school.
Coursework: Students meet the coursework requirement by completing Information Privacy Law, the Information Privacy Summer Institute, and a selection of several other elective courses totaling nine credits.
Writing Project on a Privacy Related Topic: Students satisfy the writing requirement by publishing a paper on a privacy-related topic in a publication read by privacy professionals.
Certification from the IAPP:  At graduation, a candidate must have one of the following IAPP certifications in good standing: CIPP, CIPM, or CIPT.
Faculty and experts involved in the Certificate Program include Professors Peter Guffin, Christine Davik, and Rita Heimes.
