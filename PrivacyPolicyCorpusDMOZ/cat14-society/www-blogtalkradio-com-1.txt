Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Updates to the Terms Of Use and Privacy Policy
We truly care about people's privacy, which is why we're introducing new platform updates that grant
major personal information control and data protection and have updated our Terms accordingly.
We ask you to review the new TOU and PP and accept the changes in order to continue using our
products. Here are some of the highlights of what's changing:
On May 25, 2018, a new European Union (EU) data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), takes effect. The GDPR gives individuals in the EU more control over how their personal data is
used and set specific limitations on businesses processing users' personal information. In short, we
will not retain your personal information unless it is completely necessary for using the service, we
will grant permanent personal data deletion if the account gets deleted and we will raise service access
to 16-year-old people and older.

Terms and conditions of sale
Purchase
Paid services
Blogtalkradio provides for additional services or subscriptions available upon
payment of a fee. The fees, duration and conditions for the accounts and
paid services are highlighted in the relevant section of BlogTalkRadio.
Recurring subscription
Payments start from the date when Users choose a paid subscription or modify
another existing payment plan. The subscription must be renewed at each billing
cycle to maintain the benefits provided by the paid services.
Automatic renewal
Recurring subscriptions are renewed automatically through the payment method that
the User chose at the time of purchase. The renewed subscription will last for
an equal period of time as the original service period. Users may cancel
automatic renewal at any time by changing their preferences for the payment
method used. If the User cancels an automatic renewal, then BlogTalkRadio may be
forced to cancel their subscription when it runs out.
Methods of payment
Blogtalkradio uses third-party tools for its payment processing and is not
connected with any of the provided payment information – such as the credit card
– in any way.
Any declined payment costs shall be borne by the User.
Right of withdrawal for European Consumers
According to the applicable European consumer protection law, in case of purchase
of services the European Consumer has the right to terminate the Agreement,
within 14 days days from the date the Agreement is entered into, without giving
any explanation. For the purpose of exercising the right of withdrawal, the
Consumer is obliged to inform the Owner, without any formality, of the decision
to withdraw by sending an unequivocal statement to the address set out in this
document. For the purpose of this communication, the Consumer can use the
withdrawal form available at the bottom of the Agreement.
Any reimbursable amount will be returned by the Owner without undue delay, and in
any event within 14 days of the notification of withdrawal by the Consumer,
using the same means of payment used by the Consumer for the initial
transaction, unless the Consumer has expressly otherwise agreed.
Limitations to the right of withdrawal
Notwithstanding the above, the Consumer acknowledges and accepts that the
right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts for the supply of services
after the full performance of the service by a professional if the
performance initially began with the express consent of the User and their
agreement to lose the right to withdraw. Therefore, if the European Consumer
has made a purchase on BlogTalkRadio and the Service provided by the Owner
is immediately provided so that Consumer has immediate access to the use of
the relevant Service, the withdrawal right shall be no longer actionable.
The User also acknowledges and agrees that the withdrawal shall not apply to
the supply of digital content through a non-material medium once the
execution of the agreement has begun with the express consent of the
Consumer and their acknowledgement of the loss of the right to
withdrawal. This means that whenever a European Consumer purchases digital
items from within BlogTalkRadio, the withdrawal right shall be no longer
actionable.
Refund and order correction
The User can ask for a refund or order correction only if:
the User is charged for items that they did not purchase or
they do not receive the items they did purchase or
they are charged the incorrect amount.
Refund requests shall be processed provided that they are received within 24
hours from purchase. Refund requests received past 24 hours from purchase shall
be evaluated at the Owner's sole discretion.
EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED CASES, NO REFUND SHALL BE PROVIDED FOR ANY
PURCHASE MADE.

the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright

for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each
category of recipient; and
for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information
categories obtained by each category of recipient.
The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected
or used over the past 12 months.
If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be
"portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the
information to another entity without hindrance – provided that this is technically
feasible.
The right to request the deletion of your personal information
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information,
subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to,
where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to
detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to
exercise certain rights etc.).
If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete
your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.
How to exercise your rights
To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request
to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.
For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are.
Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request
which must:
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are
the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized
representative;
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and
therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to
you.
If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person
registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under
your parental authority.
You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
How and when we are expected to handle your request
We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide
information about how we will process your request.
We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more
time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In
this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.
Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such
request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a
reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate
our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
