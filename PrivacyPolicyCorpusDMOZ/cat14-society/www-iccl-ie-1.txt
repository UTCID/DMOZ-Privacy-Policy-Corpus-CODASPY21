DonateFind out how you can support our vital workHome / Privacy and Information Rights
Your right to respect for your private life is a core human right, and is central to your enjoyment of freedom of expression and association, as well as freedom of thought and
conscience. You must be free to conduct your personal life as you see fit without worrying that you are being observed or monitored.
We
all have the right to the protection of our personal information. This includes the freedom to know what information has been compiled about you – be that by government, by state agencies or by corporations.
But these fundamental rights are under threat, both online and off. They
are under threat from State surveillance and from private sector use of
your personal data.
ICCL is based in Dublin, a European data and technology hub, making the protection of these basic rights even more urgent. The protection of privacy and information rights in Ireland (and therefore across Europe and the globe) is one of our main priorities, and we are always growing our expertise and capacity in this area.
Help keep privacy and information rights top of ICCL’s agenda. Donate today.
