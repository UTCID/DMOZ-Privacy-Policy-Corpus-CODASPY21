Privacy Policy
Client Privacy
Health Care for the Homeless is committed to protecting our clients' health information. Our Notice of Privacy Practices explains how all staff members of Health Care for the Homeless will safeguard your privacy. You will receive a copy of the Notice of Privacy Practice at your first appointment, and annually thereafter. You can also request one from any front desk staff member, or review it here.
We have chosen to participate in the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, Inc. (CRISP), a statewide health information exchange. As permitted by law, your health information will be shared with this exchange in order to provide faster access, better coordination of care and assist providers and public health officials in making more informed decisions. You may “opt-out” and prevent searching of your health information available through CRISP by calling 1-877-952-7477 or completing and submitting an Opt-Out form to CRISP by mail, fax or through their website at www.crisphealth.org.
Website privacy
Our site may contain links to other sites that are not managed or maintained by Health Care for the Homeless, Inc. The inclusion of a link to another site from HCH does not imply any endorsement of that site's privacy policies, practices or content. Your dealings with these sites are covered only by the privacy policies listed on those sites.
Why does Health Care for the Homeless ask for my information?
In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personal or business information.
What information does Health Care for the Homeless collect?
We do not collect personal information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis (typically for donation purposes, email updates, or participation in our fundraising events). We will never track your activities electronically.
Does Health Care for the Homeless use cookies?
We do not use cookies on any of our sites – though third party vendors (such as Google) may store your login information for easier retrieval at a later date.
How will Health Care for the Homeless use the information I provide?
We will always explain the extent of its use at the time you are asked to provide personal information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt out."
Does Health Care for the Homeless rent, share, sell or trade my information?
Health Care for the Homeless does not rent, share, sell, or trade e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. In addition, we do not rent, share, sell, or trade information about what activities or donations supporters have undertaken on our website.
Can I change the information I have given to Health Care for the Homeless?
If you are a Health Care for the Homeless constituent, you can update your account information through one of the following methods:
Send correspondence to the following postal address:
Attn: Development
Health Care for the Homeless
421 The Fallsway
Baltimore, MD 21202
Call us at (410) 837-5533.
E-mail info@hchmd.org or chocolateaffair@hchmd.org.
You can change the information associated with your online subscriptions by visiting our subscription center. You will need the email address at which you receive messages from HCH to access your account.
How do I know my credit card information is secure?
Health Care for the Homeless uses secure server software (SSL) that is the industry standard and is among the best available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. In the event of an unauthorized charge to your credit card you must:
Write to the creditor at the address given for "billing inquiries," not the address for sending your payments, and include your name, address, account number and a description of the billing error.
Send your letter so that it reaches the creditor within 60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed to you.
How does Health Care for the Homeless use my e-mail address?
Health Care for the Homeless uses its e-mail list to provide news, action alerts, and other information to subscribers and does not sell or rent its e-mail lists.
Health Care for the Homeless collects e-mails based on an opt-in process, based on information you provide.  You may opt-out of e-mails at any time by clicking the "Manage Subscription" link at the bottom of e-mails.
