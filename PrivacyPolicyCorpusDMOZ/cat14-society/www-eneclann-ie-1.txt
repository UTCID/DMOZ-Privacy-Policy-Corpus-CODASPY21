We are not responsible for any content on anyone else’s website, even if we link to it.Sometimes things happen that disrupt your service, which we have no reasonable control over. Examples are fires, floods, strikes, workmen putting shovels through our internet connection cable and other “acts of God”. Obviously, as we can’t control or plan for these things, we can’t be liable for any losses that they cause you.Customer support and complaintsWe really believe in Customer Support and always aim to fix problems where we can: quickly, and in a friendly way. If you have a question, suggestion or complaint, please contact our Customer Support team first and we’ll do our best to sort it out.VATVAT is at the current Irish rate.
