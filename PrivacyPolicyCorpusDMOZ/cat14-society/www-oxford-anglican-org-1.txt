Its officers are appointed, and its work is governed by a large number of statutes and measures, notably the Ecclesiastical Judges and Legal Officers Measure 1976. Under orders made by the General Synod, the Registry’s work includes (but is not limited to)giving general legal advice to clergy, parish officers, boards and councils throughout the Dioceseassisting clergy and answering parishioners’ enquiries relating to marriagefunctions as Registrar of the Diocesan Synodconsecration of churchyardsoperation of the faculty jurisdictionSuch advice is given free of charge to parishes and diocesan officers. It is always best to ask for advice from the Registry sooner rather than later, as legal problems, if left unaddressed, can become increasingly difficult to resolve.Advice request form (Word : printable pdf)Most of the staff at the Registry are also qualified solicitors, practising as Winckworth Sherwood, a national law firm with particular involvement in the not-for-profit sector, as well as extensive involvement with the Church of England at a number of levels.Church & Churchyard AdviceFaculty Jurisdiction (see also DAC)Churchyard Regulations and MemorialsMetal Theft GuidanceChancel Repair LiabilityAlcohol Consumption in ChurchyardsMaintenance of Closed ChurchyardsForm for leaving a legacy to your churchWorks Affecting Monuments and Memorials in Churches and ChurchyardsFaculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015 – Oxford DAC guidance noteOnline Faculty Application System – Oxford DAC Guidance NoteMarriage AdviceMarriage in the Church of England (Guidance for Clergy)General Register Office Guidebook for the ClergyMarriage Registers and Certificates (Updated 2018)Marriage Registration Changes 2019 (Not yet implemented)Marriage Certificate Fees 2019Marriage Surrogates List  (Updated June 2020)Arrangement of Banns Banns of Marriage and how to avoid an emergency common licenceChurch of England Marriage Measure 2008House of Bishops Guidance for Marriage MeasureMarriage (Amendment) Measure 2012Immigration Act 2014 – Implementation DateMarriage of Foreign NationalsMarriage of Foreign Nationals Post 2 March 2015Letter to Superintendent Registrar for applicationsGuidance for Letter to Superintendent Registrar for ApplicationsMarriage of EEA Nationals post BrexitGuidance where a British National does not have a valid passportDivorce Documentation for MarriagesMarriage in Church after Divorce StatementFilming Weddings, Baptisms in ChurchesGuide to charging for a weddingPCC AdviceThe Data Protection Act 1998: A Guide for ParishesLegal Status of Parochial Church CouncilsKeep or Bin…?
