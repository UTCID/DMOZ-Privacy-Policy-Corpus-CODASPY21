Domain Dispute Masterclass Episode 10: Privacy Services, the GDPR and the UDRP
In episode number 10 of my YouTube masterclass on domain name disputes, I discuss how a trademark owner can file a complaint against an unknown registrant under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP).Watch the video below or on the GigaLaw YouTube channel. As I explain, the “Whois” database is the starting point for identifying the registrant of a domain name, but this database is often unhelpful because some cybersquatters use fictitious names (I cite the case in which I filed a UDRP complaint against “Barack Obama”) or privacy services (such as Domains By Proxy) to hide their identities. Plus, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has resulted in redacted records in many cases.As a result, as I discuss in the video, trademark owners may face challenges in their UDRP complaints, which may lead to additional efforts such as amendments and other steps to identify the so-called “underlying registrant” of a disputed domain name. In any event, no matter what obstacles a cybersquatter may try to create, a trademark owner does not need to let any of these obstacles prevent it from filing and successfully pursuing a domain name dispute.To watch previous episodes, visit “Domain Name Disputes: A Masterclass by Doug Isenberg.”
