Ramsey Solutions Privacy Policy
Our Policy Behind Our Privacy Policy
The Lampo Group, LLC d/b/a Ramsey Solutions® (“Ramsey Solutions,” “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy, and in doing so, we want to make sure that this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is clear and concise enough for you to understand it. We hope that as you read through the Policy, you will become comfortable using the sites. Our intention was not to make this a lengthy Policy with pages and pages of text for you to read through, but we wanted to make sure that you were given enough information to put your mind at ease about your privacy. We hope that you will take the time to read the information and learn how Ramsey Solutions is here to help you. After all, we created this Policy for the sole purpose of protecting your privacy and the information you provide to us.
This Policy discloses our privacy practices and how we may use the information that we gather on the digital properties, including websites, mobile applications, et al, of Ramsey Solutions (the “Sites”), and our web-based services, or that you provide to us through other means. By using the Sites or voluntarily providing personal information to us, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Policy. This Policy applies solely to information collected by the Sites and contains the following:
What constitutes personally identifiable information that is collected from you through the Sites, how that information is used and with whom the information may be shared;
What choices are available to you regarding our use of your data;
The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information; and
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information collected.
Respecting the privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. We realize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created this Policy to show you the steps we have taken to maintain that trust and secure your information. Please take a few moments to read this Policy carefully.

Sharing of Information
There may be times when we need to share your personal information with third-party service providers.  The reasons we may need to share this information with those providers are due to the services they provide, which include:
Authorization of debit card and check transactions, order fulfillment, service promotions;
Developing, hosting or maintaining the Sites on behalf of Ramsey Solutions; and
Aggregating customer information and/or improving customer service. We may then share such aggregated information with prospective marketing partners and advertisers.
These third-party service providers are only granted access to your personal information, as necessary, and they are contractually restricted in the ways they may use your information. The providers may also use cookies (as defined within this Policy), or other automatic collection technology on behalf of Ramsey Solutions.
Moreover, in the event that a division, or part or all of Ramsey Solutions, is purchased, sold or otherwise transferred, or is in the process of a potential transaction, customer information will likely be shared for evaluation purposes and included among the transferred business assets.
Ramsey Solutions may also be required to disclose specific information to comply with the law, a subpoena, or other litigation process. We may also disclose your information to protect the interests or safety of its visitors and customers, employees or others, which includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Your payment information is temporarily stored on a secure server before processing. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us.

At a minimum, we encourage you to make sure that you are using a secure browser as you surf the Internet.

The Sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy and security, we are not responsible for the privacy practices used by other sites.
