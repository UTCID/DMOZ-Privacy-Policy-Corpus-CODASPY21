SECURITY & PRIVACY STATEMENT
Effective November 20, 2002
I. General Information About Our Privacy Practices
FastTrack Fundraising Company is strongly committed
to protecting the privacy of our users and maintaining a secure online
environment for our online fundraising programs. Our Privacy Statement
covers our World Wide Web sites found at:
http://www.FastTrackFundraising.com
This Privacy Statement is effective as of the date written above and is
designed to meet the following principles and practices:
We fully disclose what information is collected on our sites and how
we use that information;
Campaign organizers, participants and supporters who participate in
our online campaign programs may choose whether they want to continue
to receive communications from us;
We provide our registered campaign organizers with access to their
account information and the ability to modify that information; and
We are dedicated to creating a secure environment for user information
and use an advanced network server security system to safeguard user
information.
In the more detailed description of our privacy practices below, when
we use the term "you," we are referring to registered campaign
organizers, participants, supporters and general users of our web sites
who order campaign products or information from our web sites. When
we use the term "personal information," we are referring to
a user's first and last name, address, telephone number, and e-mail
address.
Violating our privacy policy is cause for termination
of your campaign. In addition, FastTrack Fundraising company reserves the
right to cooperate with municipal, state and federal officials in any
law-enforcement investigation requiring either personal information or
reports about lawful or unlawful user activities on this site.
II. FastTrack Fundraising Sections
Information Collected Through the Traditional Fundraising Programs
We offer traditional campaign program products
through FastTrack Fundraising. You may order free samples of products online,
or request that a consultant contact you to take your campaign program
order. You may also call our toll-free Order Desk to order your free samples.
If you choose to submit orders or requests online, you will need to provide
us with the necessary fulfillment information through our online order
or request form. All personal information you submit to us through
FastTrack Fundraising will only be used by us and our third-party suppliers
and transactional companies for the purpose of fulfilling your order or
request. FastTrack Fundraising may contact you with informational updates and
communications, which you may always opt-out of as described below.
Information Collected Through FastTrack Fundraising's Website
Registration Information
In order to use our services, and/or to receive
a free information kit, campaign organizers must complete an online registration
form or call our toll-free number at 1.866.432.7838. When registering
online or by phone, campaign organizers need to supply contact information,
relevant affiliation(s), and details related to their fundraising campaign.
We collect this information from fundraising campaign organizers to assess
the organizer's fundraising needs and to respond to them with information
relevant to their request.
III. Specific Information Pratices For All FastTrack Fundraising Sites
Order Information
To purchase or order sample campaign products
through any of our sites, you will need to provide order information (which
may include credit card information). If you are purchasing campaign products
from us, once your credit card has been approved by our third-party transactional
company for the amount equaling the total of the supporter's desired purchases,
the third-party supplier(s) will receive all relevant purchase details
(item description, quantity, etc.) needed to fulfill the order. All personal
information collected during the ordering process is used solely for order
processing, billing and shipping.
Information Sharing
As detailed above, FastTrack Fundraising company
does not give your personal information to third parties not associated
with our campaign products or services. Our third-party suppliers use
a variety of external delivery companies to ship orders, and a third-party
firm processes the campaign supporters' credit cards for goods purchased.
These companies, by contractual agreement with us, are not permitted to
retain, store or use personally identifiable customer information except
for order processing and fulfillment.
