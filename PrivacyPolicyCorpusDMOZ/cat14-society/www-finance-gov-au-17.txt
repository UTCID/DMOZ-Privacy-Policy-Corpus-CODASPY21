Financial reporting for Commonwealth entities
Legislative authority
All Commonwealth entities are required to prepare annual financial statements in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) or other legislation that established particular entities.
The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR) sets out the financial reporting requirements for Commonwealth reporting entities. All Commonwealth reporting entities are required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with the PGPA Act, the FRR and the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) and/or other entity-specific legislation.
More information on the PGPA Act, the FRR and the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 is provided in the Overview of Commonwealth financial reporting.
For guidance on specific accounting and financial reporting policies, refer to the Technical accounting policy and guidance.
