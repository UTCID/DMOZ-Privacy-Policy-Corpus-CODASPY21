Privacy Policy
Knobbe, Martens, Olson & Bear, LLP (“Knobbe,” “we,” “our” or “us”) has developed this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) out of respect for the privacy of our clients, website visitors and other individuals who share personal information with us. This Policy describes the personal information we collect, use, and disclose about individual clients, website visitors, and other individuals who attend events organized or hosted by us.

Use of cookies and other tracking technologies
Cookies are small files that a Website may transfer to a user’s computer that reside there for either the duration of the browsing session (session cookies) or on a permanent (until deleted) basis (persistent cookies) that may be used to identify a user, a user’s machine, or a user’s behavior. We make use of cookies on our Website under the following circumstances and for the following reasons:
To enable users to log in to secure areas of our Website;
To compile data about site traffic to offer a better Website experience; and
To understand and save visitor preferences for future visits.
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set if they do not want web services to collect information about their online activity. However, there is currently no universal standard for sending and receiving DNT signals. Due to this lack of universal standard, it would be impossible for us to promise that we comply with all known and unknown DNT standards.
Therefore, we do not respond to DNT signals or other mechanisms that provide a choice regarding the collection of personal information about activities over time and across different Web sites or online services. If a universal standard for DNT becomes available, we may revisit our DNT Policy.
By using our Website you consent to the use of cookies as described in this Policy. If you wish to withdraw your consent, you can disable cookies on your device at any time by activating the setting in the preferences or options menu in your browser. However, disabling cookies may limit your ability to use our site. You can find more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org and more information about deleting or blocking cookies at www.aboutcookies.org.
Your Rights as a California Consumer
If you are a California resident, you have the following rights:
The right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we identify to you (a) the categories of personal information we have collected, disclosed or sold about you in the last 12 months, (b) the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected, (c) the business purpose for which we use this information, and (d) the categories of third parties with whom we share or have shared your personal information in the last 12 months (the foregoing shall be referred to hereinafter as a “consumer request”);
The right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you, free of charge, the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months;
The right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we delete personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions;
The right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties;
The right to designate an authorized agent to submit one of the above requests on your behalf; and
The right to not be discriminated against in receiving different or less favorable pricing, service or financial incentive for exercising any of the above rights.
How to submit a consumer request
You can submit a verifiable consumer request to know or request for deletion of your personal information by any of the two options below:
Submit an online request via email to privacy@knobbe.com.
Call our privacy toll-free line at 888-417-7444.
How we will verify that it is really you submitting the consumer request
When you submit a consumer request through one of the methods provided above, we will ask you to provide some information in order to verify your identity and respond to your request. Specifically, we will ask you to verify information that can be used to link your identity to particular records in our possession, which depends on the nature of your relationship and interaction with us. For example, if your sole interaction with us was as a website visitor, then in order to verify your identify, we will need to ask you to provide your name, email, phone number, IP address, device ID, browser ID, and/or cookie ID.
How to authorize an agent to act on your behalf
You can authorize someone else as an Authorized Agent who can submit a consumer request on your behalf. To do so, you must either (a) execute a valid, verifiable, and notarized Power of Attorney or (b) provide other written authorization that we can then verify. When we receive a consumer request submitted on your behalf by an Authorized Agent, that person will be asked to provide written proof that they have your permission to act on your behalf, and we will also contact you and ask you for information to verify your own identity directly with us and not through your Authorized Agent.
Responding to your consumer requests
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 additional days, or 90 days total, from the date we receive your request), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Our Website is not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may provide any personal information on the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information on this Website. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

How we protect the information that we collect
We employ reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the personal information that we collect.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
