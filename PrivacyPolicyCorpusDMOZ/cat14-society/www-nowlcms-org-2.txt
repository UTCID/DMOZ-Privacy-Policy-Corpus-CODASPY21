Northwest District of the Lutheran Church Missouri SynodPrivacy NoticeLast updated May 18, 2020Keeping the faithThe Northwest District of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (“the district,” “we,” “us,” etc.) is a nonprofit Christian organization that provides services and resources to The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (“LCMS”) congregations, LCMS schools, LCMS ministries, LCMS Recognized Service Organizations and constituents located in Oregon, Alaska, Washington, Idaho, and one congregation in Hong Kong so that they may live as fully committed followers of Jesus. We offer information and opportunities to gather, in person and online, to celebrate our beliefs and faith. We also help maintain, in support of The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (“the Church,” “LCMS,” or “synod”), a nationwide placement database for LCMS Rostered workers, looking for guidance with their careers within the Church, along with continuing education resources for those leaders. The Northwest District also supports workers who are on the Minister of Religion – Ordained and Minister of Religion – Commissioned rosters of the LCMS.These efforts, to connect constituents with one another – or to jobs and education – require us to collect personal information about Web site visitors, registrants, teachers, pastors, and church leaders who use our tools and services. When it comes to handling your personal information, we want to reassure you that it’s being handled in a responsible way. This Privacy Notice is part of our effort to achieve that.When you visit our Website (http://nowlcms.org/) to search for congregations, events, resources, or guidance; share your faith-based experiences on our story page; or sign up to receive our monthly newsletters and information on our podcasts, you will share your personal information in various ways. Sometimes we collect it directly from you. Other times, we use technology to automatically collect personal information. We may also receive your personal information directly from the LCMS.  In all cases, you can be confident that we will handle your personal information lawfully and faithfully, with an eye toward protecting your rights. We also want to give you the necessary tools and options to manage your personal information as you see fit.This Notice applies to our Website and any sites or services that display these terms. It does not apply to any website, mobile app, or service that does not display or link to this Privacy Notice or that contains its own privacy notice. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Website or services. By accessing the Website or using our services, you agree to this Notice.How we collect personal informationWe may collect personal information from you directly or indirectly. When you fill out a form on our Website (to sign up for our newsletter or podcasts, for example), you provide personal information directly to us. Other times, personal information is collected automatically as you use our Website. In addition, we also may receive personal information from third parties with whom we partner.We collect personal information when you provide itWhen you subscribe to our newsletter or register an account with us, you will provide personal information that may include your name and email address. When you create an account with us, you will also create a username and password, information that on subsequent visits helps us confirm your identity and makes it easier to use our services.You may also provide personal information to us at events or by phone and even through old-fashioned mail when you correspond with us. Besides collecting your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address, we may also take or receive photographs of you at conferences and other events we either sponsor or help moderate that we share on our Website or through social media posts.We collect personal information from third-party sourcesWe may collect personal information about you (that you have provided) from certain third party vendors, such as our software provider ACS Technologies who helps us with our data management efforts and donation and registration payment processor Vanco who provides information about donations made to us and event registration. We also use Constant Contact, an emarketing firm, to manage our database of constituents and disseminate our newsletters and podcast information. Note that when we share your personal information with a third party, we require that third party to protect the information consistent with this Notice and limit use of the information to performing the services they provide to us.As you are likely aware, we work with other LCMS Districts across the United States, and the LCMS, to help maintain a national database of openings for internships, paid positions, and educational opportunities within the LCMS. Constituents who are seeking those kinds of opportunities will voluntarily share personal information that may include their names, contact information (mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers), gender, and education level. That information is maintained by the LCMS and is shared with LCMS seminaries, LCMS schools, LCMS congregations, LCMS districts, and LCMS Recognized Service Organizations (“RSO”) in the United States.We also may collect personal information from online social networks if you take part in a public conversation, for example, by posting on Facebook. We may collect personal information when you click “Share This” or “Like” buttons or otherwise use social media buttons or plug-ins. We sponsor social media pages and posts, and we moderate conversations and virtual meetings on those platforms. We also encourage sharing via social media “throwback” photos of constituents to encourage celebrations and remembrances of faith. We recommend that you become familiar with the privacy policies of any social network you visit or use as their terms of use and privacy policy govern any information you post on those networks.The payment processors we work with for conferences and other events we organize or support, typically gather your personal information when you pay to attend them. That information includes but is not limited to your name, address, e-mail address, and credit card information. The information shared with us is limited to your name, email and a very limited amount of financial information (the last 4 digits of your card, the type of card used (Visa®, Mastercard®, etc.) and the name on the card) so that we may confirm your registration.  It should be noted that the payment processor is not covered by this policy, but by the payment processors’ privacy policy and terms of use so please refer to those when using that service.We collect personal information using automated technologiesSometimes personal information is collected by automated technologies and shared with us when visitors navigate through our Website.
