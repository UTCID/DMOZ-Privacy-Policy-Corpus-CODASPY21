Legal ClinicsTubman’s clinics provide you with the opportunity to obtain legal advice from volunteer family law attorneys regarding divorce, custody, child support, child protection, and LGBTQ family law issues. The attorneys will explain your legal rights, review your court documents and provide you with advice. Volunteer attorneys offer private, individual 20 to 30 minute meetings that are held both on and offsite. Pre-registration is required and the cost is $15 if you prepay, $20 if you pay at the door, or free for low-income individuals. Interpreters are available on request. Call 612.870.2426 for more information.
Note: Due to COVID-19, clinics are being held over the phone and the fee is temporarily waived.
