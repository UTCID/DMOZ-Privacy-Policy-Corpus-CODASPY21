PRIVACY
As a condition of your use of iPetitions, you agree to abide by the terms of our Privacy
Policy. You agree to respect the privacy of all visitors and signers of your petition and not to
disclose any information acquired from them without prior consent. The sole exception to this rule, as
per our Privacy Policy, is when you are presenting the petition
to its intended recipient. At that time, and only on one single occasion, you may present a
disaggregated list of signers. You will not use any information collected from your petition for
marketing or other mass email (spam) purposes without the explicit consent of your signers. IN NO EVENT
SHALL THE COMPANY, ITS PARTNERS, OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY
DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL,

OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY AND MAY
BE HELD IN BREACH OF IPETITIONS' TERMS OF USE.
PLEASE NOTE: In line with its Privacy Policy, the company may at
its sole discretion share personally identifiable information (including but not limited to name, email,
and IP information) if it believes such sharing to be legally necessary. Such sharing may occur in
direct response to a request from a legal authority or without a direct request if we believe such
sharing to be legally warranted. In the event we respond to a specific request, we may at our sole
discretion waive the requirement of service of summons and respond to a request received in a verbal,
emailed or other fashion. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY, ITS PARTNERS, OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO ANY
USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR LOST PROFITS) RESULTING FROM VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY
ARISING FROM YOUR PETITION, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND
WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
TERMINATION AND ACCESS RESTRICTION
The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate your access to any or all Angle
Three Associates or iPetitions Sites/Services and the related services or any portion thereof at any
time, without notice.
The Company may also terminate or suspend your access to iPetitions Site/Service(s) for inactivity, which
is defined as failing to log into a particular service for an extended period of time, as determined by
the Company. Upon termination of the iPetitions Site/Service, your right to use the iPetitions
Site/Service immediately ceases.
JURISDICTION
The Company makes no claims that the Materials are appropriate for any particular purpose or audience.
Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online
conduct and acceptable Materials. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding
the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
You are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES
The website may contain links to third party Web sites ("Linked Sites"). The Linked Sites are not under
the control of the Company and the Company is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site,
including without limitation any link contained in a Linked Site, or any changes or updates to a Linked
Site. The Company is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link
does not imply endorsement by the Company of the site or any association with its operators. You are
responsible for viewing and abiding by the privacy statements and terms of use posted at the Linked
Sites.
Any dealings with third parties (including advertisers) included within the iPetitions website or
participation in promotions, including the delivery of and the payment for goods and services, and any
other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are
solely between you and the advertiser or other third party. The Company shall not be responsible or
liable for any part of any such dealings or promotions.
PETITION HOSTS
We make every effort to ensure that individuals or groups hosting petitions at iPetitions respect these
Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. However, we cannot assume
responsibility for any violations of these Terms of Use or our Privacy
Policy by users. In the event of a concern that a petition host may have committed a violation,
we encourage you to contact us directly. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY, ITS PARTNERS, OR ITS SUPPLIERS
BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR LOST PROFITS) RESULTING FROM
VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY OR TERMS OF USE ARISING, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER
LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
EDITS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS
The Company offers its users tools to edit the text of petitions. These tools are intended to be used only
for light edits and minor changes or additions/deletions. If in the opinion of the Company a user substantially
edits a petition so as to change or misrepresent its original meaning, The Company reserves the right to remove
a petition or suspend an account. This right may be exercised at the sole discretion of The Company.
PAYMENTS, CONTRIBUTIONS AND DONATIONS
At several points on the website (notably but not limited to the home page and the page users see after
signing a petition) the company may ask its users to consider making a payment, contribution or donation
to the Company (collectively, “Payments”). These Payments are entirely optional and are never required
to join iPetitions as a member or to sign a petition. They are what allow the company to offer a free
service to thousands of users around the world. It is always clearly stated that the Payment is directed
toward the Company and not to the petition hosts or their associated causes. IN AGREEING TO THESE TERMS
OF SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE COMPANY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST SUCH PAYMENTS AND THAT
THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH PAYMENTS SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY MAINTAINED BY THE COMPANY AND NOT BY ANY USER OF
IPETITIONS OR OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY.
VIOLATIONS
Please report any violations of these Terms through our Contact page.
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the
invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
