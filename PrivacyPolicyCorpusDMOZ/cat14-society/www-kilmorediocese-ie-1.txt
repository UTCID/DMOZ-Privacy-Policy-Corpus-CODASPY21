Safeguarding Children Policy
Safeguarding Children Policy in the Diocese of Kilmore
As a constituent member of the Catholic Church in Ireland we recognise and uphold the dignity and rights of all children and are committed to ensuring their safety and well-being, and will work in partnership with parents/guardians to do this. We recognise each child as a gift from God, and we value and encourage the participation of children in all activities that enhance their spiritual, physical, emotional, intellectual and social development. All Church personnel (including clergy, religious, staff, volunteers) have a responsibility to safeguard children through promoting their welfare, health and development in a safe and caring environment which supports their best interests and prevents abuse.
