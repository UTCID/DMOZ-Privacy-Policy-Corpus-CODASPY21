We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your "Account"); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.PRINCIPLES OF THE JOOR PRIVACY POLICYJOOR does not rent or sell your Personal Information. We don't share your Personal Information with anyone except to comply with the law, to provide a service you have requested, to protect our rights, or as provided in this Privacy Policy. We don't store Personal Information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our Services.WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERSThis Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services") that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.We value the privacy of your Personal Information, and we have accordingly addressed the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR gives individuals in the EU more control over how their data is used, and it places certain obligations on businesses that process Personal Information of those individuals. We have updated this Privacy Policy to take into account the requirements of the GDPR.WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.ACCOUNT INFORMATIONJOOR collects Personal Information, such as your email address, when you create an Account with JOOR to use the Services. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous.USER CONTENTSome features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account, unless the content contains Personal Information, in which case you can request that the content be provided to you and/or deleted. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.IP ADDRESS INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLYJOOR receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request in order to operate the Services. JOOR may use analytic tools or services to view aggregate statistics about the usage of the Services. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser. IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including: To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP. To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers. To estimate the total number of users visiting the Services from specific geographical regions.COOKIESA cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. JOOR uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:Access your information when you "sign in".Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using the Services.Keep track of your design file choices.Store credentials you may use to enable posting to other sites.Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.Conduct research to improve JOOR's content and services.Since JOOR uses cookies to track, diagnose and service technology problems reported by our users or engineers, if you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use the parts of the Services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.
