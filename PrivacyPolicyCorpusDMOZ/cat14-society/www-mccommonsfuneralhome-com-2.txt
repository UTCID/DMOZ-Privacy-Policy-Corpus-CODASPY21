Hancock Avenue Athens, GA 30601 1-800-772-1213 706-227-1195InsuranceBring insurance policies with you to the funeral home. We will provide all claim forms and fill them out free of charge for you. You will need a Death Certificate for each different insurance company. ALL policies (even those that have lapsed) should be examined, seeking any extended coverage. All policies on the lives of the survivors should be examined to determine changes in beneficiaries.Retirement investments - Stocks, Bonds, IRAs, Pension Stocks - Stocks in the deceased’s sole name require probate action. Stocks owned jointly may be transferred to the surviving owner by presentation of a certified copy of the Death Certificate to each company in which stock is jointly owned. A broker or banker can assist you. Federal and state tax questions are best answered by an attorney or tax advisor. Bonds - A SINGLE OWNERSHIP BOND is part of the estate and will be paid or re-issued to a qualified person. BENEFICIARY (one owner, payable on death to a beneficiary). The bond becomes property of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies first, no action is required unless a new beneficiary or co-owner is added. Proof of death is required for redemption or re-issue. CO-OWNERSHIP (two names on the bond). The survivor becomes the owner; a beneficiary or co-owner may be added. An attorney or banker should be consulted. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) - Under IRS regulations, an IRA may be established through a bank, insurance company or broker. At death any amount in the account will be paid to the beneficiaries. Consult your attorney, insurance agent, banker or broker.Real EstateThe services of an attorney are advisable in ALL real estate matters. Real estate owned jointly by husband and wife is automatically transferred to the survivor, but a certified copy of the Death Certificate should be filed with county authorities in connection with the real estate deed. Real estate owned solely by the deceased or as a tenant in common, or jointly with someone other than husband or wife, must be probated whether or not there is a will. Federal and state estate and gift taxes should be thoroughly researched by an attorney.Bank AccountsThe survivor of joint bank accounts can usually withdraw from the account without legal procedure. In large estates there may be federal and state taxes requiring releases from government officials. Bank accounts in the sole name of the deceased will usually require probate action. For small accounts, some banks have forms that permit payment of the balance toward funeral expenses if no other assets require probate. An attorney or bank will answer specific questions.Safety Deposit Box Depending on your bank’s policies a safety deposit box held jointly or in the deceased’s sole name, may be sealed until a county, state or bank official can take inventory. The bank must know the date of death, interest of person making inquiry, whether the key is available and whether the box was rented in the deceased’s sole name or jointly with others.Automobile Title If the deceased was sole owner of a car or trailer, it is part of the estate. Transfer of title information can be obtained from an attorney or the Tax Commissioner’s Office.Candace T.

An attorney will answer specific questions.Cemetery DeedBring your cemetery deed or proof of lot ownership to the funeral home with you. This will assist in marking the grave for the deceased. If the cemetery space is already marked with a tombstone it may not be necessary to bring the deed. Also bring the name and number of the Cemetery caretaker who can assist us in marking the grave.Cemetery Markers and Related ItemsIf you need to purchase a cemetery marker, coping, gravel, any cemetery related merchandise or have the death date cut on a stone, we will be glad to get you in touch with our representative. We also have sources for lot cleaning and sandblasting. Though most any style cemetery marker is allowed in some cemeteries, there may be restrictions. For instance, some cemeteries that are perpetual care require flat markers because it makes mowing much easier. Most markers are made of granite, marble or bronze and vary in price depending on their size and amount of engraving. It’s important to note that of all the final arrangement decisions that need to be made, this is one that can be postponed. McCommons Funeral Home can help you in the selection of a monument that is right for your family.ClothesClothes for the deceased should be brought to the funeral home. This may include what ever you want the deceased to wear: shirt/blouse, pants, suit, dress and all underclothes (underwear, t-shirt, brazier, hose, slip, socks). Glasses, jewelry and dentures should be brought also. Shoes can be used but are not required. We have a selection of suits and dresses at the funeral home for you to choose from if necessary.FlowersThe casket blanket and family floral arrangements should be ordered as soon as possible. This will allow the florist plenty of time to order flowers.Remembrance itemsAny items that you would like to display at the visitation or service should be brought to the funeral home. These include pictures, hobby items or any meaningful tribute.After CareFew events in our lives are as painful as the death of a loved one.
