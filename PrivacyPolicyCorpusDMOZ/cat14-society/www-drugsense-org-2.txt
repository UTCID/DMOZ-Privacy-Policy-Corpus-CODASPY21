Entire
Agreement. This

governs your use of the Service and completely replaces any prior
agreements between you and MAP with respect to the Service. You may
also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply
when you use or purchase other services from MAP and/or its
affiliated services.
Governing Law.
You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the
Service, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the
United States and by the laws of the State of California without
regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal
jurisdiction by and venue in the State and Federal courts in San
Francisco County, California, and waive any objection to such
jurisdiction or venue.
Dispute Resolution. In the
event of any controversy or dispute between MAP and you arising out
of or in connection with your use of the Service, MAP will attempt,
promptly and in good faith, to resolve the dispute. If MAP is unable
to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time, each party to
this Agreement agrees that any dispute or controversy arising between
any of the parties to this Agreement, or any person or entity in
privity therewith, out of the transactions effected and relationships
created pursuant to this Agreement and each other agreement created
in connection herewith, including any dispute or controversy
regarding the formation, terms, or construction of this Agreement,
regardless of kind or character, must be resolved through
arbitration, which may be initiated by any party to this Agreement.
In any such proceeding, MAP, in its sole discretion, shall choose the
arbitrator or arbitration panel. Each party to this Agreement agrees
to submit such dispute or controversy to arbitration before the
American Arbitration Association in San Francisco County, California.
Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered or appealed in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Any party to this Agreement may
bring an action, including a summary or expedited proceeding, to
compel arbitration of any such dispute or controversy in a court of
competent jurisdiction and, further, may seek provisional or
ancillary remedies, including temporary or injunctive relief in
connection with such dispute or controversy in a court of competent
jurisdiction, provided that the dispute or controversy is ultimately
resolved through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. In any proceeding under this
section of the Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall bear all
costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
Statute Of Limitations. You
agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
claim you may have under this Agreement must be brought within one
(1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of
action is forever barred. MAP may bring claims to enforce this
Agreement at any time.
Severability of Terms; Non-waiver of Terms; Assignment.
If any portion of the Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be stricken and the remainder of
the Agreement enforced as written. If MAP does not exercise or
enforce any legal right or remedy including those contained in the
Agreement or arising under applicable law, this will not be taken to
be a formal waiver or relinquishment of our rights. MAP may assign or
delegate all rights and obligations under the Agreement, fully or
partially.

MAP may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes
to the Agreement, by email or by postings to the Service. MAP’s
