All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to TBC, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Automatically Collected Information
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by TBC.

This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the TBC website.
Use of Cookies
The TBC website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize TBC pages, or register with TBC site or services, a cookie helps TBC to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same TBC website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the TBC features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the TBC services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
TBC secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. TBC uses the following methods for this purpose:
-    SSL Protocol
When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.
