Back to Top
Appeal, or Disability Claim Appeal
When applying for benefits, you will receive a letter from the SSA explaining its determination of your eligibility. If the agency determines that you are not eligible SSDI, then an appeals process exists that includes hearings before ALJs and an Appeals Council.
Back to Top
Application for Disability Benefits
If you were to receive SSDI, then you must complete and sign an initial application. On the application, the SSA will ask you questions about your functionality as well as your disabilities. It may also require verification or evidence of your condition.

Credits, or Social Security Credits
When you work, you earn credits that then count toward your eligibility for future Social Security benefits, including SSDI.

The letter generated by the SSA informing you of a benefit decision.

Family Maximum
The maximum amount of benefits paid to an entire family on a worker’s record.
Back to Top

The tax that is withheld from paychecks for funding Social Security and Medicare programs.
Back to Top
Income
Earnings used to determine benefit amounts including:
Earned Income – Wages and money from self–employment, royalties, honoraria and sheltered workshop payments
Unearned Income – Such as Social Security benefits, pensions, state disability payments and unemployment benefits
In–Kind Income – Income considered to be for food or shelter that you get for free or less than fair market value
Deemed Income – From a spouse, parent or sponsor, which could be used to compute benefits
Back to Top
Listings of Impairments
Many conditions are listed in a manual known as the “Blue Book,” which contains information for about processes through which disability determinations are decided.

Back to Top
Representative Payee

Back to Top
Retroactive Benefits, or Back Pay
To determine back pay, the SSA uses criteria including the date at which you were disabled, the application date and the waiting period, which is the period that takes place between when you apply.
Back to Top
Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
These benefits are available to low-income individuals who have not worked or do not have credits. If you are not eligible for SSDI, then this may be an option for you.
Back to Top
Survivors Benefits
Benefits paid to widows, children and parents for people who died after earning sufficient work credits.
