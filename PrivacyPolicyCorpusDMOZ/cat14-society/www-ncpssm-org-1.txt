We value our members, donors and others who support the National Committee and its work by visiting our websites. We know that protecting personal information is important. This privacy policy applies to all the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare’s websites which include:
www.ncpssm.org
www.entitledtoknow.org
www.thetruthnow.org
www.eleanorshope.org
www.ncpssmfoundation.org
secure.ncpssm.org
www.handsoffmedicare.org
To make our Privacy Policy easy to find, we provide a link to it in the footer of every page of our site as well as in our emails.
What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, message format preference (HTML vs. Text), address and other information. We retain contact information and preferences, but we do not retain or store sensitive financial information we receive from donors, such as credit card and bank account information. Credit card and bank information is never retained in our systems. In the following sections we explain in detail the types of data we collect, how we utilize it and your options in sharing your information.
We adhere to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This is a set of security standards designed to ensure that ALL companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. To learn more information about this industry standard visit www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq.
Security and Online Giving
All information provided to the National Committee is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible to certain qualified employees of the National Committee. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we do our very best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee it.
When we receive a donation online, we also receive personal information and credit card information about the donor. The National Committee may also receive or collect and store a unique identification number associated with your device or your mobile application (including, for example, a unique device ID, Unique ID for Advertisers, Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), MAC address, mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, and depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. This information is used in our website analysis and to ensure we provide the best user experience possible.
With constant development of new online tools, the National Committee reserves the right to amend without notice this Privacy Policy by posting such changes on this site. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. We will post changes here, so please check back periodically. Changes will take effect when posted and your continued use of the site will constitute your agreement to the changes.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP address information to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our site, analyze trends, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Analytics and Reporting
We use analytic and reporting technologies to record information such as Internet domain and host names, IP addresses, click stream patterns and the dates and times the National Committee website and services are accessed. We employ outside vendors who assist in managing, monitoring and optimizing our website to aid in measuring the effectiveness of our advocacy tools, advertising and the user experience on our site. For efficient analytics and reporting we may use tracking codes and cookies.
