Announcement
The SACA ride committee would first of all like to pass on our most sincere thoughts to you and your families to wish that you are safe at this unprecedented time.
Sadly, Coronavirus is impacting every part of life and we’re grateful to all the health care and key workers that are working tirelessly to keep us safe and help those inflicted.
For the first time in the rides history we’ve decided to cancel ride 2020. Pls respect the government guidelines to stay indoors and go out as & when advised.
We’re keen to help the nhs & those impacted in society by the Coronavirus.
Therefore, we’re running 3 exciting challenges suitable for individuals & one specifically for families.
Over 10 days you can walk/run/cycle – preferably indoors or within government guidelines if you plan to head outside.
