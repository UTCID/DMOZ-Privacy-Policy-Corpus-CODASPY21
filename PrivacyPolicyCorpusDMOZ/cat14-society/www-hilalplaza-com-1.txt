Information Sharing and Disclosure
HilalPlaza.com and IqraSense.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
o        We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
o        We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of HilalPlaza.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
o        We transfer information about you if HilalPlaza.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, HilalPlaza.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
HilalPlaza.com displays targeted advertisements based on the page information and content as operated by certain advertising networks. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
o        HilalPlaza.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
