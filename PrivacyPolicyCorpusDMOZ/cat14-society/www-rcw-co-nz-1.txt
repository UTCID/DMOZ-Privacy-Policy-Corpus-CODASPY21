Privacy
Privacy issues are becoming more and more important in the world of social media but also in relation to day to day business. Breaches of privacy can cause serious damage to individuals and to organisations.
How to protect that privacy and how to go about repairing the damage done can be enhanced by engaging a professional experienced in this area, especially raising privacy breaches, dealing with the Privacy Commissioner’s office and lodging and taking claims to the Human Rights Review Tribunal.
