KEEP ON FILE FOR THE FUTURE? RealityShifters collects
personally identifying information only during (i) contest or sweepstakes

and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions,
community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting.
RealityShifters may use such information for its internal purposes,
including but not limited to editorial and feedback purposes. In the event
RealityShifters plans to publicly post any such information on a site,
users are provided prior notification of such posting.
Information submitted at the time of registration or

RealityShifters and may be shared with companies that have been
pre-screened by RealityShifters. If a user objects to such use for any
reason, he/she may stop that use - either by email request or by modifying
his/her registration information online.
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site
transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while
at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by, among other things, saving
your passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is
an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites.
Cookies help make realityshifters.com better, by showing
how and when users use the site. Many content improvements and updates are
based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This
information is most easily tracked with cookies.
Here are some other examples of how realityshifters.com
uses cookies:
A cookie lets the Service remember that you've
registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our
sites. Similarly, if there are any stores within the Service, a temporary
cookie tracks which products you've selected while shopping. The cookie
expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves
you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single
visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your
selections.
The cookie itself does not contain any personally
identifying information although it may enable realityshifters.com to
relate a user's use of the Service to personally identifying information
that has previously been submitted by the user, if any.
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.
These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such
third parties' policies.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If
you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is likely
that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so.
realityshifters.com reserves the right to change this
policy at any time by notifying users, through a notice posted on the
Service or by email, of the existence of a new privacy policy or any
updates.
