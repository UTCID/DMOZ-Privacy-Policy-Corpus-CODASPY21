One Cristiano Ronaldo usually provides enough difficulties for cameramen with his pace and movement on the park, so those filming Nike's latest promotional material must have been cursing their luck to be greeted by two on set on Friday.Thankfully for them, it was only a body double they had to contend with, as the Portugal star took a back seat on set in Turin.  The Juventus forward, 35, whose boot deal with Nike is worth an eye-watering £15million, was shooting an advertisement video to promote his sponsor's new footwear.And there were some VIP guests in the building looking on from the sidelines with Marisa, the daughter of Ronaldo's super-agent Jorge Mendes, in attendance. She is his commercial manager and has been responsible for all his social media activity since 2016.

Ronaldo has a £15m boot deal with Nike and helped promote their new footwear this weekDespite his ageing years, Ronaldo is showing no signs of slowing down... even if he did call on a Doppelganger to fill in for him in some of his scenes.Ronaldo was a key performer for Juventus last season as they won the Serie A title and it was business as usual for him on the opening game of their season last weekend as he scored in a 3-0 victory over Sampdoria.Next up for Ronaldo and Andrea Pirlo's Juventus side is a tricky trip to Roma. Juventus will need the real Ronaldo to show up once again if they are to continue their perfect start to the season.
