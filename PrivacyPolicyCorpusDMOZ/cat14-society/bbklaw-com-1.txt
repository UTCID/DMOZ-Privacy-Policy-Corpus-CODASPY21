Privacy & CCPA Policy
Privacy & CCPA Policy
Best Best & Krieger LLP values the privacy of its website users. We do not take lightly the responsibility of protecting your personal information. Through this policy, we intend to be transparent about how your information may be collected, used and secured.
California residents have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, also known as CCPA. To learn more about these rights, please click here.
Types of Information Collected and How They’re Used
Through our website, BB&K collects information in two ways: (1) automatically and (2) directly from a website user.
Information Collected Automatically
When you access our website, BB&K collects information about your connected devices (such as a computer, mobile phone and tablet) and how you navigate through our webpages. This type of information includes:
IP address, domain information, browser type and geographic location (as associated with your IP address). Collecting this information allows us to become more familiar with who visits our website, how often they visit and what webpages they visit.
Cookies. Cookies are small files the website places on your hard drive for identification purposes, such as a unique user ID. BB&K uses cookies to keep records of the pages you visit and your activity on our website. This information helps us to evaluate and provide better information and services to our clients and website users. Cookies are also used to improve our website navigation structure. To view our cookie policy, please click here. Please review your browser’s instructions for information on accepting, deleting and managing cookies. If you choose to not accept cookies, you may limit access on our website and the functionality of our webpages.
Information Submitted Directly by a Website User
BB&K provides you the opportunity to agree or decline to give your personal information. We will inform you of the purpose for the collection and do not intend to transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described in the “How We Share Information” section below. If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may transfer that information within our organization or to a third-party service provider as necessary.
BB&K website users will generally submit personal information through:
Website forms (such as our Contact Us, Subscribe and event registration forms). This information is used to either provide a service or communicate with our website users. The information submitted by you may include, but is not limited to:
First and last name
Company, home, postal or other physical address
Telephone number
Email address
Company name
Job title, position or occupation
Industry
Personal interests
Any other information needed to provide a service you requested
By using these forms you also agree to our Terms of Use.
Direct Email. BB&K has direct email links to its legal professionals and staff on its website. Although this information is not sent through the website, it can be retained and used to help process your request. Be advised, sending emails over the Internet may not be secure and should not contain sensitive or confidential information unless the messages are adequately encrypted. No attorney-client relationship is created through your use of this website or sending an email to a BB&K attorney. Unsolicited information sent to BB&K by individuals who are not clients of the firm is not subject to any duty of confidentiality. BB&K and you must agree that there is an attorney-client relationship. Until such a relationship exists, BB&K will assume that any information you send to us does not meet the standard of attorney-client privilege.
How We Share Information
All data on this website, with the exception of event/webinar payments made through our payment processing provider, ClientPay, are housed in a third-party-hosted SQL database with cloud storage. Access to this database is limited to BB&K and its third-party website development team. We do not have access to the financial information used in ClientPay.
We do not sell the information you submit through forms on our website and only share this information, with your consent, with third-party providers for website analytics or when required to complete a service you have requested.
We will disclose your personal information, if required to do so by law, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our website.
How Your Information is Secured and Stored
All data on this website are accessed through certificate verified Transport Layer Security, also known as TLS, and stored encrypted-at-rest. We do not store sensitive personal information, such as financial information, or legal documents on this website.
Children’s Privacy
Children under 16 years old are not the target audience for our website. To protect their privacy, we prohibit the solicitation of personal information from these children. If we receive or discover personal information provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly delete the information.
Links to Other Websites
Our website may contain links to third-party websites. We do not share your personal information with those websites and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of all websites you visit.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change, modify or update this policy at any time without notice, with terms of the old policy subject to the terms of the new or updated policy. Any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information will be posted on this page prior to implementation.
This policy was last updated on June 1, 2020.
If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@bbklaw.com.
California Privacy Policy for California Residents
This privacy policy for California residents supplements the information contained in the Best Best & Krieger LLP general Privacy Policy. This California Privacy Policy only applies to those individuals or households who reside in California. We adopt this policy to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, known as CCPA, and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Policy.
Your Rights Under the CCPA
The CCPA grants the following rights to all California residents:
Right to Know: you have the right to know what personal information BB&K has collected, used, disclosed or sold in the last 12 months, both as to the categories and specific pieces of personal information.
Right to Delete: you have the right to request deletion of personal information held by BB&K and, by extension, a service provider used by BB&K.
Right to Opt-Out: California residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. BB&K does not sell your personal information (as ‘sell’ is defined in CCPA) and therefore does not provide an opt-out option.
Right to Non-Discrimination: you have the right to non-discrimination in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right under CCPA.
Exercising Your Rights Under CCPA
To exercise your right to know and right to delete information, California residents must submit a verifiable request.
You can submit a request in two ways:
By calling toll-free: (844) 999-0649
By submitting an Online form
As a resident of California, you may make a personal information request twice in a 12-month period. BB&K will respond within 10 days to confirm receipt of the request and provide information on how the request will be verified and processed. BB&K will provide a response to the request within 45 days of the verifiable consumer request.
BB&K will not disclose, in response to a Request to Know, your Social Security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health insurance or medical identification number, an account password, security questions and answers, or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics. BB&K shall, however, inform you with sufficient particularity if we have collected this type of information.
Verifying Your Request
For BB&K to respond to your Request to Know or Request to Delete, we must first verify your identity. BB&K may use a third party verification service, or will request you submit verifiable information. The information you will be asked to provide depends on the type of request you make and the sensitivity of the information.
Generally, a Request to Know the categories of personal information held by BB&K will require you to provide two types of verifiable consumer information. The same may apply to a Request to Delete. A Request to Know or Delete sensitive personal information may require you to provide at least three types of verifiable consumer information.
If BB&K is unable to verify the identity of the requesting consumer, information will not be given and you will be notified of this reason for denial in BB&K’s response.
Authorized Agent
If you are submitting a Request to Know or Request to Delete through an authorized agent, BB&K will require you to provide the authorized agent written and signed permission to do so, verify their own identity directly with BB&K, and directly confirm with BB&K that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. These requirements will not apply should you provide the authorized agent with a power of attorney.
Categories of Information Collected
BB&K may collect personal information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
The following table lists the categories of personal information, as defined by the CCPA, that has been collected within the past 12 months, and how this information has been used and shared.
