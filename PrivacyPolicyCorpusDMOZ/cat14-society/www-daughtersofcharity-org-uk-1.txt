Cookie Policy
A new legislation on internet cookies stipulates that web users must be provided with the opportunity to learn how cookies are used on the web sites they visit, and must consent to cookies being utilised. You can be assured that the our Website does not use cookies to track your activity online.
What is a Cookie?
In terms of the internet, a cookie is a small text file which is placed on your computer when you access a web site. The cookie will usually contain information such as; the web site’s name, a user ID, the extent of the cookie’s effect, and a unique number. Cookies will not reveal your identity, or indeed any personal information.
In most cases, on the first occasion that you go to a web site that uses cookies, a cookie will be placed on your computer. Next time you go to that web site, your device (computer/laptop/mobile/tablet/etc.) will search for a cookie that corresponds to this web site, and will send the information held in the cookie back to the site. From there, the web site can identify that you have visited previously. This allows some web sites to alter the information presented to you based on this fact. Using cookies, some web sites may also record how much time you spend viewing certain pages of the site, the pages/links you have selected, and save preferences you have chosen during your visit.
For the most part, cookies bring many benefits to the internet user, especially if you visit some web sites on a regular basis - your preferences are saved so that you don’t have to re-enter or re-select details or options. Additionally, cookies help to improve internet shopping, i.e they are used to remember the items you have placed in your basket before checking out.
Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul use only two types of Cookies:
Session Cookies
Session Cookies are essential for the operation of our website and they expire after each browser session. These session cookies are therefore only temporary.
Persistent Cookies
Persistent Cookies are also used on www.daughtersofcharity.org.uk/ but they do not collect any information which identifies a user.  However these persistent cookies do collect information on how each visitor to the site uses it and records which pages are visited for analytical purposes.  The user cannot be identified only their flow through the website and the pages visited.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This, however, may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
