PRIVACY POLICY OVERVIEW Please review our full privacy policy below – but here are some key points to know:
We may collect information about you in a variety of ways, including: when you provide information to us directly,automatically as you use the Web Site, and from third-party sources.
We primarily use the information collected from you in order to allow you to participate in the Web Site and to communicate information and offers to you (on the Web Site and elsewhere online). We may share your personal information under certain limited circumstances, such as with vendors providing services to us or for legal compliance. We may also share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes where you have consented to such sharing. For more details, click here. California residents should also review the "Your California Privacy Rights"section of this policy.
We work with third-party service providers, including CBS Interactive, to serve and analyze advertisements on the Web Site and elsewhere online and to provide us with information regarding use of the Web Site. Analytics providers, ad network providers, ad agencies, advertisers and similar third parties may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your visits to the Web Site or other online services. Such information may be used to display targeted ads to you. For more information, including opt-out options that may be available to you, please review the “Third-Party Ad Serving & Audience and Traffic Measurement Services” section below.
When you view video content on the Web Site, share information through a social-networking feature on the Web Site, or post to one of the Web Site’s Public Areas, third parties may have access to information on what videos you have watched.

We have adopted commercially reasonable procedures to help protect your information, but please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED The following are the types of information we may collect:
Information You Provide to Us We may ask you to provide us with information through the Web Site, including the following:
Personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you as a specific person, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number, and physical address;
Demographic information, such as gender, zip code, information regarding your education or number of children, or similar information; and
Other information about yourself, such as your interests or preferences.
You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Site. Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name.
We may combine non-personal information with personal information, in which case we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.
Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site’s features.
Note that we may de-identify personal information we have received, turning it into non-personal information. This is sometimes accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.
Information We Collect Automatically on the Web Site
We may collect information automatically when you visit the Web Site, including:
Information about your device, including device type and settings, and browser type and operating system;
Web sites or other services you visited before and after visiting the Web Site;
Areas of the Web Site with which you interact, advertisements you view, and links you click on within the Web Site;
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is a number automatically assigned to your device whenever you access the Internet, or another unique identifier for the device you use to access the Web Site (e.g. Apple’s Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID)). IP address can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area.
Information about your internet connection (e.g., mobile operator, ISP, WiFi connection).
Information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.
Information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded.
When analyzed, this usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.
Information from Other Sources We may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information
Send to a Friend If you send a friend a communication from the Web Site, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent from that person.

CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request certain information from companies conducting business in California relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as we do, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers a choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Company provides you a choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in at the time Company offers that choice, Company does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request by email to drphil-legal@drphil.com or write to us at
Peteski Productions, Inc., Attn: Legal, 2450 Colorado Avenue, Suite #500E, Santa Monica, CA 90404-3443. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides consumers who are residents of the State of California with specific rights related to their personal information, subject to certain exceptions.  It also requires us to disclose the information we collect, the purposes for which we collect it, and what we share and disclose.
The Personal Information We Collect and Why
You have the right to know what personal information we collect and why. The information we collect and the purposes for which we use it are described in this Privacy Policy
The Personal Information We Share or Disclose
You have the right to know what personal information we disclose or share with third parties.  The personal information we share is described in this Privacy Policy
Right to Know
You have the right to ask us what personal information we have collected from you over the past 12 months.  You may make such requests up to twice a year.
Right to Delete
You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information.  In certain circumstances the law may not require or permit us to delete certain personal information, but if we cannot honor a deletion request, we will tell you.
Right to Opt-Out (“Do Not Sell”)
You have the right to tell us not to disclose or transfer your personal information to a third party in exchange for something of value.  The CCPA refers to this as your right to say “Do Not Sell” my personal information.  If you opt out of disclosure or transfer of your personal information, you may later opt-in again to having your personal information move more freely.
13-15 Year Olds
We automatically opt-out consumers whom we actually know are at least 13 and less than 16 years old.  In the language of the CCPA, we “do not sell” their personal information unless they opt-in.
Exercising Your Rights
Right to Know and Right to Delete
You may ask us for the personal information we have about you, or ask us to delete your personal information, by emailing us at privacy@drphil.com or by calling 800.549.7529.  When you make a request online, we will verify your identity by sending you an email and asking you to respond. When you call the toll-free number, you must leave a name and address or email address we can use to contact you.
If you ask what personal information we have received from you, and we cannot verify your identity, or if providing the information you have requested creates a security risk, we will give you a general description of the type of personal information we have about you.
If you ask us to delete your personal information, and we can’t verify your identity and confirm that you made the request, we will not be able to honor it.  Generally, though, if we can confirm your identity and your request, we will delete, de-identify, or aggregate your personal information so it can no longer be associated with you.  There are some reasons that the law may require or permit us to keep your personal information, however.
Opt-Out (Do Not Sell)
If you do not want us to disclose or transfer your personal information to a third party in exchange for something valuable, you may opt out by visiting privacy@drphil.com or calling 800.549.7529. When you call our toll free number, you will need to leave a name and address or email address that we can use to contact you.
Authorized Agents
If you are an authorized agent, you must make your request by emailing us at privacy@drphil.com
and put the words “CCPA Requests, Authorized Agents” in the subject field. You also need to attach to your email proof that you are registered with the Attorney General, as required by law, and proof you have written authority to act for the consumer.  You shall also provide the email address of the consumer you are representing so we can verify their identity, or provide documentation that you have power of attorney for the consumer pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000-4465.  We will not be able to honor requests without sufficient documentation that you are authorized to represent the consumer.
Requests made on behalf of a “Household”
If you would like to request personal information about your household, you may make your request by emailing us at privacy@drphil.com and putting the words "CCPA Household Request” in the subject field of the email. We will need to verify the members of the household, and in some cases, if a request raises security concerns for any household member, we may not be able to honor the request.
Financial Incentives
We do not offer any financial incentives for consumers to take any action or make any choices in using our services.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights described in this Privacy Policy. Specifically, we will not deny you goods or services or charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits, or by imposing penalties.
California “Shine the Light” Law
Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed certain information during the preceding year for those third parties' direct marketing purposes.
California “Eraser” Law
If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a user of the website where this policy is posted, you may request removal of content or information you have publicly posted. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete removal from the Internet of the content or information you posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal.
Exercising these Rights
For all requests under the “Shine the Light” or “Eraser” Law, you must put the words "Your California Privacy Rights Shine the Light/Eraser Law" in the subject field of an email to privacy@drphil.com, and include the name of the CBS Branded Service for which you are requesting the information. You must also include your full name, street address, city, state, and zip code.

We may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.
Information You Provide Us
A. We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information

Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one.
