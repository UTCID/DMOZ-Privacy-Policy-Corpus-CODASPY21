PRIVACY POLICY
Your privacy is important to us. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used at our site.
The Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you – such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, etc. – unless you choose to fill out a “Contact Us” form, found on many of the pages of the site or to email us directly.
We do automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our site – such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
How We Normally Use Information About You
We use non-personally identifiable information to analyze site usage (such as aggregated information on the pages visited by our users), which allows us to improve the design and content of our site.
In the ordinary course, we use personally identifiable information you provide solely to respond to your inquiry.
We will not contact you about other matters, unless you specifically request it, nor will we share, rent, or sell your personally identifiable information outside Habush Habush & Rottier S.C. ®. If you are interested in applying for a job at Habush Habush & Rottier S.C. ®, and choose to submit resume information by email, we will use it only for the internal application review process. We will not voluntarily share, rent or sell it outside Habush Habush & Rottier S.C. ®.
However, it is possible, though unlikely, that we might be forced to disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request.
Also, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you transmit over the web or that may be collectable in transit by others, including contractors who provide services to us.
