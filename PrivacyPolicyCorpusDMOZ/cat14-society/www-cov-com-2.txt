Legal Notices
The purpose of this website is to provide information about our qualifications and experience. The information provided on this site does not, and is not intended to, constitute legal advice. Any prior results described on this website do not guarantee a similar outcome. The jurisdictions in which our lawyers are licensed to practice are indicated within each lawyer’s biography in the “Biographies” section of this website. Readers of this website should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained on this website without first consulting legal counsel. Covington & Burling LLP is pleased to provide the information on this website as a service to our clients and to the general public. We hope that you will find the information informative and useful, and we would be delighted to speak with you to answer any questions you may have about our firm. Please feel free to e-mail us with your thoughts about our website or to request more information about our firm. Although we hope that you will find the material on this website informative, the material and links to third-party websites that may be included on the Covington & Burling LLP website (www.cov.com) are provided for informational purposes only. We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided on this website or any third-party website which may be accessed by a link from this website, including any representations or warranties as to accuracy, timeliness or completeness. All material on this website, unless otherwise marked, is copyrighted by Covington & Burling LLP. We ask our visitors to respect the intellectual property rights of all copyright holders available on our website. Individuals are granted limited license to retrieve or print a copy from files on this website for personal, non-commercial use only. Inclusion of any part of this website in another work, whether printed, electronic or other form is prohibited. Covington & Burling LLP's operation of this website is not intended to create, and will not create, an attorney-client relationship with you. While we are happy to hear from you by telephone, mail, e-mail, or facsimile transmission, contacting us does not create a attorney-client relationship between you and the firm. Please recognize that we cannot undertake a representation until, among other things, we are assured that doing so will not involve a conflict of interest. We therefore ask you not to send us any confidential information or information about any legal matter that may involve you without first contacting one of our lawyers and receiving a written statement from us whereby we agree to represent or advise you. Please note that any information you convey to Covington & Burling LLP over the Internet may not be secure, and that information conveyed prior to establishing an attorney-client relationship may not be privileged or confidential. To inquire about legal representation by Covington & Burling LLP, you may write, email or call the Covington & Burling LLP contact person specializing in your area of interest. Alternatively, you may contact Covington's webmaster. The person you contact will take you through our conflict of interest and client acceptance procedures and, if your matter clears those procedures, will put you in touch with the lawyer best suited to handle your matter. Once you receive an engagement letter from us, you will be our client.
