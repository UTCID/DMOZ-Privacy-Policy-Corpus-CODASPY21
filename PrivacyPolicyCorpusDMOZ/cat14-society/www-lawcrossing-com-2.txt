Practice Areas
At LawCrossing we combine extensive research and legal expertise to categorize each job into a practice area. Whenever possible, we use the most commonly used practice area designation for each job type, trying our best to provide the most intuitive categorization. For difficult-to-categorize jobs, we consider use of keywords, the targeted applicant, and the importance of getting a candidate with specialization. When a job is truly unique, novel, or in a practice area that is so small that it does not warrant a separate section, we place the job in the "Other" category. If we note an increase in the number of jobs with a common practice area that have already been categorized as "Other," we create a new practice area section. The practice area descriptions and key words are being updated daily to provide you with the best, most accurate search possible.

Experience Range
Many of the jobs we post specify ranges of experience that the employers would accept, so we allow our users to search jobs in a range of experience for which they would like to be considered. Indicating that you would like to look at jobs within a certain range will include all jobs that specify a range that overlaps with the range you have included (e.g. if you entered a range of 3-5, jobs requesting 4-6 years of experience will be included). If you would like to only be considered for the specific number of years of experience you have, enter that number in both the minimum and maximum fields and only jobs that ask for an experience range that include your level will be included in your search results. To view all jobs, use the default range of 1 to More than 20.
