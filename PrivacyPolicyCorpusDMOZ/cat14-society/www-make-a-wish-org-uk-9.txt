Wish Applicant privacy policy
Make-A-Wish Foundation® UK is committed to protecting your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and store your information while we are granting your child’s wish.If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not submit any personal information to us.
Should you decide not to consent, please be aware this will affect our ability to proceed with granting your child’s wish and therefore please contact us as soon as possible to discuss this further.The processing of your information is carried out by Make-A-Wish Foundation® UK, a registered charity in England & Wales (295672) and Scotland (SC037479). Some useful definitions:What is Personal data?Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.What identifies an individual could be as simple as a name, address, email address or a number or could include other identifiers such as an IP address or a cookie identifier, or other factors.If it is possible to identify an individual directly from the information you are processing, then that information may be personal data.What is Special data?Special category data is personal data that is more sensitive, and so needs more protection.In order to lawfully process special category data, you must identify both a lawful basis under Article 6 and a separate condition for processing special category data under Article 9.This is because special category data is more sensitive, and so needs more protection. For example, information about an individual’s;race;ethnic origin;politics;religion;trade union membership;genetics;biometrics (where used for ID purposes);health;sex life; orsexual orientation.In particular, this type of data could create more significant risks to a person’s fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, by putting them at risk of unlawful discrimination.Does this Policy apply to you?This Policy applies specifically to parents or legal guardians who are making enquiries, or referring, their child for a wish (referred to as the “wish child”). This Policy also applies to the wish children themselves. This Policy applies to any personal and/or special category data you provide us, including information about yourself, the wish child, and any other family members. Please note that wish applications cannot progress without the involvement and explicit consent of the parents or guardians of the wish child. In the remainder of this Policy, any reference to “you” and “your” means the parent or guardian of a wish child or the wish child themselves.Why we use your informationWe will only use your information where we have lawful and legal basis to do so and will always respect the data protection and human rights under all existing UK and EU data protection legislation and the Human Rights Act 1998.Where we do rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interest under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to process your information, we will always ensure that this is done in a way that is not intrusive or does not cause distress. We may also use your information because we have a legal obligation to do so or because we need to fulfil a contractual obligation.
Some examples of what we mean by this include:processing and responding to applications, queries or requestsfulfilling wishes on behalf of the wish child and liaising with medical professionals and/or carers in respect of such activities,gathering information as part of investigations by regulatory bodies or in connection with legal proceedings or requests,ensuring business policies are adhered to,statistical analysis and research, orto notify you of changes to our services.Other reasons include:To pursue our charitable purpose to deliver our mission and visionTo raise vital funds for our work, for example, through our online Sponsor-A-Wish programme (further explicit consent would be obtained from you in such instances)To ensure we meet our regulatory requirements as a charityTo manage our ongoing relationship with our supporters and anyone we work withTo manage our financial transactions and prevent fraudHow we use your informationTo assess if the wish child is eligible for a wishWe have medical criteria that the wish child must fall within for us to be able to grant their wish. To establish this eligibility, we will use the medical information provided by you and your medical consultant/s.
Your primary medical consultant / professional may also ask us to seek further advice from other medical professionals. In such cases, we will seek explicit consent from you to do so, prior to actioning.To grant the wish child’s wishThe process of granting a wish requires obtaining, assessing and storing information regarding the wish child and other relevant family members. In addition to collecting information from enquiry forms and application forms, we may also collect personal information during visits or other meetings with you, or via telephone conversations or emails.To respond to any enquiries, requests, queries or complaints you make to usThis may include responding to your query or feedback, or sending you relevant information or materials.
We may also keep a record of conversations we have with you, feedback you provide and any materials we send out to you.To comply with the lawAs with all charities, we ensure that our activities comply with the law. Therefore, we may need to share or use your personal information if we are required to do so by law (for example, in response to a warrant or court order), and we may use information from other sources for the purposes of fraud prevention, for example to comply with money laundering regulations, or to protect people’s rights, property or safety.To share wish stories as part of our charitable activitiesWhere we gain consent to do so, we may photograph and film wishes to share the stories of wish children and their families to encourage charitable activities.

To find out more about this, or to change your consent for us to use images, please contact marketing@makeawish.org.uk.There is no obligation or assumption at this time that your consent must be given with regard to the above statement, in order to qualify for a wish.VolunteersThe Make-A-Wish community includes a network of Volunteers that help us raise funds and assist with the wish journey.In order for our Volunteers to perform their role for Make-A-Wish, we will share your personal and/or special category data with them. Volunteers will only receive relevant information necessary to fulfil their role.For example, our Wish Visitors, who, with your agreement, will visit your home to understand the wish child’s One-True-Wish, will require your name, address and telephone number to arrange the wish visit. Subject to you having provided your explicit consent during the wish application process, the Wish Visitors will also require the condition/health information of the wish child so that, in cooperation with yourself and the wish child’s medical professionals, we ensure that medical requirements such as carer attendance or oxygen needs are fulfilled on the wish.
