Thank
you for visiting the Pinellas County website
and reviewing our privacy and security policy. We will collect
no personal information about you when you
visit our website unless you choose to provide
that information to us.
Here
is how we handle information about your visit to
our website:
Information collected and stored automatically
If all you do during your visit is browse through
the website, read pages, or download information,
we will gather and store certain information
about your visit automatically. This information
does not identify you personally. Only the
following information is automatically collected
and stored about your visit:
The
Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if
you use a private Internet access account,
or
"yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's
domain) and IP address (an IP address is
a number that is automatically assigned to
your computer whenever you are surfing the
Web) from which you access our website;
The
type of browser and operating system
used to access our site;
The
date and time you access our site;
The
pages you visit; and
If
you linked to our website from another
website, the address of that website.
We
use this information to help us make the site more
useful to visitors -- to learn about the number
of visitors to our site and the types of technology
our visitors use. We do not track or record information
about individuals and their visits.
If
you send us personal information
If you choose to provide us with personal information
-- by filling out a form with your personal information
and submitting it to us through the website -- we
use that information to respond to your message and
to help us get you the information you have requested.
We only share the information you give us with another
government agency if your inquiry relates to that
agency, or as otherwise required by law. Pinellas
County does not collect information for commercial
marketing.
Public
Disclosure
As a general rule, the County does not disclose any
personally identifiable information collected online
except where you have given us permission, or where
the information is requested to be disclosed and
is public information under the State of Florida
statutes or other applicable laws. Visitors to the
site should be aware that Florida
Statute 119 declares that it is the policy of
this state that all state, county, and municipal
records shall be open for personal inspection by
any person, and thus information collected by the
County resulting from the use of its websites may
be subject to examination and inspection upon request,
if such information is a public record and not otherwise
protected from disclosure by statute.
Choice
You may
decline participation in any activity that
asks for information (i.e., surveys or emails).
Your choice to not participate will have no
effect on your ability to access information
on the County's web sites.
Cookies
To better serve you, we occasionally use "cookies" to
customize your browsing experience. Cookies are simple
text files stored by your web browser and they provide
a method of distinguishing among visitors to the
web sites. Cookies created on your computer by using
our web sites do not contain personally identifiable
information and do not compromise your privacy or
security. We use the cookie feature to store a randomly
generated identifying tag on your computer.
Your
acceptance of the cookie will serve to provide you
with additional functionality in choosing the information
you wish to view on a regular basis.
Passwords
In certain instances, you will have the opportunity
to receive or create a password to access or submit
personal information. You should not divulge your
password to anyone and the County will never ask
you for your password in an unsolicited phone call
or e-mail. When you are finished with those applications
that are password protected, you should exit the
page.
Site
security
For site security purposes and to ensure that
this service remains available to all users, this
government computer system employs commercial software
programs to monitor network traffic to identify
unauthorized attempts to upload or change information,
or otherwise cause damage.
Except
for authorized law enforcement investigations,
no other attempts are made to identify individual
users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are
used for no other purposes and are scheduled for
regular destruction in accordance with State guidelines
for records management and retention.
Unauthorized
attempts to upload information or change information
on this service are strictly prohibited and may
be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure
Protection Act.

agencies. In some cases we link to private organizations.
