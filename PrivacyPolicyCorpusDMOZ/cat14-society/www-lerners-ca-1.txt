Protecting your business, protecting yourself.
Privacy and data protection are fundamental components of a solid business strategy, and are critical requirements for any organization that deals with clients or the public, not only from a legal perspective, but a reputational one. With the rise of more and more sophisticated social engineering fraud schemes and the evolution of technology, protecting yourself and your clients is of paramount importance. However, navigating the complex legislation and the myriad potential pitfalls can be daunting. Let the Lerners Privacy Group be your guide.
Navigating the Legislative Landscape
We advise clients on their responsibilities and potential liabilities related to privacy legislation including the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, (MFIPPA), and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Our advice includes: the collection and use of personal information, freedom of information requests, addressing privacy breaches and complaints and implementing policies and best practices. We also provide advice related to data protection regulatory regimes, responding to regulatory investigations, audits, compliance and contract reviews and dispute resolution.
Being Prepared is Your Best Defence to Manage Risk
We assist with compliance by drafting customized privacy and anti-spam policies. We conduct assessments on new projects, software and initiatives to identify and manage privacy risks. Recommendations are made to protect your organization’s and your client’s privacy interests. We represent clients in dealings with government agencies such as the Ontario Privacy Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, in proceedings under access to information laws, and by responding to privacy inquiries or complaints. We provide advisory services that can assist you in avoiding the need for crisis intervention. Should your organization require it, we can help you navigate the resulting issues from a breach or loss of information.
No Matter the Industry, Information is an Asset worth Protecting
Our clients include health care facilities, clinics, public health units and regulatory bodies, regulated professionals, professional corporations, municipalities, insurance companies, post-secondary and other educational institutions, financial institutions, public and private organizations.
The knowledge and expertise of our lawyers advising on privacy matters is further supported by our experience and reputation as fearless litigators and seasoned business advisors, as well as our approach to developing strategic solutions for clients that place a priority on advancing their interests and getting results.
Early investigation can pave the road to recovery, or secure a strong defence
When a cyber incident occurs, the damage caused may be the result of a contract breach or negligence of a third party. Early investigation and consideration of potential subrogated claim can assist in building a strong case leading to a greater chance of successful recovery. Similarly, when faced with a claim for breach of privacy or failure to maintain cyber security standards, experienced counsel is key. When faced with privacy and cyber litigation, our team has the necessary expertise to advance or defend our client’s interests.

Forewarned is Forearmed
Privacy laws, regulations and best practices constantly evolve and adapt to changes in technology and society. Businesses and consumers struggle to stay abreast of these developments to ensure they are compliant and are able to protect themselves. We keep our clients up-to-date on changes to the law and their legal obligations as commercial enterprises through regular updates on the law, technology, and best practices.
