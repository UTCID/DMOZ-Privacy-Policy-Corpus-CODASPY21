Created on 21 September 2011
Recent outbreaks in food-borne illness in both Europe and the U.S. –
such as the E.coli episode this summer in Germany (that affected some
transatlantic travellers) and the U.S. scare and recall involving
salmonella-infected ground turkey meat – have underscored the need for
better protection and inspection of foodstuffs and other agricultural
products.
But efforts to tackle the issue are encountering problems on both
sides of the Atlantic. In particular, funding problems have beset
Congressional-mandated reforms in the U.S.

Europe Must Be Able to Track and Control Clone Products

Category: EA October 2010
Created on 29 September 2010
A
number of recent articles in the European and American press have
highlighted the grave concern in Europe about reports of imports and
sales, without licensing or labeling, of meat and milk derived from
clones. Whereas approval and labeling is necessary for the sale of the
meat of clones, the European Commission has taken a very lax view on
milk and meat from the offspring of clones. Several European countries
are already importing clone semen and embryos. Switzerland has
acknowledged that clone-derived products are sold there (that can be
exported to the EU) and the British have discovered in their newspapers
that they may be unknowingly eating clone-derived meat and milk. There
is currently no system for tracing the origin of these products,
informing consumers of the nature of what they are buying or indeed
tracking clone offspring as they mix into the gene pool.

Created on 29 April 2009
While the EU and the new U.S. Administration are trying to harmonize their views, trade in food and regulations regarding biotechnology remain among the most delicate areas in transatlantic trade negotiations, in part because of the different backgrounds on which public opinions are based. Dan Rotenberg, Counselor for Agricultural Affairs at the Delegation of the European Commission addressed  the status of the Doha Trade Talks in this sector. His colleague at the Delegation, Dr. Wolf-Martin Maier, Counselor for Food Safety, Health and Consumer Affairs addressed questions regarding food safety and consumer protection regulations.
