Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
Children's Information May be Received and Retained with Consent, but No Third Party Sharing
The Internet, as a widespread and often readily available resource, presents a host of possibilities and challenges for young users. We understand this, and are committed to providing an online experience for children that is safe and rewarding. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we strive to safeguard the privacy of children who visit our website. Personal information is defined under COPPA as "individually identifiable information," information that helps others to identify a particular person. The following is information about data we may collect, how we use it, who has access to it, and what parents' and legal guardians' rights are with regard to the collection, storage, and use of their child's personal information.
Visitors to our website under age 13 are for the most part free to access the various features our site offers without disclosing any personal information. From time to time, however, we offer interactive programs and activities that may require children to disclose personal information in order to participate. We may also request personal information for demographic interests and research to help us provide for our parents and children. Children will not be required to disclose any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a program or activity. The information required may include the child's name, e-mail address, age, mailing address, along with other personal data.
Before children under age 13 will be permitted to disclose personal information to participate in any programs or activities, we require consent from a parent or legal guardian. In order to do this, we will ask the child to provide his or her first and last name and e-mail address, as well as the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian. With this information, we will e-mail the parent or legal guardian and request consent for the collection and use of the child's personal information. Parents or legal guardians may give their consent by completing a consent form and returning it by mail or facsimile. Parents or legal guardians may also choose to give consent simply by e-mailing us directly. If parents or legal guardians choose this option, we will verify their e-mailed consent by follow-up letter, telephone call or e-mail. Once consent is given, the child will be permitted to participate.
Parents or legal guardians who provide consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information may revoke that consent at any time. They may also review and edit their child's information and request that information be deleted at any time. Parents or legal guardians who have any other questions or concerns about our privacy policy, who wish to revoke consent to the collection and use of their child's information and stop all future collection of that information, or who wish to review and/or delete their child's information may contact our Webmaster by e-mail at webmaster@vop.com, by telephone at (970) 622-2999 or by mail at Box 999, Loveland, CO 80539-099. Parents or legal guardians must also verify their identity and relationship to the child by providing their name, address, and stated legal relationship to the child.
