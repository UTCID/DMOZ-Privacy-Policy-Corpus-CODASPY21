Getting Ahead
The Food Bank of Northern Nevada goes beyond distributing food in our efforts to help struggling families in our region get ahead in hard times.
Home > Get Help > Getting Ahead
Getting Ahead is part of our Bridges to a Thriving Nevada initiative and involves a sixteen week course for people living in poverty that helps to uncover the resources necessary for their families.
The Food Bank of Northern Nevada is excited to be collaborating with Opportunity Alliance of Nevada who are now conducting Getting Ahead Classes.  Find more information about Getting Ahead by clicking here.
