Kevin Henrichson Represents Victims of Serious Accidents.Kevin Henrichson is proud to be named among the 10 Best Personal Injury Lawyers in Client Satisfaction in 2019 by the American Institute of Personal Injury Attorneys.  He has also been named a “Super Lawyer” in the area of personal injury by Texas Monthly magazine every year from 2017-2019.  Candidates for Super Lawyers’ recognition are evaluated on twelve indicators of Professional Achievement and Peer Recognition, and only 5% of attorneys in Texas are selected.  He was also recognized as a “Rising Star” in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013 and 2014, a distinction which only 2.5% of attorneys in Texas earn.  Super Lawyers and Rising Stars are chosen by Thomson Reuters.Henrichson’s success in the courtroom has led to his invitation for acceptance into the prestigious, American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA).  Lawyers must be invited for admittance into ABOTA and meet rigorous requirements of trial experience, ability, civility and professionalism.Kevin Henrichson grew up knowing that he wanted to follow in the family tradition of serving the public as an attorney. His father, Preston Henrichson practices law in the same building that his grandfather, EG Henrichson practiced for more than 40 years.“I was enamored with my father’s career because it seemed like he was always doing something important,” Henrichson recalls. “I just thought that was inspiring to watch.”Henrichson learned at a very young age that good lawyers do more for their clients than just provide legal advice.“I remember when I was a kid, on my dad’s building it said, ‘Attorneys and counselors,’” Henrichson said. “I really didn’t understand that then, but I’ve learned that there really is a counselor element to the practice of law for my clients. Many times, they need to have someone to hold their hand through the process. There is so much anxiety if they are out of work and have financial stress. So there’s a lot of counsel that goes into being a good plaintiff’s lawyer, not just legal counsel.”In 1997, after obtaining an undergraduate degree in finance from Texas A&M, Henrichson went straight to St. Mary’s University School of Law. He wrote for the St. Mary’s Law Journal and won first place in the school’s mock trial competition. During law school, he interned for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Henrichson graduated at the top of his class in 2001.Trial Experience and Notable CasesWith his strong academic performance, Henrichson had a range of employment options after getting his J.D., and he knew he wanted to get trial experience as soon as possible. He came to Austin and joined a solo practitioner who let him do just that—in his first year practicing law, Henrichson tried five jury trials by himself and won them all.A year later, he joined Byrd Davis Alden & Henrichson, LLP and has been focusing his practice on serious personal injury litigation ever since. He has handled many noteworthy cases. For example:He obtained the second largest jury verdict ($8.2 Million) in Texas for a motor vehicle accident in 2011. This reflects the jury’s verdict at trial and not the amount actually recovered by the client. The case was settled after trial for a confidential amount.He received the first jury verdict in Williamson County for civil damages for aiding in the concealment of an abducted child.He recently obtained a settlement ($883,942 to client after attorney’s fees and case expenses) on behalf of a bicyclist who seriously injured when struck by a car. Liability was disputed and advanced accident reconstruction was used to prove the case.Success From Tireless PreparationTo Henrichson, the most important key to success as a trial lawyer is tireless preparation.“Before you go to trial, there’s nothing fun about it,” he says. “You’re working all day and all night for weeks in order to be prepared. Once you walk into the courtroom, you have pre-planned every step of the trial. And then it’s fun. It’s really, really fun to be able to try a case after you’ve prepared for so long and worked so hard.”Outdoor Activities and Family TimeHenrichson says that nothing in life is quite like trying a difficult case in court. But he also enjoys outdoors activities—boating, hiking, fishing—and family time, which includes raising a young daughter with his wife, Kate Henrichson.Henrichson is a Barrister in the Robert W. Calvert Inn of Court and a member of the State Bar of Texas, the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, the Capital Area Trial Lawyers Association, and the Austin Bar Association.He is admitted to practice law by the State Bar of Texas, and the United States District Courts for the Western and Southern Districts of Texas.

Client Testimonials
Tommy
“I am so pleased with the manner in which my case was handled. Kevin Henrichson spent many hours working on my behalf and I am truly grateful to him.”
Lina H.
“My son, Joey was in an accident and seriously injured. Kevin helped us achieve a fair recovery for Joey for his needs. Kevin is not only a great lawyer, he is a good person. He was willing to do what was in the best interest for my son and our family. We are very grateful for all his help and we highly recommend him.”
Mark
“Last November my family and I were involved in a tragic car accident that was caused by another driver. Kevin Henrichson came highly recommended and I am thankful to have had his expertise throughout the ordeal. His professionalism and determination to make sure we were not unduly burdened financially made all the difference. There is no way we could ever be compensated for the loss of life and the injuries sustained, however he explained the legalese to us and helped us navigate the complex insurance situation with compassion. Kevin and his staff were always available and responded to our concerns in a timely manner every step of the way. I am grateful for his kindness during such a difficult time. I will absolutely recommend him in the future.”
Janice
“Kevin has been an excellent attorney for me and for those I’ve referred to him. He’s professional, compassionate, ethical, and kind.”
Sharon
“Kevin Henrichson was a great person to work with. He was very fair, understanding, did a lot of research on the car accident, and was professional. Thanks so much.”
Tony
“I would highly recommend working with Kevin Hendrichson at Byrd Davis Alden & Henrichson, LLP. In the blink of an eye, a drunk driver caused death and destruction in my life. Kevin was referred to me by two different professional references and as soon as I was able I signed Kevin on to be my legal advocate. Having a professional take on all of the legal and insurance challenges allowed me to focus on the healing my body required and was worth the cost. Kevin himself was compassionate with me but determined and tenacious with any obstacles that came between me and my settlement. We were successful and Kevin is responsible for it. I now have as much closure as I can ever expect from such a terrible experience. Thank You.”
Sharon
