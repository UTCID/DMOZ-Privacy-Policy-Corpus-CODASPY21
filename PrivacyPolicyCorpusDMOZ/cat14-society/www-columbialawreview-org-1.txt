Share on TwitterShare on FacebookWHEN CONGRESS MAKES NO POLICY CHOICE: THE CASE OF FTC DATA SECURITY ENFORCEMENT
For twenty-five years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has brought enforcement actions against companies for data breaches using its statutory authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to police “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” While the Commission originally brought cases under the “deceptive” prong of Section 5, more recent cases have been brought under the vague “unfairness” prong. These cases allege that a company that has experienced a data breach engaged in “unfair” acts or practices by failing to adopt “reasonable” data security measures. All but one of the cases were settled outside of court through consent decrees or the FTC dropping the case. In 2018, the Eleventh Circuit found the FTC overstepped its authority in the one case that did not settle, LabMD, Inc. v. FTC. The decision called into question the FTC’s data security enforce­ment practices and, specifically, its use of a vague “reasonable­ness” standard in its consent decrees. Now, the FTC has rethought its approach to data security enforcement and asked Congress to clarify the FTC’s authority.
This Comment argues that the FTC has failed to provide fair notice to regulated parties about what data security practices businesses must engage in to avoid enforcement actions. Further, the Comment argues that Congress must make a policy choice in the data security space and specify a private standard that the FTC must use to evaluate data security practices. If not, regulated parties should begin commenting on complaints, orders, and consent decrees to induce the Commission to further clarify what “reasonable,” and therefore “fair,” data security practices entail.

Introduction
Since 1995, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has used its jurisdiction to police “unfair or deceptive acts or practices”

However, the FTC’s authority in the data security enforcement context came under scrutiny in LabMD, Inc. v. FTC, a 2018 Eleventh Circuit decision that invalidated the FTC’s attempted enforcement action against LabMD, a medical laboratory that suffered a data breach exposing patient records.

Finding that the FTC’s proposed consent order “commanded LabMD to overhaul and replace its data-security program to meet an inde­terminable standard of reasonableness,” the court held that the FTC could not enforce its order.

For the FTC, LabMD represented a significant defeat. Prior to the decision, the FTC used its authority under the “unfairness” prong of Federal Trade Commission Act Section 5 to bring cases against companies for failing to adopt what the Commission considers “reasonable” data security measures without any additional specificity.

Therefore, the LabMD decision called into question the FTC’s entire data security enforcement practice. In December 2018, the agency held a rare public hearing on the topic.

However, the Commission has still provided little guidance on what data security practices constitute an “unfair” practice within the ambit of the FTC’s statutory enforcement authority to remedy, and still continues to use the vague “reasonableness” standard in its complaints when bringing enforcement actions.

Congress could fix this problem by specifying the FTC’s data security enforcement authority, but so far it has failed to do so. And there is little hope for reform in the near future. Following California’s passage of a data privacy law in 2018 (the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)) and the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, the current focus in Congress is on data privacy—“user[] . . . control over how businesses collect, use, and share their information”—and not data security—“prevent[ing] unauthorized parties from accessing, altering, or rendering unavailable [consumers’] data.”

As a result, regulated parties—really any business operating online or using electronic records—are likely to continue to face the risk of FTC data security enforcement actions without clarified standards. Congress has failed “to make the ‘important policy choices’’’

The fact that the FTC derives much of its statutory authority to regulate data security from Section 5’s “unfairness” prong is particularly concerning given that multiple Supreme Court Justices now support a revival of the nondelegation doctrine. See Damon Root, Kavanaugh Joins Gorsuch in Fight to Revive Nondelegation Doctrine, Reason (Nov. 25, 2019), https://reason.com/2019/11/25/kavanaugh-joins-gorsuch-in-fight-to-revive-nondelegation-doctrine/?amp [https://perma.cc/EL7M-923R]. While this Comment takes no position on whether the FTC’s data security enforcement is a nondelegation issue, data security is an area in which there is little dispute that regulation is needed, Congress has failed to adequately define authority to regulate, and an administrative agency has taken over the regulation using vague statutory authority and standards. Data security is a field in which Congress has provided no policy choice, and as a result regulated parties are forced to contend with an administrative enforcement system that fails to provide adequate notice of the regulatory requirements to businesses. See infra Part II.

with respect to data security regulation and has left regulated parties to contend with ad hoc FTC enforcement guided by both vague statutory authority (“unfairness”) and vague standards (“reasonableness”).
This Comment argues that regulated parties lack adequate notice of what the FTC considers “unfair” data security practices given the realities of the FTC’s current enforcement mechanisms, and that Congress should provide clearer data security standards as part of a larger privacy bill. Absent congressional action, regulated parties should begin commenting on the FTC’s complaints, orders, and consent decrees to force the Commission’s data security staff to clarify what data security practices companies must adopt to avoid FTC enforcement actions. Part I discusses the FTC’s current data security enforce­ment practices, the LabMD decision that called them into question, and the Commission’s reaction to LabMD. Part II identifies the problem with the current approach and argues that the changes the FTC has made post-LabMD fail to sufficiently clarify what the FTC considers “reasonable” data security practices. Part III provides two potential solutions, one involving congressional action and one involving congressional inaction, to provide regulated parties notice of what “reasonable” data security means.

The FTC has brought seventy cases alleging inadequate data security practices since 1995.

the FTC has two methods for bringing an enforcement action against the company responsible for the data’s safekeeping, and two statutory provisions under which it can bring the action.
First, the FTC can choose whether to bring an enforcement action in an administrative proceeding or in federal court.
18

Solove & Hartzog, Common Law of Privacy, supra note 2, at 609.

In the data security context, the FTC rarely brings cases in court and instead uses administrative adjudication to force defendants into consent decrees.

...
Close
Second, and more relevant to the data security context, is what prong the FTC brings the action under. When the Commission decides to initiate an enforcement action, the FTC chooses whether to bring the enforce­ment action under the “deceptive” or “unfairness” prongs of Section 5 of the FTC Act.
20
20
See id. at 674–75.
...
Close
If the Commission brings the enforcement action under the “deceptive” prong, the FTC looks at the statements a business that experi­ences a data breach has made to consumers about privacy protection, and alleges the business violated the privacy standards it promised to consum­ers (and, therefore, “deceived” them).
21
21
Id. at 674.
...
Close
For the “deceptive” prong to be violated, the FTC has said in its Policy Statement on Deception that the alleged deception must be “material” to consumers, meaning “con­sumers are likely to have chosen differently but for the deception.”

...
Close
If the FTC brings an enforcement action under the “unfairness” prong, the Commission alleges that the business engaged in an unfair trade practice that allowed it to gain an advantage over competitors by not offering “reasonable” data security to consumers.
23

See Geoffrey A. Manne & Kristian Stout, When “Reasonable” Isn’t: The FTC’s Standardless Data Security Standard, 15 J.L.

In 2019 and after the LabMD decision, the FTC began eliminating the word “reasonableness” from its consent decrees. Milch & Bieler, supra note 10.

Close
While the early data security enforcement actions were brought under the “deceptive” prong, recent controversial cases like LabMD have been brought under the “unfairness” prong, which suggests a desire on the part of the FTC to expand its enforcement power in the data security area.

24
See LabMD, Inc. v. FTC, 894 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir. 2018); Stegmaier & Bartnick, supra note 19, at 674–75 & nn.11–12.
...
Close
This tracks with the change from the early period of the FTC’s data security enforcement when the FTC “encouraged self-regulation” during which “the companies themselves . . . create[d] their own rules, and the FTC . . . enforce[d] them” using the “deceptive” prong of Section 5.

In recent years, the FTC has been using the “unfairness” prong of Section 5 to bring cases against companies for failing to adopt what the Commission considers “reasonable” data security measures.

This “reasonableness” standard requires a company to adopt “data security measures . . .

But, what are “reasonable” data security measures? As is discussed next, the LabMD case shows that the FTC did not make this clear.

Concerned that the FTC’s “cease and desist order . . .” does not instruct LabMD “to stop committing a specific act or practice” and instead “commands LabMD to overhaul and replace its data-security program to meet an indeterminable standard of reasonableness,” the Eleventh Circuit found the FTC’s order “unenforceable.”

The decision was perceived as having a significant impact on the FTC’s data security enforcement practice. Prior to LabMD, the FTC had “brought more than 60 cases related to data security.

Many of these cases were brought under the vague “reasonable­ness” standard the Eleventh Circuit found so problematic in LabMD. The next section discusses the FTC’s reaction to the decision.
C. FTC Data Security Enforcement Post-LabMD
LabMD brought attention to many of the problems with the FTC’s data security enforcement practices, and the Commission recognized this fact. After LabMD, the Commission scheduled a public hearing “to examine the FTC’s authority to deter unfair and deceptive conduct in data security . . . matters.”

Following the hearing, the FTC engaged in a public campaign to lobby Congress to provide the agency more authority over data security (and privacy) issues. The FTC has argued that the United States lags behind other western countries in its approach to data security. In an April 2019 congressional hearing, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said that while the FTC only has forty employees dedicated to data security enforcement, the United Kingdom has 500.

As a result, the Commission has asked Congress to provide additional funding for data security (and privacy) enforcement staff, which the Commission hopes will provide funding for at least 160 new staffers who can help the Commission bring more cases.

In a blog post, the Commission notes that the orders “continue to require that the company implement a comprehensive, process-based data security program, and [now] they require the company to implement specific safeguards to address the problems alleged in the complaint” such as “yearly employee training, access controls, monitoring systems for data security incidents, patch management systems, and encryp­tion.”

This begs the question to which this Comment turns to next: Do regulated parties have notice about what the FTC considers “unreasonable,” and therefore “unfair,” data security practices that are within the Commission’s statutory authority to regulate?
II. Regulated Parties Lack Notice of What Constitutes “Unfair” Data Security Practices
Assuming the FTC has statutory authority to regulate data security under the “unfairness” prong and can make data security policy by adjudica­tion, the Commission still must provide “fair notice” of what constitutes “reasonable,” and therefore “fair,” data security practices.
51
51
See Stegmaier & Bartnick, supra note 19, at 689.
...
Close
Even when looked at in the most positive light, the FTC has not provided fair notice to regulated parties about what data security measures the Commission considers appropriate. This is a result of (1) the lack of bright-line rules for when a party can be said to have engaged in “unreasonable,” and there­fore “unfair,” data security practices and (2) the lack of information in the adjudicatory documents on the FTC’s website. Each of these will be discussed in turn.
A. Balancing Test Invites Arbitrary Enforcement
The FTC does not use bright-line rules in the data security context. In other words, there are no per se unreasonable data security practices. The Commission emphasizes that “it does not require perfect security” and “the mere fact that a breach occurred does not mean that a company has violated the law.”
52
52
See 50th Settlement Statement, supra note 6, at 1.
...
Close
Instead, the Commission will use a balancing test to determine whether to bring an action when a breach does occur. Before filing a complaint, the FTC will balance the costs and benefits of security measures that would have prevented the breach to determine whether the company behaved unreasonably by failing to adopt those measures, making the company’s behavior “unfair” within the meaning of the FTC Act.
53
53
See Manne & Stout, supra note 23, at 83.
...
Close
While such a balancing test is common in administrative proceedings and allows agencies to use their prosecutorial discretion, the way the FTC pursues companies alleged to have engaged in unreasonable data security practices differs from many other administrative adjudications given its overly post hoc nature.
54
54
See Alan Charles Raul & Vivek K. Mohan, United States, in The Privacy, Data Protection & Cybersecurity L. Rev. 376 (Alan Charles Raul ed., 5th ed. 2018), https://www.sidley.com/-/media/publications/united-states-fifth-edition.pdf?la=en [https://perma.cc/8LLV-AFWU] (“The US privacy system has a relatively flexible and non-prescriptive approach, relying more on post hoc government enforcement . . . and on the corresponding deterrent value of such enforcement . . . than on detailed prohibitions and rules.”).

Close
When a data breach occurs, the FTC decides whether or not to file a complaint based “only [on] those remedial measures it claim[s] would address the specific breach at issue,” and whether the company’s failure to institute those measures prior to the breach was unreasonable.
55
55
See Manne & Stout, supra note 23, at 79.
...
Close
The FTC has the benefit of hindsight: The data breach happened. But what the company is prosecuted for is not the data breach itself; it is the specific measures the company failed to take that would have prevented the breach.
When determining whether to bring a data security case, the agency “ignores the overall compliance burden on a company to avoid excessive risk without knowing, ex ante, which specific harm(s) might occur.”

Instead, the Commission’s data security staff make a post hoc determination of reasonableness without a “clear . . . baseline and a rigorous evaluation of the contribution of the company’s practices to any deviation from it.”

As a result, companies are penalized for the size of the data breach, not for their engagement in “unfair” or “unreason­able” data security practices.

There was no consideration of the percentage chance such a risk would have been ex ante (which was actually very low), nor credit given to LabMD for having a comprehensive data security program.

Such a post hoc approach invites arbitrary enforcement given that the reasonableness of ex ante data security measures is not the reason the FTC actually brings a case; it is the data breach itself that causes the FTC to become involved. As some scholars have described, the FTC “infer[s] a high prior probability, or even a certainty, of insufficient security from a single, post hoc occurrence . . . [and] imposes an effective strict liability regime on companies that experience a breach . . . .”

Companies that fail to adopt anything resembling “fair” or “reasonable” data security practices may never face FTC enforcement actions if they are lucky enough to never experience a data breach. Companies that have comprehensive data security programs, such as LabMD, may face FTC enforcement actions because a breach occurs. The single biggest factor in the “balancing test” employed by the FTC when deciding to bring a case is the breach that occurred, even if the company could not have, or reasonably would not have, considered the risk prior to the breach. Such an approach would be more acceptable if the FTC provided notice about what the ex ante “reasonable” data security measures are. But the Commission has failed on that metric, as is discussed next.
B. FTC Data Security Complaints, Consent Orders, and Security Assessments Provide Little Information
Even if parties were to look at the FTC’s published records in data security cases, the parties would find very little information about what the Commission considers appropriate data security practices. This is the result of the practical realities companies face following a data breach that cause quick settlements with the FTC, the lack of specificity in the materials the FTC makes available about its enforcement practices, and the fact that FTC complaints only detail what data security practices the FTC considers “unfair” post hoc (as in, after a data breach).
1. Practical Realities Make Settlements the Norm, Leading to Few Well-Reasoned Documents Explaining “Fair” or “Reasonable” Data Security Practices. — First, the practical realities for companies plagued with a data breach contribute to the limited nature of available documents on what the FTC considers appropriate data security practices. Companies exposed to data breaches typically want to mitigate the impact to their business and quickly settle with the FTC.
64
64
See Gina Stevens, Cong. Research Serv., R43723, The Federal Trade Commission’s Regulation of Data Security Under Its Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) Authority 7 (2014) (noting that “most of the FTC’s privacy and data security cases . . . [are] resolved with settlements or abandoned”); LabMD and the Future of FTC Data Privacy Regulation, supra note 31 (explaining that “[t]ypically, when an organization receives a Complaint from the FTC they choose to negotiate toward a settlement” because the alternative “legal battles are costly and time-consuming” and “[l]osing at any level will result in the issuance of a coercive order”).
...
Close
In fact, complaints and consent orders are often released on the same day, as companies already facing a data breach choose to settle before there is any public mention of an FTC complaint that could further harm their business.
65

...
Close
As a result, there is a lack of well-reasoned adjudicatory decisions by the Commission. The parties must rely on complaints, investigatory notices, and consent orders on the FTC’s website to get an idea of what the Commission considers to be “fair” or “reason­able” data security practices.
66
66
See Stevens, supra note 64, at 6–7 (noting that because of the prevalence of consent orders in data security enforcement actions, “there are few judicial decisions addressing the FTC’s authority to regulate the data security practices of companies which have suffered a data breach”); Manne & Stout, supra note 23, at 75.
...
Close
This limited number of available documents contributes to a lack of fair notice to parties about what data security prac­tices the FTC expects companies to adopt.
2. Available Documents Lack Specificity. — Second, the documents that do exist lack specificity about what the Commission considers appropriate data security practices. FTC complaints and investigatory notices only contain boilerplate language and make conclusory statements accusing companies of having “unreasonable” data security practices that led to data breaches.
67

See, e.g., LabMD, 894 F.3d at 1230 n.27 (describing the allegations in the FTC’s complaint as “unspecific and perhaps boilerplate”).

For example, in its complaint against HTC America, the FTC accused the company of: “(a) fail[ing] to implement an adequate program to assess the security of products it shipped to consumers; (b) fail[ing] to implement adequate privacy and security guidance or training for its engineering staff; . . .

These accusations are written in general language and lack the specificity a party trying to comply with FTC data security regulations could look to in order to find what the standards are. How does the FTC define “adequate privacy and security guidance,” for example? What about “well-known and commonly-accepted secure program­ming practices”? As a result of this general language, the complaints provide little guidance on what constitutes appropriate data security measures companies can take to avoid FTC enforcement actions against them.
The complaints also provide little guidance to regulated parties because they include no mention of the weight of the individual “reasonable” practices the company did not take. Invariably, the complaints include a sentence along these lines: “Respondent has engaged in a number of practices that, taken together, failed to provide reasonable security . . . .”

Consent decrees are another place regulated parties may hope to get information about what the Commission considers to be appropriate data security practices, but they are similarly deficient.

Another area where parties could look for guidance are the third-party privacy assessments that companies subject to consent orders are required to undergo annually or biannually.

...
Close
This benefits large corporations concerned about a decline in stock value from publicly available information about the corporation’s data security compliance. But the lack of meaning­ful public assessments also benefits the FTC because the compliance efforts the agency pursues do not have to follow a uniform approach for each corporation under a consent order. A particularly revealing quote from one FTC Commissioner suggests the efforts of the Commission staff go far beyond what can be gleaned from any assessment:
[A]ny privacy or data security assessment that is released to the public . . . will not provide a complete picture of a company’s compliance under an FTC order, or the FTC’s efforts in monitoring that company’s compliance. This is . . . because the FTC’s compliance monitoring efforts in many cases extend far beyond what can be gleaned from an isolated assessment.

As a result, what the FTC considers “reasonable” data security measures is further hidden from public view.

Such a requirement provides regulated parties not subject to FTC consent decrees little information about what the Commission considers appropriate data security, and may allow the Commission to regulate parties facing similar security threats differently. Given these prob­lems with the FTC’s current data security enforcement practice, the next Part discusses how regulated parties can be provided further notice of the FTC’s data security requirements.
III. Clarifying the FTC’s Data Security Enforcement Authority
Despite the lack of clear data security standards creating uncertainty for businesses about whether there will be an enforcement action following a data breach, a solution to the problem has “confounded Congress.”

This Part argues that there are two solutions to clarifying the FTC’s data security standards, one that requires congressional action and another that can be achieved without congressional action. Section III.A proposes that, as part of the larger privacy bill being considered already, Congress adopt a private security standard as a floor for data security requirements and create a special exception to the FTC’s burdensome rulemaking process specifically when more comprehensive data security regulations are neces­sary. Section III.B proposes that, with or without congressional action, regulated parties should begin commenting on FTC data security complaints, orders, and consent decrees to force the Commission to further specify what constitutes appropriate data security practices to avoid FTC enforce­ment actions.
A. Congress Should Adopt a Data Security Floor and Give the FTC Targeted Rulemaking Authority when Regulating Beyond the Floor Is Necessary
Part of the problem with current FTC data security enforcement practice is that Congress has provided no guidance as to whether the FTC is even the appropriate agency to police data security practices, never mind particular standards outside of a few specific industries.

If a company is not following those stand­ards, the FTC would have the ability to begin an enforcement action to force compli­ance. Second, Congress should provide the FTC with tar­geted rulemaking authority for either establishing more specific standards in individual industries that face unique data security challenges (and only those industries with unique challenges) or creating standards to respond to new cybersecurity threats faced by all data-holding industries. Importantly, the targeted rulemaking authority should be a specific data security exception to the FTC’s burdensome Magnuson–Moss rulemaking proce­dures—which include requirements like an informal hearing where interested parties are entitled to present oral testimony and potentially cross-examine witnesses—and be guided by the Administrative Procedure Act.

While this would give the FTC more authority, it would also help clarify the requirements to regulated parties.
There are likely two primary objections to such an approach. The first objection would likely come from opponents of big business who would advocate that private standards are not as rigorous as those the FTC may adopt if given complete rulemaking authority for data security regulation. However, the FTC may not have the expertise, budget, or number of employ­ees necessary to create the Commission’s own standards. Currently, the Commission has only forty employees dedicated to data security enforcement,
94
94

...
Close
which may be contributing to the current lack of clear enforce­ment standards. And the last time the federal government attempted to create cybersecurity standards—the Department of Commerce’s voluntary National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework—the task force ended up adopting five separate sets of industry standards, each of which comprises only part of the seventy-two data security practices that can be found through examination of FTC data security actions.
95
95
See Manne & Stout, supra note 23, at 74.
...
Close
Choosing one set of private industry standards would eliminate the complexity of establishing a floor and give the FTC the ability to focus on rulemaking in areas where more is needed as well as on enforcement.
The second objection would come from privacy advocates who have asked Congress to set up an entirely new data protection agency, contending that the FTC “has failed to enforce the orders it has established” and should be forced to focus on antitrust cases, not data security and privacy enforcement.

regulated parties should get the FTC to defend its settlements and consent orders on the record to add to the short list of available resources the FTC provides on its website to explain what it considers “fair” data security measures. One of the main problems with the FTC’s current approach to data security enforcement is that the agency is rarely forced to explain what the agency considers “unfair” because companies settle right away.

However, there is an underutilized tool that forces the FTC to provide more information. When the Commission issues a proposed consent order, the order is placed in the Federal Register and permits a comment period of thirty days before it becomes final.

The agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days . . . after which the Commission will decide whether to make the proposed consent order final.”).

When the consent order does become final, the FTC posts replies to all of the comments received during that thirty-day window.

See, e.g., TRENDnet Timeline, supra note 65 (including a link to “Letters to Commenters,” where the FTC includes its responses to all the comments received during the comment period).
...
Close
One possibility for receiving, and challenging, the FTC’s reasoning and enforcement authority might be to get the agency talking more by commenting on these proposed consent orders. While the FTC may be measured in the language it uses, asking specific questions about what the Commission plans to do to enforce the order, for example, could be a way to better understand how the current enforcement practices work.
Conclusion
For the past couple of decades, the FTC has increasingly sought to become America’s chief data privacy and security enforcer despite its mission as an antitrust agency. The FTC has used the broad language in Section 5 of the FTC Act to garner expansive authority to bring enforcement proceedings for what the Commission deems “unfair” data security practices. This Comment shows that regulated parties lack adequate notice about what “fair” data security practices means. Now, after the Eleventh Circuit called the FTC’s data security enforcement authority into question in LabMD, the FTC’s authority in this space faces significant uncertainty. To clarify data security standards to regulated parties, Congress should provide clear authority to the FTC—as part of the larger privacy bill being discussed in Congress—using a private industry standard as the floor and enabling the FTC to regulate beyond that only when an industry faces a unique data security challenge or new cybersecurity threats necessitate further base expectations for all data-holding industries. Whether or not Congress enacts new data security legislation, regulated parties should begin commenting on FTC data security complaints, orders, and consent decrees to force the Commission to better articulate its data security requirements.
The core tenet of American administrative law is the prevention of arbitrary government.
