Invasion of Privacy.
Your privacy and the privacy of your loved ones is more than just an expectation. It’s a fundamental legal right that can and should be vigorously protected.
In these times of nearly invisible cameras, drone helicopters and data breaches, it’s easier than ever for people or organizations to violate your fundamental right to privacy, creating a problem for you and your loved ones – and potentially resulting in a claim.
If you believe you have a claim, seek advice from an experienced attorney who will help you determine its validity and the next steps that you should take.
Have a Question or Need More Information?
Simply fill out the following form:
Please enter the word you see in the image
Q I believe someone has spied on me. What should I do?
A Usually it is a good idea to report any suspected illegal activity to the police.
Q Do I have a case against someone for spying on me with a hidden camera or drone?
A Depending on the circumstances, you certainly might. Illinois law, for example, recognizes an action for “intrusion upon seclusion” that covers a variety of things from eavesdropping to wiretapping. The key is whether the intrusion into your privacy would be “highly offensive to a reasonable person.” If you think you might have a case, call us.
Q What is my case worth?
A Each case depends on its own facts. Anyone who hears a little bit about your case and tells you what it’s worth doesn’t know what they’re talking about. The value of each case depends on many things – liability (whose fault was it), the severity of the injury, the amount of monetary damages (medical bills, lost wages, etc), the permanency of the injury, and many other things. With personal injury and medical malpractice cases, it can be difficult to predict what a jury would do. When we accept a case, we will let you know once the case is ready for potential settlement what we think a reasonable verdict range is, and then we will help you decide whether to settle the case or take it to trial.
Q How long will my case take?
A Each case is different. Some cases come into our office and are resolved in a few weeks – some take several years. Again, this depends on the nature of the case and severity of the injuries. In many cases we want to wait until you heal up before we try to get the case resolved. In other cases, that simply isn’t possible. We pursue all of our cases diligently – we want to get them done for you quickly and efficiently – but we don’t sacrifice quality to get them done fast.
Q Will I need money up front?
A In most cases, we don’t charge money up front. We typically work on a contingent fee – meaning that we get a percentage of whatever we get you. When we do that, we don’t charge you if we lose the case. We also don’t make you pay for case costs along the way. If we win or settle, those costs come out of your settlement. If we lose, you don’t owe us anything for costs. In some cases, we charge an hourly rate – usually because the case hopefully won’t take a lot of time and it would be unfair for us to charge a percentage of a relatively easily recovery. Either way, we discuss all fee issues with you up front before you sign up with us.
Q Do you do free consultations?
A We will talk to you about your case on the phone to see if we can help you. We won’t give you legal advice or tell you what to do when you first call us because we frankly won’t know enough about the case to give you the type of advice you deserve. If you come in to meet with us, you don’t owe us anything for the initial visit.
Q Do I need an attorney? If so, why Warner & Zimmerle?
A In any serious case, it’s usually a good idea to have an attorney. Of course, we turn down cases nearly every day where we can’t help the person. Why do we do that? Because if we took those cases, the client wouldn’t be happy and we wouldn’t be happy (and frankly probably wouldn’t make any money). Call us, and we will do our best to tell you if you need an attorney. As for why you should pick us? We believe our bios and our success record speak for themselves.
Q Someone said I should pick a Chicago attorney. Is that true?
A No. While there are some great lawyers in Chicago, there are great lawyers right here in the Quad Cities. Look at our resumes and speak with us before you call someone from out of the area. We think you’ll find that we have the experience, skills, and personal touch you are looking for.

What Our Clients Say...
“I hired another attorney who worked on my case for two years and gave up. No other lawyers would take my case until I found Howard, who settled my case two months later for $100,000. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a good lawyer!”
