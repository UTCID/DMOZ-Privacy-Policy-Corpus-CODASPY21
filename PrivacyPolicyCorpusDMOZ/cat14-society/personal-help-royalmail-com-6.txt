You can apply for a redirection online.
Before you start you'll need:
A Royal Mail online account. If you haven’t got one already, you can set one up as part of your application. You can use it for other Royal Mail services like the shop and Click & Drop.
The full address and postcode of both your old and new addresses.
The full names and dates of birth of everyone whose mail needs redirecting.
A valid credit or debit card. This must be in the name of the person applying and registered at either your old or new address. Please note: we don’t accept American Express or pre-paid cards.
Please be aware: You may have to answer some security questions to apply online. This is to make sure only authorised people can set up a Redirection. In this case you’ll also need:
Access to documents such as bank/credit card/loan information or mobile phone contract details.
When should I apply for a Redirection?
You should apply as soon as possible, as we need at least five working days to arrange it. It’s best to apply three weeks before you move. This gives plenty of time to set up the Redirection.
You can apply:
Up to six months before your move
Up to six months after you’ve moved
Please note: If you give less than five working days’ notice of your move, some of your mail might be delivered to your old address.
Can I apply for a Redirection for other people?
Yes, if you all live at the same address. Please include everyone’s full names on the application, even if you all share the same surname.
You can’t arrange a Redirection for people who don’t live at the same address as you, unless you have Power of Attorney. You can also arrange a Redirection for the mail of someone who has died. In both these circumstances you’ll need to apply either at a Post Office® or by post.
.
When do I need to apply for a Redirection at the Post Office® or by post?
If you’re applying for more than 8 people.
If you’re applying on behalf of the deceased or for people you have Power of Attorney for. To apply for these Redirections, you’ll need to show the appropriate documentation. You’ll find the Special Circumstances application form and terms and conditions here.
If you’re redirecting mail to a British Forces Post Office (BFPO) address.
How long does it take for my redirected mail to arrive?
Your mail will go to the delivery office for your old address first, before it’s forwarded. This will add at least a day to its journey.
If you’ve moved within the UK: we’ll forward your mail by 1st Class, unless it was sent by Special Delivery Guaranteed®. Items sent by this service will still require a signature, but guaranteed delivery dates won't apply.
If you’ve moved outside the UK: we’ll forward your mail by International Standard.
I'm worried about my Personal Safety, can you help with my Redirection?
If you are setting up a Redirection because of personal safety concerns please don't apply online, call us on 03457 777 888
(Our lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 8am to 1pm).
Please tell our staff why you are calling to set up a Redirection and they will be able to help. All calls are confidential.
