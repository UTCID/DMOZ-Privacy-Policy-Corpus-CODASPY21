The School will use personal information its collects from you for the primary purpose of collection, and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection and reasonably expected, or to which you have consented.
The School will not collect personal information unless reasonably necessary for it to perform its function. If the School receives unsolicited personal information and determines that it should not have been collected, it will be destroyed.
