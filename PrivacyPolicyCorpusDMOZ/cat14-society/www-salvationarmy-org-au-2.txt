Court and prison support
Share
Our chaplains are available at most major courts and some prisons.
They can offer help with your spiritual and mental wellbeing, make referrals to other helpful agencies for you or can just sit down with you for a chat.
Our court and prison chaplains provide support and friendship to families before, during and after legal proceedings, as well as to offenders.
Going to court or prison can be incredibly daunting, not just to people involved but to their families and friends as well. Sometimes the feelings of isolation, guilt and shame can be overwhelming, particularly for the families and parents of offenders. Having someone to support you and to help you understand the process you’re about to go through can make a huge difference.
Our chaplains are available to provide emotional and/or spiritual support without discrimination for:
Victims of crime
Families of victims
Offenders
Families of offenders
Witnesses
Any people in the Court and prison system
People referred by a court or legal representative to participate in the Positive Lifestyle Program
Enquiries about loved ones
We can try to help you find out about the welfare of someone who is going to court or is in prison.
Supporting prisoners
Our chaplains provide a range of support, without discrimination, to adult and juvenile prisoners through:
Weekly visits
Chapel services
Regular Bibles studies
Spiritual counselling
We also use our extensive network to assist prisoners with post-release support.
