Copyright Matters
We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we prohibit users from uploading, posting or otherwise transmitting on the Site or Service any materials that violate another party's intellectual property rights. When we receive proper Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement as described below, we act in accordance with the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. If you believe that any material on the Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may send a written notification of such infringement to our Designated Agent.
1. Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement
If you believe that your own copyrighted work is accessible on the Site or Service in violation of your copyright, you may provide our Designated Agent with a written communication as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) that contains substantially the following information:
Identification in sufficient detail of the copyrighted work(s) or intellectual property that you claim has been infringed so that we can locate the material, such as a direct page link to your own web site where the work can be found, or a U.S. copyright registration certificate number. If multiple works at a single web site are covered by your Notification, you may provide a representative list.
Identify the URL or other specific location on the OneWed.com website that contains the material that you claim infringes your copyright. You must provide us with reasonably sufficient information, such as, "The picture/text/other content at https://www.onewed.com/accounts/ViewImage?IMID=XYZ infringes on my copyright."
Provide the physical signature on the paper of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf.
State that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
State that the information contained in your Notice is accurate, and that under the penalty of perjury, you attest that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Include your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address.
You may submit your Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement to our Designated Agent by mail:
OneWed Inc. ATTN: Copyright Agent, 1043 St Patrick Street, Victoria, BC, Canada V8S 4Y2;
You may be liable for damages, including court costs and attorneys fees, if you misrepresent that content on our website and/or service infringes copyrights. Filing a false Notification is perjury.
Upon receiving a complete notification as described, we will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and promptly notify the alleged infringer of your claim. We also will advise the alleged infringer of the DMCA statutory Counter Notification procedure described below, by which the alleged infringer may respond to your claim and request that we restore this material.
2. Counter Notification
If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from our website and/or service as a result of mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written Counter Notification to our Designated Agent pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2) and (3). To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include substantially the following:
Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found.
A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that filed the Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement or the party's agent.
Your name, address and telephone number.
The statement "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that each item of content identified as allegedly infringing was alleged to be infringing and was removed or disabled only as a result of a mistake or misidentification of that content, or that the content identified by the complainant has been removed or disabled at the URL identified and will no longer be shown."
Your physical signature on the paper.
You may submit your Counter Notification by mail:
OneWed Inc. ATTN: Copyright Agent, 1043 St Patrick Street, Victoria, BC, Canada V8S 4Y2;
If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled material after 10 business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party filing the original Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.
Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a false response in such a manner is perjury.
Repeat Infringers
In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable law, we have a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, those who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Company may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Site and/or terminate the memberships of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
