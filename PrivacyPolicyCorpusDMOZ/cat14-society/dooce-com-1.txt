Terms of Service
Accepting the Terms of Service
The purpose of this website, www.dooce.com (the “Site”), owned and operated by Armstrong Media, LLC (“dooce”), a Utah corporation, is to provide entertainment and lifestyle websites. Please read these terms of service (“Agreement”) carefully before using the Site or any services provided on the Site (collectively, “Services”). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Services. The Services are accessed by You (“Subscriber” or “You”) under the following terms and conditions:
Access to the Services
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, dooce may offer to provide the Services, as described more fully on the Site, and which are selected by Subscriber, solely for Subscriber’s own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. Services shall include, but not be limited to, any services dooce performs for Subscriber, as well as the offering of any Content (as defined below) on the Site. dooce may change, suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content. dooce may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict Subscriber’s access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. dooce reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting revised Terms of Service on the Site and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the Site. Subscriber shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Services by Subscriber following such modification constitutes Subscriber’s acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.
Subscriber certifies to dooce that if Subscriber is an individual (i.e., not a corporate entity), Subscriber is at least 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to or on dooce (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address). Subscriber also certifies that it is legally permitted to use the Services and access the Site, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Site. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Site is revoked in such jurisdictions. dooce makes no claim that the Site may be lawfully viewed or that Content may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If You access the Site from outside the United States, You do so at Your own risk and You are responsible for compliance with the laws of Your jurisdiction.
dooce will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Site and Services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Site and/or Services will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment. Every reasonable step will be taken by dooce to minimize such disruption where it is within dooce’s reasonable control.
You agree that neither dooce nor the Site will be liable in any event to you or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Site, the service, your Subscriber Content or other Content.
dooce retains the right to create limits on use and storage in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.
Subscriber shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access the Site or otherwise use the Services, including, without limitation, modems, hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service. Subscriber shall be responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services.
