As such, the Foundation does not share, trade or sell information about its donors or funders to third parties in any form, for any purpose. This includes, but is not limited to, e-mail addresses.
From time to time the Foundation sends out materials such as requests for proposals, press releases or reports produced by the Foundation or its grantees to friends, donors, colleagues, grantees, potential applicants or the media. These materials are sent only to those specific people or organizations that the Foundation believes will be interested in that particular correspondence.
While fully complying with all legal requirements related to identifying donors and funders, the Foundation does not publish nor in any way disseminate the names of its donors and funders unless specifically asked to do so by the donor or funder.
