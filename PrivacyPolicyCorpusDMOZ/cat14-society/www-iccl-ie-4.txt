One of the biggest threats to your privacy and personal information is mass surveillance of populations, carried out by governments and corporations alike. In the wrong hands, this data can be
used to target journalists and activists and to clamp down on free
speech. And let’s face it, there are no “right” hands to be handle private information about everything you do online.
You are entitled to your private life – both online and off.
Click here for Spying on Dissent, an ICCL/INCLO report on how governments across the globe use technology to spy on activists and protesters.
Read about our case against the UK for mass surveillance of its population,
taken in partnership with 9 other NGOs at the European Court of Human Rights.
Together with our colleagues at the International Network for Civil
Liberties Organisations (INCLO), we put questions to governments as to
what information they share with each other, and why. The answers were
less than satisfactory. Read on at this link.
In 2017, together with our colleagues at Digital Rights Ireland, we made a submission to the government on the Data Retention Bill. In it, we set out all the ways that particular bill violated fundamental rights and the steps that needed to be taken to protect them.
