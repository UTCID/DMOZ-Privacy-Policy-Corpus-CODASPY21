on Council of Europe Convention on
Cyber-Crime

October 18, 2000
Dear Council of Europe Secretary General Walter
Schwimmer and COE Committee of Experts on Cyber
Crime,
We write to you on behalf of a wide range of civil
society organizations from around the world to object to
the proposed Convention on Cyber-Crime. We believe that
the draft treaty is contrary to well established norms
for the protection of the individual, that it improperly
extends the police authority of national governments,
that it will undermine the development of network
security techniques, and that it will reduce government
accountability in future law enforcement conduct.
Specifically, we object to provisions that will
require Internet Service Providers to retain records
regarding the activities of their customers. (Articles
17, 18, 24, 25). These provisions pose a significant risk
to the privacy and human rights of Internet users and are
at odds with well established principles of data
protection such as the Data Protection Directive of the
European Union. Similar communications transaction
information has been used in the past to identify
dissidents and to persecute minorities. We urge you not
to establish this requirement in a modern communication
network. In our view the whole of Article 18 is
incompatible with Article 8 of the ECHR and with the
jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.
We further object to the conception of "Illegal
Devices" set out in Article 6. We believe that this
concept lacks sufficient specificity to ensure that it
will not become an all-purpose basis to investigate
individuals engaged in computer-related activity that is
completely lawful. As technical experts have made clear,
this provision will also discourage the development of
new security tools and give government an improper role
in policing scientific innovation.
We also object to the dramatic extension of copyright
crimes in the proposed Article 10. It is hardly a settled
matter that criminal penalties are the appropriate remedy
for copyright infringement, nor do the underlying
treaties referenced impose such requirements. New
criminal penalties should not be established by
international convention in an area where national law is
so unsettled. More generally, we disagree with
initiatives that allow for mutual assistance without
dual-criminality. This requirement is central to
preserving the sovereign authority of nations.
Additionally, we believe that clear procedures must be
agreed upon in international investigations, and that no
law enforcement agency within a different jurisdiction
should act on behalf of another nation without clear
investigative procedures within its own jurisdiction.
Different countries have different procedures,
admittedly, but now is the opportunity to harmonize them,
on the condition that we assure a high level of
consistency on individual rights protections.
The criminal provisions of Articles 9 and 11 could
lead to a chilling effect on the free flow of information
and ideas. Imposing liability on Internet Service
Providers for third party content places an unreasonable
burden on providers of new network services and will
encourage inappropriate monitoring of private
communications.
Article 14 setting out the requirements for search and
seizure of stored computer data lacks necessary
procedural safeguards to safeguard the rights of the
individual and to ensure due process of law. In
particular, there is no effort to ensure that an
independent judicial review, ensuring the respect of
basic freedoms and liberties, occurs before a search by
the state is undertaken. Such searches would constitute
an "arbitrary interference" under international legal
norms.
Articles 14 and 15 could establish a requirement for
government access to encryption keys that would compel
individuals to incriminate themselves which may well be
incompatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on
Human Rights and with the jurisprudence of the European
Court of Human Rights. We also question the ambiguity
that arises within this same article on government access
to decryption keys. The Council of Europe should clarify
this provision so that member countries do not take the
convention to be a mandate for passing legislation
allowing for self-incrimination.
We also object in very strong terms to the manner
under which this proposal was developed. Police agencies
and powerful private interests acting outside of the
democratic means of accountability have sought to use a
closed process to establish rules that will have the
effect of binding legislation. We believe this process
violates requirements of transparency and is at odds with
democratic decisionmaking.
Privacy experts have made clear their opposition to
this proposal. One expert warned that efforts to develop
an international convention on "Cyber crime" would lead
to "fundamental restrictions on privacy, anonymity and
encryption."
Data Protection officials have made clear their
opposition to this proposal. The International Working
Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications earlier
criticized attempts to require maintaining traffic data
and recommended improvements in security over new
criminal laws.
Technical experts have made clear their opposition to
this proposal. A letter from leading security
practitioners, educators, and vendors states that "the
proposed treaty may inadvertently result in criminalizing
techniques and software commonly used to make computer
systems resistant to attack" and that the proposed treaty
"would adversely impact security practitioners,
researchers, and educators."
Now a wide range of organizations representing civil
society across the world make clear our opposition to
this proposal.
We believe that any proposal to create new
investigative and prosecutorial authority should include
a careful consideration of articles 8 and 10 of the
European Convention on Human Rights and the related
jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. We
do not believe that these instruments were given adequate
consideration in the development of this proposal.
Further, we believe that the OECD Cryptography Policy
Guidelines and the OECD Guidelines for the Security of
Information Systems reflect a more balanced,
forward-looking view of the need to promote strong
security techniques to reduce the risk of computer crime
than the proposal now under consideration.
Finally, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
speaks directly to the obligations of government to
protect the privacy of communication and to preserve
freedom of expression in new media. Article 12 states
that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference
with his privacy, family, home or correspondence."
Article 19 further states that "Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers."
We urge you not to approve the treaty proposal at this
time. We, the undersigned, are ready to support the CoE
with experts in the area to provide a better version of
the document, aimed not only at punishing, but also at
preventing computer crimes.
