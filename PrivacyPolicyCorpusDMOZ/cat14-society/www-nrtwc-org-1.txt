Donor and/or Member Policy
The National Right to Work Committee believes the privacy of contributors and members is paramount.  The Committee will not share, sell or exchange donor or member information for third party fundraising or marketing purposes.  And, the Committee strives to protect the First Amendment right of its members and supporters to associate with the Committee in private to promote its cause.  That means opposing unconstitutional or unlawful demands for donor or member information from union officials, government officials, or others.
E-mail Policy
By submitting your e-mail address, you agree to receive occasional (approximately twice per week) breaking news updates from the Committee.  Your e-mail address will not be used for any other purpose. It will be held in strict confidence and will never be sold, rented, or distributed to anyone for any reason.  You may unsubscribe from the list at any time.
