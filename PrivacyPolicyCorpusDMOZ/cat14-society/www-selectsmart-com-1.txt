The SelectSmart.com Selector Methodology
Our selectors use a numeric point system.
If an item has a trait or characteristic you desire, then that item "earns" a certain number of points.
In some cases if it is trait you do not want, points are subtracted.
We are dedicated to continuous improvement.
Please notify us if you have corrections or suggestions.
