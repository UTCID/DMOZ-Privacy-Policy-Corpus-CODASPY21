Shop Policies
Our Products:
Our products are hand-made by Friendship Bridge clients. Each product is unique and may vary slightly in measurement and/or appearance because of the weaving process. Items made from re-purposed huipiles and cortes are unique and may vary from photos.
Shipping:
We charge shipping based on order size and items ordered*. Most orders are processed within two to four business days. Once your order ships from us, average delivery time for standard shipping is 3-5 business days. Large orders may take longer. Please make sure that the ship-to address on your order is correct. Manual address corrections due to errors will delay your package significantly and/or result in additional shipping charges.
*Additional charges apply to shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories, and international destinations – please contact orders@friendshipbridge.org for a rate quote.
Payment:
We accept Credit Cards directly on our site and payments via PayPal.
Returns & Exchanges:
If We Made An Error or Your Item Arrives Damaged:
In the event that a problem with your merchandise is the result of our error, please contact us at orders@friendshipbridge.org to make arrangements.
How to Return/Exchange an Item:
Your item must be in its original unused condition to be returned, unless there is a product defect. We must receive the returned item within 30 days of purchase.
Please email Friendship Bridge at orders@friendshipbridge.org to request a refund or exchange and we will assign you a tracking #. Be sure to include your order number.
Items must arrive back to us in their original shipped condition with all original tags attached and original packaging and parts included. We do not charge a restocking fee, however, we do not refund the original shipping and handling that you paid on the order. Any credit or refund due will be applied to the original method of payment used for the purchase.
Include a signed letter stating the reason for your return and the original receipt or packing list.
You may return your package via the carrier of your choice. For your protection, we suggest using a shipping service that provides delivery confirmation, and that you insure the package for the value of the item(s) enclosed. You will be responsible for all return shipping costs.
Send your returned item to:
Friendship Bridge Artisan Project
405 Urban St, Suite 140
Lakewood, CO 80228
Return exceptions:
Returns must be received within 30 days of the purchase date. Merchandise that has been worn, used, damaged, dirty or altered will not be accepted for return or exchange. No credit can be issued until we have inspected the returned item and it is found to be in new, unused, unlaundered condition (if applicable) with all original tags attached and original packaging and parts included. Refunds will be issued for the amount paid for the item. Original shipping charges will not be refunded.
If a customer returns any item for credit that received a discount or promotional savings, and the lower order total would not meet the original minimum qualifications for the discount, then the amount of the sale discount shall be deducted from the refund amount.
If You Are Returning a Gift
We are happy to exchange a gift within 30 days of purchase for another item of equal value from our store. Follow the Return instructions above. Returns for refund less shipping charges (or partial refund in the event an item of lesser value is requested as an exchange) are credited back to the original method of payment used for the original purchase.
International Returns
Please contact us before returning an item shipped internationally. You may contact us at orders@friendshipbridge.org.
Sales Tax
Our stores collect and pay sales tax in some U.S. states as required by law. If sales tax is applicable to your order it will be calculated and shown during check-out.
