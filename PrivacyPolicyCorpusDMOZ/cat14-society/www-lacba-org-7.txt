Jim McCullaugh Receives the LA County Volunteer of the Year Award From the LA County Board of Supervisors
On April 3rd, 2019, Domestic Violence Legal Services Project volunteer, Jim McCaullugh, was honored as a Los Angeles County Volunteer of the Year by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Until recently he had his own private practice in Sherman Oaks focusing on family law and estate planning.
In the early part of his career he was a journalist/editor for Billboard Magazine and was later publisher of American Cinematographer magazine. He still consults in the publishing world. Having volunteered with DVP since 2014, and given over 550 hours of his time, Jim was selected for his dedication to providing legal assistance to victims of domestic violence.
“What inspires me about the work is that we can help people on the same day as they come in. There is an immediacy about it that is profound and it genuinely feels that we are helping to stop imminent harm. It’s some of the most fulfilling work I have ever done.” –Jim McCaullugh
For information on
volunteering with the DVP please visit https://www.lacba.org/domestic-violence-legal-services-project
Carlos Dominguez Honored as a Los Angeles County Volunteer of the Year
On April 23, 2018, Domestic Violence Project Volunteer, Carlos Dominguez, was honored as a Los Angeles County Volunteer of the Year. Carlos is a Deputy Attorney General with the California Attorney General's Office, where he practices criminal appellate law. Having volunteered with the DVP since 2015, and given over 150 hours of his time, Carlos was selected for his dedication to providing legal assistance to victims of domestic violence. Every month, he takes time to come into the clinic to help victims, showing compassion and respect for each person he assists. His positive attitude, warm demeanor, and professionalism are all valued by our clients and staff. As a native Spanish speaker, his help is particularly effective and needed in the community.
"The Domestic Violence Project provides victims with first-rate legal help and a safe environment in which to share their stories. It’s rewarding to help victims through the complicated process of obtaining a restraining order. For many, the experience reveals courage that they never realized they had." *Carlos Dominguez
Congratulations Carlos!

LACBA Domestic Violence Legal Services Project Testimonials
LACBA's Domestic Violence Legal Services Project has assisted more than 100,000 men, women and children since it was founded more than 35 years ago.
Below, a few of those survivors share their story of how the Project helped them down the path to a safer life.
MAKING A DIFFERENCE:

About the Domestic Violence Legal Services Project
For more than three decades, battered and broken victims of domestic violence have solemnly made the trip to Los Angeles Superior Court seeking help. With them come their wounds, their injuries, their fears, and often their children. Navigating the judicial maze that comprises Stanley Mosk Courthouse is an intimidating task. Yet the victims come. They are sent by law enforcement, shelters, social workers, or driven by their personal desire for physical salvation and safety.
They come because they have been told there is help. And they are right... there is help. That help is you…volunteers. Often, the relief sought is granted on the same day.  Volunteers are attorneys, paralegals, and law students, and they work under the supervision of the Domestic Violence Legal Services Project.
Attorney volunteer Geoffrey Moss says, “Volunteering at LACBA’s Domestic Violence Legal Services Project has been a rewarding way to give back and provide immediate, meaningful help to those in need. Domestic violence is an issue that affects people from all walks of life, and the Project is a wonderful resource to help them navigate a daunting and unfamiliar legal system. Giving back to the community through pro bono work is an expectation at my firm, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, and the fact that six Orrick associates choose to give their time to the project speaks volumes about its importance.”
Volunteer sessions are during court hours Monday-Friday. No prior experience necessary, but computer efficiency is required. Onsite training is provided by DVP staff. No ongoing representation is necessary. Bring with you nothing but your compassion and willingness to make a difference in someone's life.
Thank you on behalf of those we serve.
