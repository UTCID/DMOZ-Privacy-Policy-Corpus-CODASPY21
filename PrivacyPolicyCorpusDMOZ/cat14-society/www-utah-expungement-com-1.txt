Privacy Policy
We appreciate the interest you have taken in our site. We will not use any personal information that was not voluntarily given to use. Our goal is to provide information and resources to those seeking record expungement in the state of Utah. We realize how important it is for someone convicted of a crime to be able to decide who gets to see and use that information.
If our privacy policy changes at any time, we will update the information on this page.
