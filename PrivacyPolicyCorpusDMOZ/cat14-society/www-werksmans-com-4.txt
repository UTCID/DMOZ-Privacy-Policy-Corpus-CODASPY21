2020 the Department of Employment and Labour published a statement regarding
the new deadlines for TERS applications and the delay in payments (“statement“).According to the
statement, deadlines for the TERS applications have been extended. No
applications will be accepted beyond the new deadline dates. Claims which have
already been submitted will not be affected by the deadline.  The new dates
are the following: March 2020 to May 2020, applications close on 25 September 2020;June 2020, applications close on 15 October 2020; andJuly to 15 September 2020, applications close on 30 October 2020.The statement also notes that the TERS payments
are currently still on hold. This is due to the Unemployment Insurance Fund
(“UIF“) working with the
Department of Home Affairs and other government databases to verify the
identity documents in those who applied for the benefit.The full statement may be accessed at: http://www.labour.gov.za/unemployment-insurance-funds-announces-new-closing-dates-for-covid-19-ters-benefit-payments. Careers at WerksmansWe focus on people.
