WHO YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH
SMi does not share your personal data with any third parties other than as set out below and in the section “Disclosure of Your Information”. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Companies in the SAE Group
SMi is part of the SAE International group of companies. We may share your personal data with relevant group companies (“Group Companies”) to the extent required for the processing purposes set out above. In particular, these Group Companies include ABP International, Inc. (doing business as Tech Briefs Media Group), SAE International, Thorn Hill LLC, SAE Industry Technologies Consortia, and Performance Review Institute.
Service Providers
We share your personal data with our service providers, who provide us with certain business and administrative services, to the extent necessary as part of those services. For example, we may use third party service providers or applications to send emails or engage in calling campaigns on our behalf. All our third party service providers are vetted and checked and only process your personal data on our instructions.
Event Sponsors
We may hold events or webinars in conjunction with certain selected sponsoring partner organizations (“Third Party Sponsors”). Information about any specific Third Party Sponsors of an event or webinar will be made available on the sign-up page for that event or webinar. We share the personal data you provide on signing up for a sponsored event or webinar with that Third Party Sponsor. Subject to applicable law and any preferences you have expressed, that Third Party Sponsor may use your information for its own marketing purposes.

§ With HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other governmental or regulatory authorities who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.
§ If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation to which we are subject, in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SMi, our customers, or other third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Sharing of Presentation Material
As part of the service provided by SMi all event presentations are shared with the attendees of the event after the event has ended. These presentations are stored and converted to PDF format and can only be accessed using the Document Portal login.
Presenters can choose not to have their presentations or biographies posted to the Document Portal. These requests should be made in writing at the time of the agreement to speak at the event. Should you wish to update or remove this information from the Document Portal in the future, these requests must be made to the database team at SMi (data@smi-online.co.uk) who will process your request.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
We share your personal data within the SAE International Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the UK and/or the European Economic Area (EEA). Some of our external third party service providers or Third Party Sponsors may be based outside the UK and/or the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK/EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK/EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK authorities (or, where applicable, the European Commission).
We may use specific contracts approved by the UK authorities (or, where applicable, the European Commission) which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we transfer data to entities based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK/EEA.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA
We only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party (for example) our Group Companies)) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests, which include developing our products and services, growing our business, keeping our product and services relevant, efficiently fulfilling our legal and contractual duties and managing legal risk, providing high-quality customer service, and keeping you informed (including marketing).
Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
Where you have provided your consent (see “Marketing” below).
Marketing – General
We may use your personal data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you. You will receive marketing communications from us if: (a) you have requested information from us, or (b) you have purchased goods or services from us or we have a legitimate interest in marketing to you, and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. You may also receive marketing communications regarding relevant products and services from our Group Companies where (a) you have requested such information or (b) where you have not opted out and we have a legitimate interest in marketing to you.

WHAT IS CPD?
CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development’. It is essentially a philosophy,
which maintains that in order to be effective, learning should be organised and
structured. The most common definition is:
‘A commitment to structured skills and knowledge enhancement for Personal or Professional
competence’
CPD is a common requirement of individual membership with professional bodies and
Institutes. Increasingly, employers also expect their staff to undertake regular
CPD activities.
Undertaken over a period of time, CPD ensures that educational qualifications do
not become obsolete, and allows for best practice and professional standards to
be upheld.
CPD can be undertaken through a variety of learning activities including instructor
led training courses, seminars and conferences, e:learning modules or structured
reading.
CPD AND PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES
There are approximately 470 institutes in the UK across all industry sectors, with
a collective membership of circa 4 million professionals, and they all expect their
members to undertake CPD.
For some institutes undertaking CPD is mandatory e.g. accountancy and law, and linked
to a licence to practice, for others it’s obligatory. By ensuring that their members
undertake CPD, the professional bodies seek to ensure that professional standards,
legislative awareness and ethical practices are maintained.
CPD Schemes often run over the period of a year and the institutes generally provide
online tools for their members to record and reflect on their CPD activities.
TYPICAL CPD SCHEMES AND RECORDING OF CPD (CPD points and hours)
Professional bodies and Institutes CPD schemes are either structured as ‘Input’
or ‘Output’ based.
‘Input’ based schemes list a precise number of CPD hours that individuals must achieve
within a given time period. These schemes can also use different ‘currencies’ such
as points, merits, units or credits, where an individual must accumulate the number
required. These currencies are usually based on time i.e. 1 CPD point = 1 hour of
learning.
‘Output’ based schemes are learner centred. They require individuals to set learning
goals that align to professional competencies, or personal development objectives.
These schemes also list different ways to achieve the learning goals e.g. training
courses, seminars or e:learning, which enables an individual to complete their CPD
through their preferred mode of learning.
The majority of Input and Output based schemes actively encourage individuals to
seek appropriate CPD activities independently.
As a formal provider of CPD certified activities, SMI Group can provide an indication
of the learning benefit gained and the typical completion. However, it is ultimately
the responsibility of the delegate to evaluate their learning, and record it correctly
in line with their professional body’s or employers requirements.
GLOBAL CPD
Increasingly, international and emerging markets are ‘professionalising’ their workforces
and looking to the UK to benchmark educational standards. The undertaking of CPD
is now increasingly expected of any individual employed within today’s global marketplace.
CPD Certificates
We can provide a certificate for all our accredited events. To request a CPD certificate for a conference , workshop, master classes you have attended please email events@smi-online.co.uk
