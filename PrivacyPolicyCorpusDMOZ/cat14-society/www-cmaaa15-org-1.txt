You are here: Home / PrivacyParticipation in Health Information Exchange (KeyHIE)
The doctors and nurses who care for you need timely access to your health information. A health information exchange, or HIE, is a service that allows health information to securely move electronically between physicians, hospitals and other healthcare professionals so it can be accessed when it is needed for patient care.
CMAOI participates in a health information exchange. If you do NOT want this healthcare professional and/or facility to make your health information available through the exchange, please notify the staff at our registration desk.
