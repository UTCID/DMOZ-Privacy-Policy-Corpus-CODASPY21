Founders FamilyWhen you give a gift that will serve the needs of generations to come by including the Lutheran Social Services Foundation in your Estate Plan you are eligible to be a member of the Founders Family of the LSS Foundation.
Such a gift could be made through a bequest by Will, a charitable gift annuity, life insurance program, trust arrangement, or by a leadership gift (a current gift of $10,000 or accumulation thereof) to the Foundation.
The Founders Family was established by the LSS Foundation Board of Directors in 1994 to recognize LSS legacy givers. Founder Family members receive a special LSS Founders Family clock as a small token of appreciation and a reminder of your gift yet to come. Each year we invite all Founders Family members to a special luncheon with the Board to induct new members and celebrate all Founders Family members.
You may choose to be listed anonymously, but please do let us recognize you. We'd like the opportunity to thank you during your lifetime. Also, your gift may inspire others to give in this way. Your participation will help us educate friends of LSS on this type of gift-giving, providing visibility of this opportunity to ensure the mission of Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota continues for generations to come.
To discuss becoming a Founders Family member or to notify us that you have already included LSS in your Estate, please contact:
