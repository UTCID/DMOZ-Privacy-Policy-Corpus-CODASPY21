The History of Privacy and the Future of AI
with Dr. Teresa Scassa
Canada Research Chair in Information Law and Policy
Faculty of Law
University of Ottawa
Abstract
Artificial intelligence relies upon massive quantities of data to train and develop algorithms. The growing use of AI by public and private sector actors to make decisions about individuals – their health, their entitlements, their employment and even their freedom – means that AI applications consume an enormous volume of data about humans. It is no surprise, then, that data protection laws are playing a significant role in the regulation of AI. This talk will explore the history of privacy and what it might tell us about the future of AI.
