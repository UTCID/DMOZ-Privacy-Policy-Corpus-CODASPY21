Bev,
You're a natural on camera!
Super engaging.
I loved Part 2 in particular.
Very honest with your words on your Dad.
They're the types of stories that are so relatable, I'm sure, to so many people.
And a big congratulations on your Sunshine Coast article being published those years ago.
A true sign of what you're doing is helping people!
Looking forward to the next YouTube instalment!!
