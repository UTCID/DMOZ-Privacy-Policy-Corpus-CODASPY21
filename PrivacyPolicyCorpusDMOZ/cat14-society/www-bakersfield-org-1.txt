YOUR IP ADDRESS
For each visitor to the BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org site, BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org’s servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain name of visitors. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information but is used to gather broad demographic information. This information helps us tailor and improve your experience on the Web Site.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
General: Portions of BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org require visitors to provide personally identifiable information that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your consumer-buying habits. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
Surveys: We conduct periodic online surveys. For example, visitors to BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org may see a pop-up window asking them to voluntarily participate in a user survey.
Web site usage: We automatically collect IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit our site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their visits, their browser type and their operating systems.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED
BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org may use information collected from visitors in the following ways:
To improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used.
To award prizes in contests or promotions. Participation in some contests or promotions may require visitors to agree to be contacted by BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org or The Bakersfield Californian for commercial purposes, such as to subscribe to The Bakersfield Californian.
To provide advertisers or other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. Personally identifiable information is kept private and not distributed to third parties.
To send e-mail notifications about new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. This includes notification of changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use.
CHILDREN/DIRECT NOTICE TO PARENTS
BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org will not knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under 13 years of age without parental consent. Where appropriate, BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our site and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such submission.
Parental consent will be required in the event BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org provides a feature or event such as a contest or promotion that requires submission of information by children. Notice may be provided in a number of ways, including sending an e-mail message or notice by postal mail. At any time, you may write to us at webmaster@Bakersfield.com to request a summary of any information we have retained as part of such activities or to ask that it be deleted.
Parents should be aware that BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org’s Privacy Policy will govern our use of personal data, but that information which is voluntarily given by children (or others) in chat sessions, e-mail exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited mail. BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.
COOKIES
BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org or its affiliated sites may place a “cookie” on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of digital information that a web site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org site. BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org and its affiliates use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of features and advertisements, so that BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org can customize delivery of information specific to your interests without compromising privacy. For example, cookies may be used to ensure that you will not see the same ads too often in a single session. We also may use cookies to save your passwords so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit portions of our site.
REGISTRATION
Various areas of BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org require voluntary registration. Some areas require a visitor to submit information such as their ZIP code, age and gender. This information is not personally identifiable but allows us to better understand the makeup of our visitors. When you post content on BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org, we ask you to provide personally identifiable information that may include your name, e-mail address and unique identifiers. Unique identifiers are collected only for use as account numbers in our record system. We do not disclose any unique identifiers to any third parties. The information collected from these registration forms is used to improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used. Such information may be shared with third parties on an aggregate basis.
DEMOGRAPHIC AND PROFILE DATA
We also may collect demographic and profile data from you as part of the registration process (for example, your date of birth, address, ZIP code, gender and interest in certain topics). We may use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, displaying the content according to your preferences and informing you of upcoming events on our site. We also share certain demographic and profile data with advertisers and business partners on an aggregated basis. Registered users may voluntarily — and without requirement from BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org — make public in their user profiles personally identifiable information that includes their name, street address, e-mail address, phone numbers, birth date and instant-messaging handles. BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org assumes no liability for the misuse of a registered user’s voluntary release of personally identifiable information.
BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org will disclose account information only in special cases, such as (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org users or other persons or violating the Terms of Use of this site.

You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
This Privacy Policy may be revised over time as new features are added to BakersfieldCalifornianFoundation.org or as Internet security and privacy standards evolve. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
