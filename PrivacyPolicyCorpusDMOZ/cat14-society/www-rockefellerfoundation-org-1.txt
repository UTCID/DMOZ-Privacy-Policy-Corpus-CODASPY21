Skip to contentfacebooktwitterlinkedincopy url Grants/Grantmaking Policyfacebooktwitterlinkedincopy urlThe Rockefeller Foundation is committed to supporting a wide array of efforts across the globe to improve lives and the planet, and to promote equity and fairness. We magnify the consequence of these commitments through intense focus and a firm set of priorities. As a result, we do not accept or review unsolicited proposals for grants. The Foundation does this out of respect for your time as much as ours, since we are unable to give appropriate consideration to unsolicited proposals.  We ask that you not send proposals or letters of inquiry by mail or email unless requested to do so by a Foundation staff member. If your inquiry is related to a conference or The Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, please use the Bellagio application process.Our Grants Back to Top
