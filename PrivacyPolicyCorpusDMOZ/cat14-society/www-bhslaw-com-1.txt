In the past several years, businesses and employers from Amazon and Google to Dynacast and Simple Laboratories have been targeted in lawsuits under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).  BIPA was originally passed by the Illinois Legislature and signed into law in 2008.  After an initial series of class action lawsuits in 2015, a new series of suits has been filed in 2019.
BIPA defines “biometric identifier” to mean a “retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry.”  “Biometric information” is defined as “any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.”  740 ILCS 14/10.
A private entity in possession of biometric information or biometric identifiers must develop a written policy outlining a retention schedule and specific guidelines for the permanent destruction of biometric information/identifier.  740 ILCS 14/15(a).  Persons “aggrieved” under BIPA have claims against the offending party and extraordinary remedies for reckless or intentional violations of the Act.  740 ILCS 14/20.
The BIPA Practice Group at Brown, Hay & Stephens, LLP focuses on BIPA preparedness for businesses and a vigorous defense for defendants in lawsuits under BIPA.  Roland R. Cross, Lorilea Buerkett, Charles Y. Davis, David P. Hennessy, and William A. Davis are members of the practice group.
