Diocesan Policies & Procedures
The diocese, like all organisations, has a clear set of policies and procedures to guide its operations. Those relevant to the general public are available here.
We found 5 resourcesSynods Boards and CommitteesA huge amount of diocesan life and business takes place in meetings of representatives and volunteers, known as Synods, Boards and Committees. Here you will find an introduction to these groups and what they do.
DownloadData Privacy NoticeDownloadComplaints Policy (24)The Diocese of Truro recognises that from time to time complaints will arise. Our aim is to have a process that is simple to use and understand.
This policy and the procedures outlined here are applicable for complaints that relate to the way we have dealt with both safeguarding and other issues, however if you have a safeguarding concern or believe somebody’s wellbeing may be at risk, please consult the section entitled Safeguarding Concerns. Updated December 2019.
DownloadWhistle blowing Policy (23)The Diocese of Truro is committed to upholding the highest possible standards of integrity and recognises that clergy, lay staff and volunteers are often the first to become aware of, or identify, serious concerns. When such concerns arise, barriers to coming forward could exist in relation to misplaced loyalty to colleagues or the Church, or fear of harassment or victimisation.
