About Fremont Police-Command StaffOrganizational ChartPolice Campus Directions and ContactPolice Zone MapProgram & Staff DirectoryCalendar and EventsSpotlight and NewsFAQPrivacy and Accessibility Statement
Privacy Policy
It is the policy of the Fremont Police Department to comply with all federal, state and local laws when collecting, integrating, evaluating, analyzing and disseminating information related to investigations of possible or actual criminal activity.
The standards we adhere to are an effort to strike a proper balance between the needs of law enforcement to collect, apply and share information and the protection of citizens’ civil rights and right to privacy.
Nondiscrimination Notice
The Fremont Police Department adheres to the City of Fremont’s policies on accessibility and disabilities.
City of Fremont’s ADA Nondiscrimination Notice
Accessibility Policy
The Fremont Police Department is taking an active approach on meeting Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 794d) (“Section 508”)regulations for website accessibility.
We are working with our website vendor to review webpages for compliance with the technical requirements of Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
Our website has been designed with the following accessibility guidelines in mind:
The standard font used throughout the site has been chosen to be easily legible.
Wherever possible, we use live text instead of graphics to reduce the download time of pages and increase your control.
No information is exclusively conveyed using color. This doesn't mean that colors are not used to organize information; instead it means there are also other, non-color dependent ways of doing this.
All images and hyperlinks, where appropriate, have an alternative text attribute. This means when an image or hyperlink is conveying important information its content is described with an alternative text.
We have attempted specifically to comply with Section 508 referring to website accessibility standards.
Fremont Police Department policies and training materials are made available to the public via a third-party platform, PowerDMS at: https://powerdms.com/public/FremontPD/.
These files are available to the public as required pursuant to Senate Bill 978.
While the PowerDMS platform conforms to WCAG2.0, PDFs viewable and downloadable from PowerDMS do not automatically conform to WCAG2.0. We are taking an active approach to ensure all policies posted are compliant. Certain training materials were created for specific internal Police Department audience and, therefore, may not fully comply with WCAG 2.0 at this time. If you found certain files to be inaccessible, please contact Amy Gee at (510) 790-6967 or agee@fremont.gov for assistance.
Fremont PD is committed to making our services accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.
Please email our webmaster if you have questions or feedback regarding our website’s accessibility, or if you have difficulty accessing the site.
