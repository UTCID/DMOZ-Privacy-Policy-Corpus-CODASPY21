Struggling to pay your bills? You are not alone. Many people face financial difficulties at some point in their lives where they find themselves juggling payments and trying to keep the bill collector wolves at bay. Living with a chronic illness can make it even more difficult to pay your bills on time with added co-pays and stretches of disability. It can seem overwhelming at times no matter the cause, whether it be illness, job loss, divorce or just overspending. Hopefully, the information in this section will help you to take charge of the situation and try to minimize the stress on your health.
A lot of good information can be found here.
What Are Some Steps I Can Take to Better Manage My Finances?
Step 1: Create a budget AND STICK TO IT
Calculate total monthly income and expenses
Keep track of your spending
Comparison shop
Create a realistic budget you can meet
Step 2: Check your credit report annually
You are entitled to a free credit report every 12 months from each
credit reporting company and it’s important to see what it says.
Access your free reports here.
Get all three reports from Experian, Equifax and Trans Union
because they often show different information
Find and correct errors: Disputing Errors on Credit Reports
Learn about different types of credit and interest
rates
Step 3:
Minimize expenses
It sounds obvious but this is the
hardest part.
Distinguish between necessities and luxuries
Find expenses that can be reduced or removed
Try to avoid unnecessary purchases
Live with roommates
Eat out less
Choose less expensive phone and internet plans
Use a shopping list to reduce impulse buying
at the market
Try to build some savings – even a small
amount each month can add up
Only spend savings for REAL emergencies
This form
might help: Make a Budget Worksheet Form
Step 4: Insurance
Disability coverage - You may have insurance protection on things
like credit cards that would cover minimum payments on the amount owed in the
event of disability. Review your contracts for disability coverage.
Review and budget other insurance coverage, like car insurance and
shop around for the best rates.
Consequences of Not Paying
What can happen if I ignore my debts?
Depending on what you owe and own, the ramifications of ignoring debt can vary.
Eventually, a creditor can go to court to file a lawsuit and win a judgment against you.
The court judgment can be enforced in several ways.
A lien can be placed on any real property (such as a house or condo), certain kinds of valuable personal property can be taken and sold, your wages can be garnished, and bank accounts may be attached (including joint accounts).
If the creditor is a service provider, such as a utility or phone company, the services may be discontinued.
If a car payment is missed, the creditor can repossess the vehicle without a court order.
(See Car Repossessions) There can be serious consequences if child or spousal support payments are owed.
BUT you may be “judgment proof.” Judgment proof means that your property is “exempt” from private debt collection - it cannot be garnished, levied or seized or otherwise taken by your creditors to pay what you owe them.
See Section on Judgment Proof for more information.
Can a creditor take my property?
In many cases they cannot. Consumer debts (major credit cards, store cards, gas cards) are either
secured or unsecured:
Secured Debt – A creditor has the right to repossess or foreclose on specific property (called collateral)
without any court involvement if the secured debt is not paid on time. A car loan is a good example of this type of
debt. (See Car Repossessions for further information
Unsecured
Debt – A creditor does not have the right to foreclose or repossess specific property
when the debt is unsecured. Instead, the creditor must first obtain a court
judgment to seize any of your property. A judgment occurs when a creditor files a lawsuit against you and wins the case.
Impact on Credit Scores When you Don’t Pay Your Bills
Even if you are not sued or there are no active collection efforts taken against you, be aware that not paying your bills will result in a low credit score which can impact your ability to rent an apartment or secure a car loan in the future.
What Actions Can I Take?
What alternative actions can I take if I cannot pay my bills?
Negotiate a Work-Out
If you have some income or savings but are having a hard time
meeting your financial obligations, BE PROACTIVE and contact the creditor(s) and see if they will agree to an extended payment schedule or a reduced
interest rate. Successful
negotiations can prevent interruption of service such as phone or utility and
help prevent negative information on your credit report. If an agreement is reached, it is a good idea
to send a confirmation letter to the creditor that lays out the terms you
agreed to. But don’t let them strong arm
you – ONLY AGREE TO PAYMENTS YOU FEEL CONFIDENT YOU CAN MAKE.
If you need help with negotiations try a Nonprofit Credit
Counselor
Reputable agencies can help organize your bills, make a budget,
and set up payment plans if needed-
The National Foundation for Credit Counseling
Wait & See Option
If you have very limited income, including disability benefits,
and little or no assets, the “wait and see option” is one that people in your circumstances carefully consider. In other words, wait to see what, if any, action your creditors take. The reason this can be a popular option is simply because there is little, if anything, the creditor can collect from you.
If this is an option you are considering, it is good to know the following information.
Time-barred Debts – Statute of Limitations
The good news is that most debts do not last forever, but they can
be around for many years. Creditors have
a limited time to file a lawsuit against you which, in California, is generally
four years.
Federal & State Fair
Debt Collection Laws & Calif. Fair Debt Buying Practices Act
The other good news is that consumers are protected from creditor
harassment. For example, you have the legal
right to NOT receive phone calls or demand letters and there are actions you
can take to protect your wellbeing.
State of California Department of Justice Website- Debt Collectors
For more information See Illegal Bill Collection
Activities
Fair Credit Reporting Laws
The last bit of good news is that eventually negative information
will automatically fall of your credit report, which is generally seven
years.
A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
Sending “Judgment Proof" Letters
If you have no assets, cannot work or have low wages, and your
source of income is exempt from judgment enforcement actions (such as Social
Security disability and other government benefits), you may be judgment proof
and may want to write a “judgment proof” letter to the creditor(s). If you are judgment proof, it means your
income and assets are exempt from collection even if the creditor gets a court
order (judgment) against you.
Judgment Proof – Information and Sample Letter
Consequences – With the “Wait and See” and Judgment proof options it is
particularly important to understand there can be serious consequences to not
paying your bills when it comes to your credit score. Even late payments will show up on your
credit report and result in a low credit score.
Interest
rates – A low credit score can result in much higher interest rates on any credit
you are able to obtain including consumer credit cards and car loans.
Utilities -
Bad credit can impact your ability to sign up for utilities such as phone,
cable and electricity because your credit is checked during the application
process. In some cases, you may need to provide a deposit before you can
receive service. It could impact cell
phone service as well.
Housing –
Renting an apartment is where we have seen the biggest impact on our clients
who have low credit scores. Landlords conduct credit checks before renting property to their tenants. As you know,
Los Angeles is an expensive city to live in with very little affordable
housing. A low credit score can lead to
a demand for larger deposits or higher rental rates even if you are considered
at all. This can be doubly true if you
are trying to obtain a mortgage to purchase a house or condo.
Wage Garnishment and Claim of Exemption
Collection
efforts can look very different if you are working. If a creditor sues you and receives a judgment, if you don’t pay the money owed or try
to negotiate some type of payment plan with the creditor, they will likely file paperwork with the court to have a portion of your paycheck taken. This is called a “garnishment” and generally about 25% of your take-home pay will be withheld. Even if you are collecting Social Security Disability Benefits and working just part-time (below the allowed SSDI threshold), your earned income is vulnerable.

Even if you are collecting Social Security Disability Benefits and working just part-time (below the allowed SSDI threshold), your earned income is vulnerable.
However, if you can show that your earned income is very limited and is ONLY used for daily living expenses for you and your family, then you can file for a Claim of
Exemption. You will have to provide documentation to prove to the court that earnings are used for necessities (such as food and shelter) and not luxuries like cable TV.

If You Do Not Pay Your Judgement
What Can I Do About Harassing Phone Calls and Letters?
For many consumers facing delinquent debt, it is the creditor harassment that is the most stressful. The good news is that you ARE PROTECTED FROM CREDITOR HARRASSMENT - California law protects people from harassing phone calls and letters from creditors. For example, consumer creditors cannot pretend to represent law enforcement or other government agencies, call you early in the morning or use profane language.

Should I Consider Bankruptcy?
Some consumers
automatically think about filing for bankruptcy when they fall into
debtor/creditor problems. However, bankruptcy may not always be the best option for persons who are judgment proof
and/or have few assets and a diminishing income. Bankruptcy takes several months to complete
and costs hundreds of dollars to file the paperwork. If you
are a person living on disability benefits and are unlikely to return to work, you will want to think very carefully about the timing of a bankruptcy filing since
you can only file once every eight years and you should consider if you are
going to continue to accumulate debt.
Rather than filing for bankruptcy, if possible, consider consolidating your debt and
planning for your future needs. You can determine which services you want to maintain and therefore, which creditors
you should negotiate with for extended payment schedules or reduced interest
rates. Where appropriate, you may also send “judgment proof” letters to
creditors of services that you determine are unnecessary.
However,
declaring bankruptcy may be necessary if you have earned income or substantial
assets to protect or if your debt is so great that you really need a clean
slate to begin again. If this is your situation,
you should consult with a bankruptcy attorney to determine whether declaring
bankruptcy would be beneficial.
The AIDS Legal Service Project is here to help
if you need legal advice specific to your situation or need legal intervention.
If you are ready to complete the AIDS Legal Service
Project (“ALSP”) online intake form, click HERE. It
will be reviewed to see if you qualify for free legal services through the ALSP. If you are over income or have too many
assets, then the project might need to refer you to the Lawyer Referral
Service.
If you have any questions, you
can also email ALSPinfo@lacba.org or call (213) 833-6776.
