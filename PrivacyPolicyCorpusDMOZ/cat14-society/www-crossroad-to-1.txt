Privacy Policy
Only those who request
Scriptures
three times a week are placed on a list of email addresses. This list is private, kept in our computer
and not managed through a list-server. No one other than Andy
and
Berit will ever see it.
Concerning
book orders: your
addresses are never transferred to any list. We do not keep an email list of orders
nor any accounting book with addresses. We simply print out your letters, copy the
address onto your package and mail it. No record of your address is kept other than
in our annual stack of email letters archived in our garage for a couple of
years.
Those who write us and wish to see their comments
posted on this website will not be placed on any list. Nor will we post your email
addresses with your comments unless you specifically ask us to do so.
If you have any questions, please
Email us
