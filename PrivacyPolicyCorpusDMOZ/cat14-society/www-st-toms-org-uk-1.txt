The PCC works together with:the incumbent of the parish (that is, our vicar);the bishops of the Diocese of London; andthe London Diocesan Fund, which is responsible for the financial and administrative arrangements for the Diocese of London.As the Church is made up of all of these persons and organisations working together, we may need to share personal data we hold with them so that they can carry out their responsibilities to the Church and our community. The organisations referred to above are joint data controllers. This means we are all responsible to you for how we process your data.Each of the data controllers have their own tasks within the Church and a description of what data is processed and for what purpose is set out in this Privacy Notice. This Privacy Notice is sent to you by the PCC on our own behalf and on behalf of each of these data controllers. In the rest of this Privacy Notice, we use the word “we” to refer to each data controller, as appropriate.What data do the data controllers listed above process?They will process some or all of the following where necessary to perform their tasks:Names, titles, and aliases, photographs;Contact details such as telephone numbers, addresses, and email addresses;Where they are relevant to our mission, or where you provide them to us, we may processdemographic information such as gender, age, date of birth, marital status, nationality, education/work histories, academic/professional qualifications, hobbies, family composition, and dependants;Where you make donations or pay for activities such as use of a church hall,financial identifiers such as bank account numbers, payment card numbers, payment/transaction identifiers, policy numbers, and claim numbers;The data we process is likely to constitute sensitive personal data because, as a church, the fact that we process your data at all may be suggestive of your religious beliefs. Where you provide this information, we may also process other categories of sensitive personal data (as defined here by the ICO, https://goo.gl/rHo6Zt) where it is required by statute.How do we process your personal data?The data controllers will comply with their legal obligations to keep personal data up to date; to store and destroy it securely; to not collect or retain excessive amounts of data; to keep personal data secure, and to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access and disclosure and to ensure that appropriate technical measures are in place to protect personal data.We use your personal data for some or all of the following purposes:To enable us to meet all legal and statutory obligations (which include maintaining and publishing our electoral roll in accordance with the Church Representation Rules);To carry out comprehensive safeguarding procedures (including due diligence and complaints handling) in accordance with best safeguarding practice from time to time with the aim of ensuring that all children and adults-at-risk are provided with safe environments;To minister to you and provide you with pastoral and spiritual care (such as visiting you when you are gravely ill or bereaved) and to organise and perform ecclesiastical services for you, such as baptisms, confirmations, weddings and funerals;To deliver the Church’s mission to our community, and to carry out any other voluntary or charitable activities for the benefit of the public as provided for in the constitution and statutory framework of each data controller;To administer the parish, deanery, archdeaconry and diocesan membership records;To fundraise and promote the interests of the Church and charity;To maintain our own accounts and records;To process a donation that you have made (including Gift Aid information);To seek your views or comments;To notify you of changes to our services, events and role holders;To send you communications which you have requested and that may be of interest to you.

An example of this would be our safeguarding work to protect children and adults at risk.

For example, we are required by the Church Representation Rules to administer and publish the electoral roll, and under Canon Law to announce forthcoming weddings by means of the publication of banns.We may also process data if it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or to take steps to enter into a contract.
