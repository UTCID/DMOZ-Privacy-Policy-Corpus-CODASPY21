Welcome to The Net Church Huddersfield
The Net Church is part of the Church of England based in Huddersfield, UK, but with no geographical 'parish' and we don't own a building. We aim to help people deal with the realities of everyday life, exploring the big questions in a comfortable and relaxed environment.
You'd be very welcome to come along.
Most weeks, the Net Church meets at St Paul's Church Armitage Bridge at 4.30pm where we eat a simple meal together before our service, finishing at around 6.30pm. Occasionally we meet at other places so to be sure, check our rota our rota.

About Us
The Net Church is part of the Church of England based in Huddersfield. We are a 'network' church which means we do not operate through a parish like most Church of England churches, but aim to work through networks of relationships.
Groups
Along with the weekly meetings where the whole Church gets together, different people meet up during the week in smaller groups.
