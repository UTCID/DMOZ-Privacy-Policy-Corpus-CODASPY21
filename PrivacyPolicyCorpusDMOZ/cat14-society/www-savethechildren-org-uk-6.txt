Volunteer with us
Our incredible volunteers run 120 shops, organise 300 local fundraising branches, and put on cake sales and gala balls - join our amazing team and help build a better world.
Become a volunteer
Due to the changes in the COVID-19 (coronavirus) restrictions, some of our shops are currently closed to protect our volunteers, supporters and staff. We have also paused recruitment for some of our volunteer opportunities. If you can't find an opportunity near you, please check back in a week or two for the latest news.
Thank you for your support and we look forward to welcoming you as a volunteer very soon.
If you have any questions about an existing application or about volunteering, please email volunteersupport@savethechildren.org.uk.
