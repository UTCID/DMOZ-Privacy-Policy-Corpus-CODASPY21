PRIVACY POLICY
Thank you for visiting the FBI Employment Web site. Please review the following information to learn more about this site's privacy policy and system security:
Authority
The FBI investigates and assesses suitability and security issues of federal employment primarily under 5 U.S.C. §§ 3301 and 9101 and Executive Orders 10450 and 12968. The Director of the FBI exercises power and authority vested in the Attorney General to take final action on the employment, direction, and general administration of FBI personnel under 28 C.F.R. § 0.138. When the FBI requests your Social Security Account Number (SSAN) it does so under Executive Order 9397.
Privacy Act Notice
Principal Purposes and Routine Uses of Employment Application Forms
Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. §552a, we are providing the following information on the principal purposes and routine uses of information submitted on the FBI employment application forms.
The principal purpose of the forms is to collect information to determine the qualifications and suitability for FBI employment. Should you become an FBI employee, this information may be used to determine reassignments, reinstatements, transfers, or promotions. By law and regulation, we may evaluate your application to determine, for example, if you are entitled to Veterans' Preference, and if you are restricted by citizenship or residency requirements. We may also use your application to contact you for an interview and to verify your availability for employment as well as to collect information for an FBI background investigation to establish your eligibility for a required security clearance and for other authorized purposes within the Department of Justice.
Your Social Security Account Number or other identifiers are used to identify you throughout your federal career, from job application to retirement. We may use your SSAN to accurately identify your records should you apply for employment and to process your application for employment. We may also use your SSAN to seek information about you from employers, schools, banks, and other individuals who know you. In addition, your SSAN may be used to search for matches in other government files/databases (e.g., unpaid student loans, parent locators, etc.). Furthermore, all or part of your completed FBI application form may be disclosed outside the Department of Justice to the following:
Federal agencies requesting lists of individuals who are eligible for appointment, reassignment, reinstatement, transfer, or promotion
State or local government agencies under either the Intergovernmental Personnel Act or the President's Executive Program when you have expressed an interest in such employment
Federal agency investigators to determine suitability for federal employment
Selecting officials who are involved with the internal personnel management of federal agencies
Appropriate federal, state, local, foreign, or other public authorities conducting criminal, intelligence, or security background investigations
Federal, state, or local agencies creating other personnel records after you have been appointed to an agency position
Appropriate entities responsible for licensing or for investigating, prosecuting, or enforcing law, regulation, or contracts Federal, state, local, foreign, or other public authorities if there is a request for information on employment, security, contracting, or licensing determinations
The news media or general public when the disclosure of factual information would be in the public interest and could not reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy
Officials or employees of other federal agencies (including the White House) to assist in the performance of their duties
Non-FBI employees acting in furtherance of a Department of Justice function
Courts or adjudicative bodies when the FBI has an official interest in the proceedings
Authorized personnel pursuant to the routine uses most recently published in the Federal Register for the FBI's Central Records System (Justice/FBI-002), Bureau Personnel Management System (Justice/FBI-007) and Blanket Routine Uses (Justice/FBI-BRU)

Site Security
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, various steps are utilized to protect information, such as:
Firewalls - Firewalls block unauthorized access by individuals or networks and protect computer networks systems that interact with the Internet
SSL Technology - We require that a "secure session" first be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Currently, we are using 128-bit encryption during SSL sessions
Network Monitoring (Security, Intrusion, and Detection) - For site security purposes, and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, all network traffic is monitored in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage or conduct criminal activity. To protect the system from unauthorized use and to ensure that the system is functioning properly, individuals using this computer system are subject to having all of their activities monitored and recorded by personnel authorized to do so by the FBI (and such monitoring and recording will be conducted). Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, system personnel may provide the results of such monitoring to appropriate officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to this service, are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under applicable federal law
Technology Advances - As advances in technology arise, this site is updated with software, patches, and fixes to ensure site stability
Virus Protection - Computer virus protection detects and prevents computer viruses from entering the systems. Our virus definitions are updated daily to ensure site stability
This system uses a session cookie so the user can view open positions, and enter data into a form on the site in order to apply for open FBI positions.
