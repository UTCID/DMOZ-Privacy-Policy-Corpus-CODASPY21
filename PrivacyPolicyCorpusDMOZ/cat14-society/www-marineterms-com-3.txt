Anode corrosion efficiency
Ratio of actual to theoretical corrosion based on the total current flow calculated by Faraday
Anode effect
The effect produced by polarization of the anode in electrolysis. It is characterized by a sudden increase in voltage and a corresponding decrease in amperage due to the anode becoming virtually separated from the electrolyte by a gas film.
Anode efficiency
Current efficiency of the anode..
Anode film
(1) The portion of solution in immediate contact with the anode, especially if the concentration gradient is steep. (2) The outer layer of the anode itself.
Anodic cleaning
Electrolytic cleaning in which the work is the anode. Also called reverse-current cleaning.
Anodic coating
A film on a metal surface resulting from an electrolytic treatment at the anode..
Anodic inhibitor
A chemical substance or combination of substances that prevent or reduce the rate of the anodic or oxidation reaction by a physical, physico-chemical or chemical action.
Anodic polarization
The change in the initial anode potential resulting from current flow effects at or near the anode surface. Potential becomes mode noble (more positive) because of anodic polarization.
Anodic potential
An appreciable reduction in corrosion by making a metal an anode and maintaining this highly polarized condition with very little current flow.
Anodic protection
A technique to reduce corrosion of a metal surface under some conditions by passing sufficient to it to cause its electrode potential to enter and remain in the passive region; imposing an external electrical potential to protect a metal from corrosive at ...
Anodic reaction
Electrode reaction equivalent to a transfer of positive charge from the electronic to the ionic conductor. An anodic reaction is an oxidation process. An example common in corrosion is: Me -> Me(+n) + n(e-)
Anodizing
Forming a conversion coating on a metal surface by anodic oxidation; most frequently applied to aluminum.
Anolyte
The electrolyte adjacent to the anode in an electrolytic cell.
Anti-fouling
Intended to prevent fouling of under-water structures, such as the bottoms of ships; refers to the prevention of marine organism's attachment or growth on a submerged metal surface, generally through chemical toxicity caused by the composition of the meta ...
Antipitting agent
An addition agent for electroplating solutions to prevent the formation of pits or large pores in the electrodeposit.
Aqueous
Pertaining to water; an aqueous solution is made by using water as a solvent.
Artificial aging
Aging above room temperature. See also aging. Compare with natural aging..
Atmospheric corrosion
The gradual degradation or alteration of a material by contact with substances present in the atmosphere, such as oxygen. carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sulfur and chlorine compounds.
Austenite
A solid solution of one or more elements in face-centered cubic iron. Unless otherwise designated (such as nickel austenite), the solute is generally assumed to be carbon.
Austenitic
The name given to the face-centered cubic crystal structure (FCC) of ferrous metals. Ordinary iron and steel has this structure at elevated temperatures; also certain stainless steels (300 series) have this structure at room temperature.
