Privacy Policy
Mefco, and its
advertisers and
affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the
privacy of
Internet users. Below is information outlining our
continued
support for the responsible management of consumer
information.
Consumer
Information
During the process of
delivering
a joke to you, Mefco does not collect any personally
identifiable
information about you such as name,
address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Mefco
does
obtain some types of non-personally identifiable
information
such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect
to the
Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer
operating
system you use
(Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information
collected
by Mefco is used for the purpose of fine tuning our site
to match
our
audience, and to provide overall audience information to
our
advertisers.
Information You May
Voluntarily
Provide
In some cases you may
voluntarily
provide personal information to us. They may be in the
form of
an e-mail sent to us, or by entering
information into one of our response forms. In
particular we
may track and remember the source of a submitted joke,
along
with any
information you provided with the submission. In general
we keep
this information private.
We may choose to release
summaries
of the submitted information (such as breakdowns by sex
or age).
We may also choose to make some of the specific personal
information
public, but only in those cases where you have
specifically granted
us permission to do so. You grant us permission to make
personal
information public by using our joke submission form and
checking
the "Yes, you can list me on the contributors
page"
option.
In all cases, when you
submit
a joke to us, we may make the content of the joke public
without
making public any personal information
about you. By submitting a joke, you are granting us the
unlimited
right to use your joke in whatever fashion we see fit.
We reserve
the
right, at our sole discretion, to edit any joke
received, or
to refrain from publishing any joke.
