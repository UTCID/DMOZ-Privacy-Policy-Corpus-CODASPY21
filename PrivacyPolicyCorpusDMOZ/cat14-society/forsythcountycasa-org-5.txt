Thank you for helping us make sure each child feels special and loved!  Frequently children come to us having been removed from their home without the chance to take any personal belongings with them.  It is important to us at CASA that we are able to provide the child and the caregiver/foster parent the opportunity to buy new personal belongings to replace those left behind. Therefore, we always need gift cards on hand which are distributed on an "as needed" and emergency basis through our CASA volunteers who are working with the children. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this critical, but often overlooked, need.
We are currently in need of:
Gift cards in varying denominations from the following types of stores-
Walmart
Target
Amazon
Kohl's
any children's clothing store
We apologize in advance but we cannot accept donations of used clothing, toys, car seats or other used personal items.  Please consider taking these items you are interested in donating to The Place, Family Haven Thrift Store or No Longer Bound Thrift Store.
