We invite you attend McDermottTech 2020, a virtual conference exploring the latest global trends impacting the technology and outsourcing industry.
Please join us for this complimentary program on 29 September for the opportunity to hear the latest insight from speakers on topical issues around outsourcing, AI and RPA, European cloud initiatives and central bank digital currencies.
AGENDA
Central Bank Digital Currencies: Coming Soon to a Country Near You
2020 has been a year of excitement about central bank digital currencies, a potentially new form of fiat money adapted specifically for the virtual world that offers new possibilities for economic inclusion, monetary policy, and creativity spurred by programmable money.
Lee Schneider, General Counsel, Block.one
Jannah Patchay, Director, Regulatory & Market Structure Advisor, Markets Evolution
Shawn Helms, Partner, McDermott Will & Emeryy
Dealing with Disruptions of Outsourcing Services
COVID-19, Brexit, and the next disasters: How to allocate the resulting risks in the Outsourcing Agreement, alleviate their effects and achieve compensation for losses incurred.
Dr. Thomas Barnekow, Head of EMEA Sourcing Capability, ISG Germany
Dr. Ralf Weisser, Partner, McDermott Will & Emery
‘New Normal’ with AI and RPA
AI and RPA are, as expected, disrupting operations in client environments where implemented, and in mostly positive ways. They are unique from the technologies and service offerings of the past, and are changing (or should change) the way clients engage potential providers of these technologies, and related services. Further, they are changing the focal points during the procurement process and considerations for the rest of the client’s organization both during the term of the relationship with the provider and once the relationship is over.
Asser El Nahas, Director of Automation, Orange
Jason Krieser, Partner, McDermott Will & Emery
The Rise in Data Sovereignty and the Effect on the Cloud
Does the impact of the recent Schrems II decision and current European cloud initiatives such as GAIA-X create the perfect storm for moving cloud instances to European providers?
Data Sovereignty, or keeping data within national boundaries, is already well established in certain countries. In this context, this session will look at the current difficulty in using US based or US owned cloud providers for personal data as a result of the so called Schrems II decision by the CJEU. An option is to consider using EU cloud providers, and the European Commission sponsored GAIA-X: A Federated Infrastructure for Europe promises to be the new alternative to US and Chinese providers of cloud services.
