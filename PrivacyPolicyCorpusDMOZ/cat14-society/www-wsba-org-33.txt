Law Students
Updated: Sept. 9, 2020
Law StudentsMany people prepare for a career as a lawyer by earning a Juris Doctor (J.D.) at a law school. In Washington, they can also study to be a lawyer through the Law Clerk Program. In addition, there are two other licensed legal practice careers in Washington, Limited License Legal Technicians and Limited Practice Officers. The Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) serves law students by providing resources, and by administering the
Law Clerk Program and Rule 9 Licensed Legal Intern licensing.  WSBA also administers the Washington exams for all license types.
