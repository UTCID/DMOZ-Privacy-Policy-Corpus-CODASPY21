Security Information
BAP sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information. This is not considered to be a guarantee of protection of your information.

It is possible to disable the accepting of cookies by your web browser, however doing so may restrict your ability to access some web pages.
Some sites are access restricted. These sites may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest. Cookies may also be used for authentication purposes, and to improve security during a visitor's session online.
Cookies may store the following information: session (numbered key) and duration. A numbered key is a unique server generated number used to identify the current session. The session key can be linked back to a user's login identification.

Registration Forms
If personal information is collected via a website this will be done by sufficiently secure means. Where personal information is collected by local chapters, that information will be carefully used and stored.
