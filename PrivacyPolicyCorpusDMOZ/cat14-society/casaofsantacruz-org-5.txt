Imagine!
Sunday, September 20, 2020, 2:30- 3:30pm
Together we can change a child's story!
This year, Imagine! will be a free virtual event with a live-stream auction, online bidding, and stories from former foster youth and their CASAs.
In addition, we will be hosting a private Zoom meeting 30 minutes prior to the start of the live-stream. Tickets will be sold on a limited basis and will include wine glasses and a bottle of wine from a local winery to all that purchase tickets.

Team CASA at the Human Race
Team CASA
In order to do our part to help protect our community against the spread and transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), CASA has made the difficult decision not to participate in the Human Race this year. This is an event we have enjoyed participating in for the past six years. If you would like to make an online donation to support CASA please click on the image.
