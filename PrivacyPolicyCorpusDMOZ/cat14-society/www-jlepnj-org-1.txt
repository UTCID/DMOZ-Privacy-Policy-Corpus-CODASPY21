This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities and providing customer service to our donors, customers and prospective donors and customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special events we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you this information are developed and managed under our traditional standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our users’ personal information. If you provide your personal information to us, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire to receive or not to receive these offers.What Are Cookies?Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users’ browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our users.
