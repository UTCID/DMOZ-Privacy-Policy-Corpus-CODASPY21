How Secured Is Your Online Credit Transactions?
Your online security is important to us. That is why we are committed to
safeguarding your personal information to keep it secure and confidential.
When you order from our shopping center, your information is sent over the
Internet from your computer to ours using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
SSL encrypts your personal information before it leaves your computer, ensuring
that no one else can read it. Once you have signed in, you can check that
your session is secure in two ways:
Look for the letters "https://" at the beginning of the Web site address
or URL in your Web browser. The "s" means secure.
Look for the small padlock icon usually located in the lower right corner
of your Web browser window. A closed, or locked, padlock indicates a secure
connection.
If you have any concerns with sending sensitive information over the internet,
please call our customer service line at 1-323-349-0860, and we will take
your order over the telephone.
