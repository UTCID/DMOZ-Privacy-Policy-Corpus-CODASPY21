HIPPA Privacy Enforcement Suspended During COVID-19
Amidst the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is allowing healthcare providers to use technology that is non-HIPPA compliant.
HIPPA
is the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  HIPPA regulations protect patients from
having their private information disclosed by health care providers, or treated
in a manner that puts the information at risk of being disclosed.
On
Tuesday, March 17, 2020, the OCR announced, effective immediately, that it will
exercise its “enforcement discretion” by not imposing penalties against
healthcare providers for HIPAA-violations in certain telehealth circumstances.  Telehealth is the provision of medical
services via remote methods, such as telephone or videochat. OCR will not
impose penalties for HIPAA violations in the use of telehealth services, but only
when used in good faith for treatment or diagnostic purpose. The service does
not have to be directly related to COVID-19.
The healthcare provider may use a “non-public facing” (not available for
public access) remote communication product if they would like to use audio or
video communication technology.
Under the
OCR’s notice, popular videochat apps such as the following may be used for
telehealth, though they may violate HIPAA rules:
Apple
FaceTime,Facebook
Messenger Video Chat,Google
Hangouts video,Skype,
or Zoom
However,
healthcare providers may not use:
Facebook
LiveTwitchTikTokOr
similar video communication apps that are “public facing”
Notwithstanding
the relaxed rules, there are several vendors that represent they can provide healthcare
video communication products through a HIPPA-compliant business association
agreement. Some of these vendors are:
Skype
for Business/Microsoft TeamsUpdoxVSeeZoom
for HealthcareDoxy.meGoogle
G Suite Hangouts MeetCisco
Webex Meetings/Webex TeamsAmazon
ChimeGoToMeeting
Allowing
healthcare providers to continue to examine patients during the COVID-19 crisis,
while limiting the risks of in-person exposure is a noble goal.  The obvious negative is that many of third-party
communication apps, including those referenced by the OCR, pose privacy risks
to the patient.  For the vast majority of
us, the COVID-19 crisis will be over in due time.  But our personally-identifying information,
such as our names, addresses, and social security numbers, is a lot more difficult
to change.
In our
opinion, if a healthcare provider intends to utilize a non-HIPPA complaint communication
vendor or application, that should be disclosed to the patient and their
consent should be obtained – at a minimum. The patient should be informed prior
to consenting that using the service may put their private information at
risk.  The healthcare provider should
take reasonable steps, no matter what particular service is being used, to
enable available encryption and privacy protection settings, if available.  HIPAA-complaint vendors and technology should
be the clinician’s first choice.
