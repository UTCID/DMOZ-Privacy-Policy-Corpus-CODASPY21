"Keep going."
With these words, Harriet Tubman encouraged travelers on the Underground Railroad to continue their journeys toward freedom. The path was often dark and full of challenges, but together, they kept going, following the rivers and the North Star to the promise of a new life.
At Tubman today, people are still seeking freedom - freedom from violence, exploitation, addiction, trauma, fear. And as we work alongside them, we still say, "Keep going."
By joining the Keep Going Giving Circle with a monthly sustaining gift, you too are saying, "Keep going. I believe you, and I believe in you."
Each month, thousands of people receive crisis intervention, support services and education through Tubman. Your sustaining monthly gift drives ongoing programs such as…
Safety planning with adults and children who are in danger of violence
Weekly support groups so people don't feel alone
Community education to help teenagers learn how to live free of violence
Orders for Protection to keep families safe in their homes
Sheltering a family and providing basic necessities as they work toward goals
Monthly Gifts Make a Big Impact in an Affordable Way
Your monthly gift adds up to help more people receive services to heal from trauma
AND
It fits in your budget
A monthly gift makes you an ongoing partner in our work
AND
Together we can realize our vision of thriving individuals, healthy relationships and peaceful communities
To be a part of Tubman's Keep Going Giving Circle, simply select the "Donate Monthly" option when you make your contribution.
Thank you for your generous gift, and for joining us in saying "Keep going."
