Privacy Policy
Cookies and Web BeaconsSome of the advertisers on this website may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.
This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).Google's "interest-based advertising" allows advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser websites, and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). To develop interest categories, Google recognizes the types of web pages users visit throughout the Google content network.
As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, Google will add them to the "sports enthusiast" interest category. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences—or opt out of interest-based advertising—by accessing Google's Ads Preferences Manager. Google uses DoubleClick's DART cookie on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. You may opt out of DoubleClick's DART cookie by clicking here.You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.
However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.
This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.Log FilesAs with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.
The information in the log files include
your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
