The ChristianBookProposals.com website really simplified the proposal process.  The critique & edit service I used encouraged me every step of the way and only after a few months in the database, my proposal was picked up by a publisher!Dan Hochhalter, authorAfter three years of trying to get an agent, let alone a publisher to look at my manuscript, I gave this service a try. Within weeks I was contacted, and within months I was holding a contract. Let me encourage aspiring authors to don't give up!
