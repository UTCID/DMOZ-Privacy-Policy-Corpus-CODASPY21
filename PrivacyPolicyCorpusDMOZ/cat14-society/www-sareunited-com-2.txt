policy for SAReunited
The Internet is a fun place for work and for play. However, in order for you
to get the best possible use from our site it may be necessary, in some
circumstances, for you to give us personal information about yourself. This
policy tells you how we collect information from you, how we protect it and how
we use it. We want to help make the Internet a safe and fun experience for you,
your friends and your family.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact
SAReunited.

not accept the "remember password" setting when prompted by your browser's
software.
3. Web Server Logs
We collect IP addresses and web browser
information via Web Server Logs to analyse and predict trends on our web sites
(as do virtually all other web servers) to gather generalised demographic
information, and to administer the web site. The data collected is not linked to
personally identifiable information.
4. Online Forms
Any information submitted via forms on our web
sites is used exclusively by SAReunited for the purpose stated, unless otherwise
indicated on the page.

If anyone

all data secure against loss and unauthorised disclosure.
9. Competitions and Surveys
Participation in these events is
entirely voluntary and the user can choose what information they wish to

non-personally identifiable results being published on our web site.

11. Changes to this Policy
Any change to this policy will be highlighted on our web sites in the relevant sections to ensure that users are aware of the terms of use of the website.
If we make any changes to the way we use personal information, we will attempt to advise everyone concerned in the form of an email to their registered email address , to check the site’s terms and conditions for revisions.
There is 2000 character limit to prevent spamming.
Please cut down your message or send another if necessary.
