We are now a Church that is online and using our building.
Our Christmas 2020 Parish Magazine is now available online, as is our plan for Christmas services.
Our building is open 9am to 4pm, 7 days a week for private prayer (with the arrival of lockdown, and dark evenings, hours have been reduced); on Sundays from 10:30am in view of our service**.
Each Sunday, we now have a 9:30am Service, often a Parish Eucharist with Communion that is live streamed.  Now that the Government's lockdown is over, and Hertfordshire is in Tier 2 / High Alert in the new arrangement, we are awaiting updated guidance.  Our present intention is for the congregation to be welcomed back in church on Sunday, 13 December (next week's newsletter will set out the arrangement.  The service on Sunday 6 December will be without a congregation; the URL for following it as a live stream is https://youtu.be/7yRbUVmuh8k; more information in our calendar.
Find our online services - and other activity each week on our YouTube Channel or in our calendar.
Evening Prayer has been temporarily halted during lockdown; more information in our calendar (Morning Prayer coninues online).
Our Christmas 2020 written quiz is now available.

For food for thought we commend Bishop Alan's Golden Rules.
** As you enter you will see posters explaining the safe usage of the space. We have done what we can to minimise risks, please help us to do that by following the simple instructions. Use the provided hand sanitiser, keep social distancing rules, and if you sit in a pew then please turn over the sheet in that place to indicate where our cleaners should focus their efforts.  We've prepared a short video to set out what you can expect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhVtKTRaLDI.
