Description of Service
The Nixle services (the “Services”) are offered through this web site (the “Web Site”) by Nixle, (“we” or “us”).

The Services are intended to facilitate your ability to send and receive time-sensitive, geographically relevant messages (“Communications”) via one or more media.
Registration; Password and Access to the Service
The Services are available only to individuals over the age of 16. If you are not over the age of 16, you are not authorized to use the Services. When you register, you agree to provide us with accurate, complete information. It is your responsibility to inform us of any changes to such information. You will create a user id and password to access the Services. You are responsible for all use of the Services by anyone accessing the Services through your user id and password, and you will defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or expenses arising out of any such use of the Services. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account, you should notify us immediately. All information you provide to us as part of your registration is covered by our Privacy Policy. If we determine that any Individual User is under 16 we will deactivate that Individual User’s account and use commercially reasonable efforts to delete any information that we have stored about such Individual User.
Messaging
Messaging Charges
Message and data rates may apply.
Email Filters
We recommend that you add the “Nixle.com”domain to the list of domains approved to send you e-mail (commonly known as your “whitelist”). Please consult your email provider for instructions on how to do this.
Government, Location-Specific Communications.
Should you provide us with a mobile phone number for use in providing you with Communications, you authorize us to send you time-sensitive, public safety Communications and other government communications via SMS, email, or other similar protocol or technology based on your specific location at the time. If we receive a public health or safety alert that affects a specific location, we will attempt to send that communication to all Nixle-registered mobile phones in the area covered by that alert, as well as those Individual Users who have specifically registered to receive such Communications. You authorize us to do this. With the exception of messaging created by Nixle to raise donations for charitable non-profit organizations, Nixle agrees NOT to send any User any commercial messaging unless User DIRECTLY opts-in for such information either online at wordpress1.rs.c.nixle.com, or directly by SMS.
