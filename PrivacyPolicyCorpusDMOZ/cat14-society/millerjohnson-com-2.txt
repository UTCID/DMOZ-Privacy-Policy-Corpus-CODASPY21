Here are some examples of the kinds of topics typically addressed:
Hiring
Employee retention
Employment at-will
Dispute resolution procedures including arbitration
Racial and sexual harassment
Equal opportunity
Employee dignity
Safety and health
Family and Medical Leave Act
Rules of conduct
Employee discipline
Attendance
Lay-off and recall
Job transfers and promotions
Paid time off (e.g., vacation, holidays, sick pay, etc.)
