7. Children Under 13: The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) governs how information is gathered online and how it is used when communication is received from children under the age of 13. Although AIUSA is a non-commercial, non-profit organization and is not subject to COPPA, we take children’s privacy and safety very seriously. We do not request, seek or intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Certain features on the Sites require users to register and create an account, which involves the collection of personally identifiable information. A child under age 13 may accidentally provide personal information on one of these registration forms. If this should happen, and we are able to determine that the sender is under the age of 13, we will not disclose any of the child’s information to a third party. Should a parent discover that his/her child has submitted personally identifiable information on any Site, the parent may submit a written request within sixty (60) days to our webmaster, asking to have the information deleted or refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information.
8. Links: AIUSA Sites may contain links to other sites beyond our control, such as banner advertisements and links from advertisers, sponsors, organizations and content partners. You acknowledge that when you click on any of the aforementioned links, the sites you are taken to are not controlled by us, different terms of use and privacy policy may apply, and we are not responsible for such sites, including without limitation any content on such sites. Unless specifically stated on the AIUSA Site, we do not, directly or indirectly, imply any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked site. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any third parties. Your linking to any other off-site pages or other sites is at your own risk.
