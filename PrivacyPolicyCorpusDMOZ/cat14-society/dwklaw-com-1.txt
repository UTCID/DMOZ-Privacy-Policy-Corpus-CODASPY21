When my wife and I met with him, we never doubted his ability or drive. Dan was always professional, straight forward and took great care of us for the more than 14 years he represented me. He is a great attorney, but more importantly he is a great person and now friend. If you need an attorney, we highly recommend Dan to represent you and to be in your corner.” Jhon B.“Son injured at Disney World.
8 year old case resurrected at the 5th Court of Appeal.
Dellecker Wilson saw the validity of and value in the case and through another two and one half years realized a significant judgement for the injury sustained.
This firm is nothing but highly professional, dedicated, diligent, compassionate and beyond reproach. Kudos to our team led by Ken McKenna.
Doubtful there could be a smarter bunch of attorneys anywhere.” Dave P.“I was injured after being hit by a car while riding my bike and a good friend referred me to Tony Sos. I did not know where to begin the legal process, but Tony and his staff helped me navigate the road to recovery and settlement with honesty and integrity. Tony and his Paralegal, Joy, were always there when I had questions and kept me informed every step of the way. They helped me focus on my healing and recovery while they handled the legal issues of my case. I highly recommend Tony Sos and his staff!” Mary C.Contact InformationDELLECKER, WILSON, KING, MCKENNA, RUFFIER & SOS, LLP719 Vassar Street Orlando, FL, 32804Toll Free: 888-726-6735 Local: 407-244-3000 Facsimile: 407-244-3033 Office Hours: 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM Contact UsMap
