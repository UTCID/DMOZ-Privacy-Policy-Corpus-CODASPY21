Easy Giving
Helping our children is easier than you think! Here is a list of free and simple ways to raise money for the numerous programs at Children’s Wish Foundation. As always, we are grateful for your support.
Amazon
You shop. Amazon gives! AmazonSmile is a simple way for you to fund CWFI every time you shop, at no cost to you. Enjoy Amazon’s same wide selection of products, low prices, and convenient online shopping. AmazonSmile donates 0.5% of the price of eligible purchases to our programs.
On your first visit to AmazonSmile, select Children’s Wish Foundation International, Inc. as the charity to receive donations from your purchases.
DonateCarUSA.com
Donate your vehicle in support of Children’s Wish Foundation International and make a real difference in the life of a seriously ill child. Your car, truck, boat, or other vehicle provides the funding we need to continue our mission. With help from our partners at DonateCarUSA.com, the process is fast and easy. More than half of your vehicle’s value is donated to CWFI.
Free pick-up, running or not, at your convenience.
No paperwork, registration, or smog test hassles. We do it all.
Great tax deduction for the value of your vehicle.
No hidden costs to you.
