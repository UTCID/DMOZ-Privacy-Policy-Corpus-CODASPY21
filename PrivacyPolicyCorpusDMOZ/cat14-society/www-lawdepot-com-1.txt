Use of LawDepot® Material and LawDepot® Services

Final Document is defined as the finished legal document for legal document products or other document created through the use of a LawDepot® product. You are granted a License when you enter into a free
trial, have a subscription or pay for access to a product.
Any paid or Free Trial License granted is subject to the Terms and entitles you to:
use Final Documents of the products as specified by the Terms only.
make five electronic copies of each Final Document for your personal use.
make necessary mechanical copies (e.g. printed or photocopied) of the Final Documents for your personal records and as required for completion of the specific transactions for which the Final Documents are intended.
You may end a License in the manner specified on the order page, your account area or the help documentation. LawDepot® retains the right to cancel any sale or Site access at any time, in which case you will only be charged for the time the sale or Site access was in effect.
Your License is valid for the country of the document that you select when you purchase your License. You will be charged in the currency of that country.
If you are not a party in transactions in which a Final Document is used or if you obtained the Final Document under a free trial, you are not allowed to enter into new transactions using the Final Document starting one month after the expiry of the corresponding product access time period.
To access products, you must provide credit card details to LawDepot® as required by the Site.
LawDepot® will charge credit cards in accordance with displayed pricing in return for access to products and lawful services and if free trials are not canceled before the specified time period.
Payments made to LawDepot® are processed through either Sequiter Inc. or LawDepot LLC.
Subject to these Terms, if you are evaluating the Site strictly as a potential customer or to participate in our affiliate program, you are granted a license to evaluate the Site for that purpose only.
Legal Advice, Information and Decision Making Responsibility

The EULA document may be distributed on the internet without time limit by licensed LawDepot® customers as part of a materially
non-legal package adding significant value.
The rights granted under these Terms are granted to you only.

All guarantees are subject to any limitations specified in any LawDepot® Material. Guarantees are only available to customers who paid on the product before the guarantee is claimed and are not available on free promotions. For a guarantee to apply to a product, it must be explicitly promoted in LawDepot® Material for that product at the time of payment. A customer is only entitled to one Guarantee claim relating to one Guarantee category of one product. Should a customer accept a Guarantee related payment from LawDepot®, they waive their right to any additional claims against LawDepot® regarding any Guarantee unless otherwise agreed to in writing. LawDepot® has no obligation to refund one time purchases.
The following additional restrictions apply to the Guarantees payments for mistakes:
The mistake must be in the wording of the legal document and not in other text;
The customer was the first person to mention that mistake for that Guarantee category;
Guarantees only apply to LawDepot® mistakes, not to customer mistakes; and
We are only required to pay a customer once for a mistake no matter how many mistakes they may bring to our attention.

D. Other Guarantees and Refunds
Our maximum liability for any Quality Guarantees specified on the Site is $120 USD.

Client Privacy
You consent to LawDepot® using your personal information according to its Privacy Policy that can be found at Privacy Policy.
Terms and Headings
All of the Terms are valid regardless of the heading. To the maximum extent possible under law, the Terms take precedence over any conflicting LawDepot® Material should it be judicially found that the conflicting
LawDepot® Material is legally relevant to this Agreement under law.
Indemnification
Except where prohibited by law, you agree to indemnify and hold LawDepot®, its directors, officers and employees, harmless from any actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses including legal fees, asserted by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Site or LawDepot® Material or LawDepot® Services.
Governing Law
Except where prohibited by law, the Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada. Except where prohibited by law, you irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Edmonton Alberta, Canada.
Binding Arbitration
Subject to exceptions specified herein, if you and LawDepot® are unable to resolve any dispute by informal negotiations, then any resolution of this dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration.
A request for appointment of an arbitrator must be made in writing. Upon receipt of the written request, LawDepot® will have 90 days to choose and appoint an independent and impartial arbitrator. The arbitration will be held in the City of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
The cost of the binding arbitration proceedings and any proceeding in court to confirm or to vacate any arbitration award, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, will be borne by the unsuccessful party and will be determined and awarded by the arbitrator.
Exceptions to the use of binding arbitration are as follows:
LawDepot® may bring forth a lawsuit, without using binding arbitration, should the lawsuit involve intellectual property infringement or injunctive relief.
Also, either party may use small claims court.
Class Action Waiver
You will not seek to have the dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. Arbitration or any other proceeding to resolve any dispute, in any forum, will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Modification of the Terms
Except that you must be informed in a reasonable manner regarding any pricing increase, LawDepot® may, in its sole discretion, change these Terms at any time. Other terms and conditions are only valid when signed in writing by an authorized LawDepot® officer.
Severability
If any term, covenant, condition or provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, such provision is to be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and all other provisions will remain in full force and effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed replaced by a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable provision.
Waivers
No failure or delay, on the part of LawDepot®, in exercising any right or power under these Terms will operate as a waiver of such right or power.
Whole Agreement
Except as explicitly set forth in this agreement, these Terms, the pricing displayed on the Site, the Site's Disclaimer, and, if you are an affiliate, the Affiliate Program Terms and Conditions, constitute the whole agreement between you and Sequiter Inc. notwithstanding any:
LawDepot® Material other than this Agreement,
communication between you and LawDepot®, including telephone, email and online chat assistance, or
announcements, newsletters or promotional materials from LawDepot®.
