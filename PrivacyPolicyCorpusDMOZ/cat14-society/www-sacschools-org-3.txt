"Command them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share with others.  In this way, they will store up for themselves a treasure which will be a solid foundation for the future.  And then they will be able to win the life which is true life." 1 Timothy 6: 18-19
Through our School Funding Assessment, participating parishes contribute financial support to Nouvel Catholic Central Schools annually.   As part of our Stewardship Program, members of these parishes who establish a regular pattern of giving are eligible for Parishoner privileges, such as the participating Parishoner rate of tuition at Nouvel Catholic Central Schools.  In the absence of this regular pattern of giving, the Pastor may consider other factors on a confidential and individual basis.
The expectation of an active member of a participating parish is one who attends Mass regularly on Sundays, Holy Days of Obligation and regularly gives time, talent and treasure in support of our mission.  To qualify for the parishioner tuition rate, your completed Family Parish Commitment must be submitted with during registration.
