Refund Policy
To cancel your enrollment in a class or lecture, please call the Institute office (408-864-4060, Monday – Friday, 10AM – 6PM). Refunds or credits are available if requests are received at least 48 hours before the class or lecture is scheduled to begin.
The Institute for the Study of Western Civilization seeks to improve our collective understanding of how we in the twenty-first century came to be who we are; why we think the way we do; what assumptions about the world and human nature are traceable back to earlier periods in the five-thousand year story of Western Civilization.
