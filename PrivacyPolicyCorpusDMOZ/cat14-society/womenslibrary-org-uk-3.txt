Do you need help with words and numbers?Do you find it difficult to read?Are you wanting to progress in your career?Do you just want to improve your maths?We support women to understand, read and write words and numbers. Women sometimes want support with all areas of literacy and numeracy. Others need help with just one aspect, for example writing job application forms, being more confident about studying or writing their own diary. Most women who use the Project can manage words and numbers, but wish to build their confidence with these. It is up to you what you would like to learn and practice. You can get support in a group or one-to-one with a tutor, or both! It is up to you.How do I find out more?Please contact the ALN Development Worker, Donna Moore, who will arrange to meet with you to have a chat about what you need. This can be at the library or somewhere you feel more comfortable. After this meeting you will be allocated a tutor who will contact you and arrange a time that suits you for support with your literacy and numeracy.You can contact Donna by email at donna.moore@womenslibrary.org.uk, or by calling 0141 550 2267.How often will we meet and how long will I need to attend?Women usually met with their tutor once a week. This can continue for as long as you feel you need support. A review will take place every 6 weeks to check you still need support and that you are achieving the goals you set. The reviews also help you to decide when you have achieved all that you want and what you would like to do next.How much does the ALN service cost?It is FREE!What do I need to bring?You only need to bring yourself and a wish to learn more. We will even pay for your travel!Tutor FutureMargaret is my tutor, She helps and supports our future, Fun to be with! Gives a lot to us with her inspiration, Margaret is my tutor. You’ve given me my confidence back, With that, I have nothing to lack Because Margaret is my tutor. Self- belief is all that we need, Finding your way back, I’m in the lead! Nothing will stop me now, My feet are firmly on the ground. I’ve still got a long way to go But Margaret knows I can still grow!JMBrowse our BooksBrowse our Archive
