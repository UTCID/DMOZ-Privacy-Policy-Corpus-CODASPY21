Our legal basis for processing personal information
Our lawful basis for the purposes that we process personal information is consent, for the performance of a contract or for our legitimate interests.
The law allows us to collect and use personal data if it is necessary for our legitimate business interest and so long as its use is fair, balanced and does not unduly impact your rights. In many situations, the best approach for our members is to process personal data because of our legitimate interests, rather than consent.
We will ask for your consent to send you updates about our work via post, email, telephone, or text messages. You can withdraw consent for this at any time.
We may also share your personal information where we are compelled by law to do so.
We process employee personal information to meet our legal obligations as an employer.
