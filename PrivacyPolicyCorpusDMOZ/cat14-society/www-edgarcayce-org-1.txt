Glad Helpers Healing Prayer Group
Glad Helpers Healing Prayer Group
By Gladys Davis, Second Annual Congress, June 16, 1933
The Glad Helpers is a prayer group within the Norfolk Study Group No. 1, that is open to those who seek through it. I think the purpose is very well signified by the name - Glad Helpers. We are glad helpers. It is our purpose to help individuals, physically and mentally, by attempting through meditation to awaken the divine within each. We have been told through a reading by Mr. Cayce that the spiritual is the life, the mental is the builder, and the physical is the result. Therefore, no healing of any nature, mental or physical, can take place without an awakening of the inner or spiritual self.
We have three periods of meditation each day, and we ask all to join us who have the desire to aid in bringing peace, harmony, light and immortality to others, through the raising of the Christ Consciousness within and projecting it to others. We believe that Jesus, the Christ, has shown the perfect Way, He has laid the foundation, He has reached perfection; but we must raise ourselves and overcome the carnal forces even as He, in order to reach the perfection towards which we should all be striving. We believe He taught that every in harmony, every suffering, is a result of disobedience to divine laws; not a punishment direct from God, but a natural result of our own acts. Earthly parents might try very hard to impress upon their child that it must not do a certain thing or it will suffer thereby. But if the child goes ahead anyway, then it must suffer the consequences. The parents can help, but the child must learn the lesson. Jesus, the Christ, through having overcome, has made the way easy. He has blazed the trail. We only have to tune in to His Consciousness to be free from all earthly woes. No matter how straight and narrow the path, we can hew to it with His help.
So, it is our purpose to try, through meditation - and also through our thoughts, words and acts day by day - to break down those barriers which have been builded between the material and spiritual, and project into those vacant places the love, peace and understanding that may cause perfect harmony.
The higher we are able to raise the Christ Consciousness within us, the more we are able to project it outward and direct it to certain individuals who are seeking. If those individuals are in attune at the time, they catch it immediately. If not, there may be a delay in their receiving it, but the good is not lost. It goes out into the ether, and adds to the constructive influences that are building towards perfect harmony and peace.
The following illustration may explain just what takes place in healing. As a reading has said*, it is not the only way that individuals find attunement, but it is a good illustration: [*See 281-8, A-24-25.]
The bodies whom we hold in meditation are as musical instruments, some very finely attuned and others almost entirely lacking in harmony. The desire on the part of the one seeking aid creates the attunement of the instrument so that the player (the entity) may begin. The letters in each individual's name may represent the notes of music that must be learned by the player. We ( the Glad Helpers) represent the teachers of music. When the teachers and the players are able to cooperate in bringing the greatest harmony from the notes given them, then the Master Musician of the music of harmony reigns throughout. [used in 8/33 A.R.E. Bulletin.]
