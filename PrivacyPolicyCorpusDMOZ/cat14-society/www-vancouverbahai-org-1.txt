ABOUT THE BAHÁ'ÍS OF VANCOUVER
The Bahá’ís of Vancouver come from all backgrounds and walks of life. We are united by the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith: that there is one God, one human race, and one evolving religion. Bahá’ís see humanity as a single people who live in a shared world and a one common destiny; “the earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.”
