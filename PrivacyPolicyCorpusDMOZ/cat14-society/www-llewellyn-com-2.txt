About Llewellyn
This Cookies Policy relates to our website at www.llewellyn.com content and services (collectively, the "Service").
This Cookies Policy explains how we, Llewellyn Worldwide Ltd., use cookies on the Service, and forms part of our Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you consent to such use in accordance with this Cookies Policy.
About cookies
Cookies are widely used to allow online and mobile sites to function efficiently. A "cookie" is a small text file that (depending on your browser settings) is deposited on your computer, mobile phone, tablet or other smart device when you visit a site. The cookie may be sent back to that site when you visit again and may then be used by the server to identify and track your use of the site.
Cookies last for various durations. A "session cookie" is a temporary cookie that only remains in the cookie file of your browser until you leave a site. A "persistent" cookie is a long-term cookie that will be stored by your browser until its set expiry date (unless you delete it before the expiry date).
There are four widely recognized categories of cookie by function:
Essential cookies. These are necessary for the operation of a site (or part of a site), e.g. enabling a user to log into secure areas of a site or to use a shopping cart.
Functional cookies. These recognize you when you return to a site, allowing content to be personalized and preferences to be set.
Analytical cookies. These monitor site performance and analyses site traffic, gathering anonymous data.
Targeting cookies. These record your browsing history (such as visits to sites, pages visited and links followed) and use that information to make content and/or advertising displayed on a site more relevant to your interests. That process is often called "online behavioral advertising" (or "OBA" for short).
In this Cookies Policy, where the context allows, references to "cookies" include any tools that collect information from your device about your browsing activity.
How we use cookies
In general, we use certain types of cookies:
to identify you as you use the Service (essential and functional cookies);
(where applicable) to help us authenticate you as a Member and/or Registered User and to give you access to your user profile (functional cookies);
to customize and personalize your experience of the Service (functional cookies); and
to compile anonymous statistics about the use of the Service (analytical cookies).
These cookies do not contain any information that, in itself, personally identifies you and do not provide us with access to the rest of your device. We may, however, associate the information contained in cookies with personal information that you have provided to us separately.
More particularly, here is a list of the main cookies that we use on the Service, and what each is used for.

Cookies starting with "_omapp"
These are cookies set by OptinMonster (see their
privacy policy). We use OptinMonster to
provide notifications regarding our email lists and our sale information to our website visitors.
We may introduce further types of cookies from time to time to improve your experience of the Service. If we do so, we shall update the list above to note any further main cookies used on the Service.
If you require any further information on the cookies that we use, you can contact us as described on our Contact Us page.
Third-party Cookies
Google Analytics
The Service also uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Service. The information generated by Google's cookies about your use of the Service (including your IP address) is anonymous and will be sent to Google and held on Google's servers in the USA in accordance with Google's privacy policy (available at https://policies.google.com/privacy/update?hl=en&gl=us). Please note that Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
OptinMonster
We also use a third-party service, OptinMonster, to collect email information.
This service creates cookies starting with "_omapp" to determine whether you are a new person visiting our site
or are a returning visitor.
This helps prevent pop-ups from appearing when they shouldn't.
OptinMonster also complies with any and all regulations designed to protect user data.
You can view their privacy policy at
https://optinmonster.com/privacy/.
Rejecting and deleting cookies
If you object to the use of cookies on the Service, most browsers can be configured to alert you to their use or to enable you to reject browser-based cookies. Third parties may use certain special types of cookies (such as flash cookies) that cannot be disabled by configuring browsers, although other methods of preventing or managing such cookies may be available to you (such as via the relevant third-party settings panel). You can also delete cookies already stored on your device.
To learn how to reject or delete cookies, we recommend that you consult the "Help" function of your internet browser or, for a mobile phone, your handset manual. Further information on rejection and deletion of cookies is provided on www.aboutcookies.org.
If, however, you decide to disable or delete any cookies, some parts or features of the Service (especially interactive features) may not work properly. For some parts of the Service, we may require you to uninstall or cease using the relevant applications, rather than have a poor experience from disabling cookies. Disabling or deleting cookies may also affect your ability to use other online or mobile sites.
How to contact us
If you have any questions on this Cookies Policy, or our use of cookies, please contact us using any of the methods explained on our Contact Us page.
Changes to this Cookies Policy
We may at any time update or otherwise modify this Cookies Policy. We will notify you of any changes to our Cookies Policy by posting the modified Cookies Policy on the Service. By then continuing to use the Service, you will be bound by the modified Cookies Policy.
