What personal data we collect and why we collect it
Comments
Only members of the Congregation can leave comments for they are the only ones who have access to the private part of the website. When they leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
Contact forms
Data that you enter in the contact forms goes to the email of the Congregation but the email of the sender is kept hidden unless responded. All mails goes to spam so every 30 days the data you entered in the forms are deleted. You may ask for the deletion of your message even if the 30 days is not yet over.

Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
