California Privacy Law
For California Residents Only
This section of our online privacy notice applies solely to visitors and users who reside in the State of California. The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes those CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
The categories of personal information that we collect from you can be found in the “What Information We Collect” section of our Online Privacy Notice, which you can access by clicking here.
The business or commercial purpose for which we used the categories of personal information we collect can be found in the “How We Use Information” section of our Online Privacy Notice, which you can access by clicking here.
Your California Rights under CCPA
Right to Know
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (“Right to Know”). You have the Right to Know (i) the categories of personal information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you; (iii) our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information; (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information; (v) the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
Right to Delete
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (“Right to Delete”). Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us to: (i) complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; (ii)  detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; (iii) debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; (iv) exercise free speech, ensure the right of another party to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law; (v) enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us; (vi)  comply with a legal obligation; or (vii) make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Your Rights
To exercise your Right to Know or Right to Delete, please submit a verifiable request to us by either calling us at 1-866-467-8688 (1-866-IOPTOUT); or by sending an email to CCPArequests@mosessinger.com.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. The verifiable request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We may need to contact you to request additional information in order to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or that you are an authorized representative. We will not use any information provided as part of a request, including any contact information you provide or that we request in order to respond to or verify a request, for any purpose other than to respond to or verify your request.
We will make an effort to respond to your verifiable request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing either by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period before our receipt of the verifiable request.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights by (i) denying you goods or services; (ii) charging you a different price or rates for goods or services; or (iii) providing you a different level of quality of goods or service.
For additional information regarding your rights under the CCPA, or how to exercise them, you may contact us at CCPArequests@mosessinger.com.
