Hacker Claims to Have Accessed 12 Million Apple IDs Stored on FBI Agent's Laptop
Via CNET:
In all, AntiSec claims to have obtained more than 12 million
UDIDs, including user names, addresses, and notification tokens from a
laptop used by an FBI agent.
Even though it says it has more than 12 million UDIDs, AntiSec
says it settled on posting only 1 million, trimming out personal
information such as full names, cell numbers, and addresses.
Assuming this is true, why did an FBI Agent have personal information on 12 million Apple devices stored on a laptop?

New York Limits Robocalls, Requires Telemarketers to Register
Via Proskauer:
New York will be the latest of many states to require all telemarketers doing business in the state to register with the state.
The new legislation also prohibits “robocalls” (i.e.,
prerecorded messages) unless the recipient has expressly consented in
writing to receive them. The agreement with the recipient must (a) must
include a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the purpose of the
agreement is to make telemarketing sales calls, (b) not be required as a
condition of purchasing any good or service, (c) evidence the
recipient’s willingness to receive calls made by or on behalf of a
specific seller, and (d) include the customer’s telephone number and
signature.
