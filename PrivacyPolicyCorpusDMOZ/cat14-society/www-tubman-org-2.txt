Safety PlanningTubman’s trained advocates can help you develop a personalized safety plan. A safety plan is designed to help you avoid dangerous situations and know what to do when you are in a dangerous situation. If you need help, call our 24-hour crisis line at 612.825.0000, but if you are in immediate danger always call 911.
Below are some ways that you can be prepared for an explosive incident:
Know your exits. If an argument seems unavoidable, try to have it in a room or area with an easy exit. Avoid getting trapped in a bathroom, kitchen, or anywhere near weapons.
Practice escapes. Practice how to get out of your home safely. Identify which doors, windows, elevator, or stairwell would be best.
Be ready to go. In order to leave quickly, have a packed bag ready and keep it in a hidden but easy-to-get-to place.
Use codes. Choose a code word to use with your children, family, friends, and neighbors when you need them to call the police.
Know where you are going. Plan and decide where you will go if you must leave home, even if you don’t think you will need to. A shelter may be an option.
Use your own instincts. If the situation feels dangerous, consider calling the police. You have the right to protect yourself until you are out of danger.
Think ahead. Open a savings account in your own name, and start to increase your financial independence. Leave money, an extra set of keys, copies of important documents, and extra clothes with someone you trust.
