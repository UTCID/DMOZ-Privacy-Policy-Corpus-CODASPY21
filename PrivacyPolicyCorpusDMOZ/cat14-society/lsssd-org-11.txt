Volunteer Opportunities
Volunteer OpportunitiesVolunteers make a difference in the lives of individuals served by LSS of South Dakota. LSS could not provide the ministry we do without the time and talents of so many. From office volunteers stuffing envelopes, to mentors in the schools being a positive role model to a child - every minute and every ounce of love given is a gift. Many programs and areas of LSS need volunteers.
For more information and to contact program staff directly, click on the program area below. If you you'd like to discuss how your skills could help LSS through volunteering your time, please contact a development officer below.
