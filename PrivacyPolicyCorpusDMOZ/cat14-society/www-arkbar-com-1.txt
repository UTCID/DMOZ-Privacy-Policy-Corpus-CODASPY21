Discussion Group Rules, Etiquette and Privacy Policy
Thank you for being part of our community. To ensure the best possible experience for all members, we have established some basic guidelines for participation.
By joining and using this community, you agree that you have read and will follow these rules and guidelines. This is a great medium with which to solicit the advice of your peers, benefit from their experience, and participate in an ongoing conversation. If you have questions, contact Michele Glasgow.
Please take a moment to acquaint yourself with these important guidelines. If you have questions, contact the member services department. In order to preserve a climate that encourages both civil and fruitful dialogue, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate membership in this community for anyone who violate these rules.
The Rules
Do not challenge or attack others. The discussions and comments are meant to stimulate conversation not to create contention. Let others have their say, just as you may.
Do not post commercial messages on any discussion list, resource library entry, or other area where others might see it. Do not post messages intended to solicit for religious, charitable, commercial or political purposes. Commercial messages include notifications of CLE events offered by any entity aside from the Arkansas Bar Association.  Political purposes include supporting, endorsing or opposing any candidate for political office or for any position within the Arkansas Bar Association. Contact people directly with product and service information if you believe it would help them.
All defamatory, abusive, profane, threatening, offensive, or illegal materials are strictly prohibited. Do not post anything that you would not want the world to see or that you would not want anyone to know came from you.  The Arkansas Bar Association cannot be sure that your post will not be forwarded or printed and shared with others.
No posts shall be made in an attempt to gather support for or against any bill or proposed legislative initiative, whether actually pending or not, aside from legislation which is approved as part of the Arkansas Bar Association Legislative Package.  However, posts regarding feedback requests on propose bills from the Arkansas Bar Association Legislation Committee will be permitted.  Listserv posts are not the official position of the Arkansas Bar Association.
Please note carefully all items listed in the disclaimer and legal rules below, particularly regarding the copyright ownership of information posted.
Remember that other participants have the right to reproduce postings to this site unless you specify otherwise.
Post your message or documents only to the most appropriate lists or libraries. Do not spam several lists or libraries with the same message.
All messages must add to the body of knowledge. We reserve the right to reject any message for any reason.
Discussion Group Etiquette
Include a signature tag on all messages. Include your name, affiliation, location.
State concisely and clearly the topic of your comments in the subject line. This allows members to respond more appropriately to your posting and makes it easier for members to search the archives by subject.
Include only the relevant portions of the original message in your reply. Delete any header information, and put your response before the original posting.
Only send a message to the entire list when it contains information that everyone can benefit from.
Send messages such as "thanks for the information" or "me, too" to individuals--not to the entire list. Do this by using the "Reply to Sender" link to the left of every message.
Do not send administrative messages, such as remove me from the list. Instead, use the web interface to change your settings or to remove yourself from a list. If you are changing e-mail addresses, you do not need to remove yourself from the list and rejoin under your new e-mail address. Simply change your settings.
Warn other list subscribers of lengthy messages either in the subject line or at the beginning of the message body with a line that says "Long Message."
