A guide to what our personal customers can and cannot send in the mail
If you're a business customer, please visit royalmail.com/prohibitedgoods/business for information on what you can and cannot send in the mail.
Are you posting safely?
To comply with national and international regulations governing the carriage of mail, and ensure that mail in transport does not present a danger to the general public, we restrict or prohibit certain items from our network.
We want to ensure the mail is safe for everyone. Many everyday items, such as aerosols, nail varnish and perfumes are considered dangerous goods under transport legislation. You are responsible for checking whether or not an item is prohibited or restricted.
If you're sending your item at the Post Office®, you may be asked at the counter what the contents of your parcel are to make sure the items are safe to post.
For a brief overview download our prohibitions and restrictions leaflet.
If you're posting items overseas other postal administrations may have different prohibitions, see our Country Guides.
In addition, a number of countries and international organisations, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, impose certain restrictions, also known as sanctions, on what you can send to certain individuals, organisations or countries.
If you send prohibited goods or restricted goods (and you do not comply with the relevant terms and conditions), we may deal with your items as we see fit, including but not limited to, disposing of the parcels concerned (in whole or in part). Please note consequential loss cover is not available when posting any restricted items.
The comprehensive A-Z list below gives you detailed information about the things you cannot post with us, or where restrictions are in place and covers all our UK mail and International mail services.
If you are not sure about the item you wish to post, please call Customer Services on 03457 740 740. Textphone users should call 0345 600 0606.
Products bearing consumer warning symbols ARE dangerous goods and are prohibited unless specifically permitted below.
Note 1: A product bearing only the corrosive marking (depicted bottom right above) is NOT classified as dangerous goods if the signal word and hazard statement ‘Danger - causes serious eye damage’ applies.
Note 2: Environmentally hazardous substances are prohibited for items which exceed 5 litres/5kg.
Please be aware there are changes due soon to the Offensive Weapons Act.  To find out more please visit legislation.gov.uk and gov.uk/search/news-and-communications and search for the Offensive Weapons Act.
