In-Home Support Services
In-Home Support ServicesCaregiving doesn’t have to be a one person job. You can get help with daily household tasks and time to take care of your own needs.
Missoula Aging Services offers In-Home Support Services in order to provide affordable homemaking, respite and personal care assistance for caregivers. These services and other supports are also available for individuals for their own benefit (find out more at Help with Daily Living).
A dedicated Personal Care Attendant will come into the home on a regular schedule and help with cleaning, preparing meals, and personal hygiene. This provides caregivers a break from their caregiving duties and makes caregiving more manageable and less overwhelming.
AvailabilityThis service is available for residents 60 or older living within Missoula city limits and cost is based on a sliding-fee scale.
How to sign upLet us know you’re interested: Call Missoula Aging Services at (406) 728-7682 for In-Home Support Services.
Meet to assess your needs: We will schedule a home visit and meet with you to learn more about your needs. We will also collect basic financial information that will help determine cost on a sliding scale.
Placement: We will match you with a Personal Care Attendant (PCA) and work with you to schedule regular shifts when the PCA will visit to provide in-home caregiving help. Shifts can be a minimal as 2 hours every other week, or more, based on need.
Have questions? Contact Lauren Crabtree at (406) 728-7682 or email Respite@missoulaagingservices.org.
