9.         DISCLAIMERS. THE SITES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Should applicable law not permit the foregoing exclusion of express or implied warranties, then NCWIT hereby grants the minimum express or implied warranty required by such applicable law. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from NCWIT, its employees, agents, suppliers or any other persons shall create any warranty, representation or guarantee not expressly stated in this section.   ADDITIONALLY, NEITHER NCWIT NOR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS WARRANT THAT ANY FUNCTIONS CONTAINED ON THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED,  THAT THE SITES, OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES THE SITES AVAILABLE, ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE SITE(S), OR MATERIALS, WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

The foregoing shall apply even if NCWIT was advised of the possibility of such damages.  If you become dissatisfied in any way with ANY SITE or its Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop your use of the SITE and its services. You hereby waive any and all claims against NCWIT and its agents, representatives and licensors arising out of your use of the SITE.  Because some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, these provisions may not apply to you. If any portion of this limitation on liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, THE TOTAL LIABILITY, IN THE AGGREGATE, OF NCWIT OR OUR AFFILIATES SHALL NOT EXCEED $100.00.
11.       CHILDREN UNDER 13.  These Sites are not intended for use by persons under the age of 13. If you are under 13, do not use our Sites.

NCWIT reserves the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of our Terms and Conditions and to take any action we deem appropriate including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties, and disclosing any information necessary to appropriate persons or entities relating to user profiles, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses and traffic information.
13.       Governing Law. These Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Colorado, excluding all conflict of laws rules. Except as provided in the Injunctive Relief section, any action related to or arising out of these Terms and Conditions will be filed only in Colorado courts. You consent to the jurisdiction of Colorado courts.
14.       SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision(s) of the Terms and Conditions is/are found unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision(s) will be considered severable from the remaining terms and conditions, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining Terms and Conditions provisions.
15.       MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS. This is the entire agreement between you and NCWIT relating to the subject matter it contains. This agreement may only be modified by our posting of changes to these Terms and Conditions, or by a writing signed by both parties. Updated versions of the Terms and Conditions will appear on the Sites and are effective immediately.
16.       ABILITY TO ACCEPT TERMS OF USE.

17.       Notice.   From time to time, NCWIT may revise these Terms.  To help you stay current of any changes, NCWIT notes the date these Terms was last updated above. Your use of any Site following the posting of any revised Terms of Use shall be deemed acceptance of the revised Terms.  NCWIT strongly recommends checking these Terms periodically.  If you disagree with the provisions of the Terms at any time, your sole remedy is to terminate your use of our Sites and inform us of such termination as described in the Terms. Continued use of any Site constitutes your agreement to the Terms as in effect.
18.        No Archive.   Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the functionality provided to you by the Sites and by NCWIT’s systems, networks and servers are not an archive and NCWIT shall have no liability to you or any other person for loss, damage, or destruction to your Content or any other information submitted to or via the Site.  You shall be solely responsible for (i) uploading your Content, (ii) preventing any loss or damage to your Content, and (iii) maintaining independent archival and backup copies of any Content
19.       CONTACT US. Any questions or concerns regarding these Terms and Conditions should be directed to info@ncwit.org.
20.       TERMINATION.  NCWIT may cancel, suspend or block your use of any Site without notice if there has been a violation of these Terms or our Privacy Policy.  Your right to use the Site will end once your Member Account is terminated, and any data you have stored on the Site, including Content and Materials, may be unavailable later, unless NCWIT is required to retain it by law.  You may terminate your Member Account at any time.  NCWIT is not responsible or liable for any records or information that is made unavailable to you as the result of your termination of your Member Account.  YOU AGREE THAT NCWIT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SITE, CONTENT OR MATERIALS.  Any limitations on liability that favor NCWIT will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason
21.       MISCELLANEOUS.  NCWIT’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.  If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect.  A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
