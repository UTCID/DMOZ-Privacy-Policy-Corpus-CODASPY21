The 1800 007 007 National Debt Helpline
The National Debt Helpline in the Northern Territory is managed by Somerville Community Services.  People calling the Helpline are able to speak directly with a Financial Counsellor who will provide free professional assistance regarding any financial issues of concern.
Financial Counsellors are also able to refer callers to their closest face-to-face Financial Counsellor as well as referring them on to other services as required, for example legal services, crisis food and accommodation services and health services.  The National Debt Helpline is a Territory wide service and operates from 8:30am to 4:30pm Monday to Friday.
