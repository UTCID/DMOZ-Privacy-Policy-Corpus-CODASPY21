Our Policies
Governance and policies
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is dedicated to building a Culture of Health that provides everyone in America a fair and just opportunity for health and well-being.
We are guided by a fundamental premise in all of our work: We act as good stewards of private resources, using them to advance the public’s interest with a focus on helping the most vulnerable. Communicating openly about our structure and governance is core to that premise. Below you will find documents that describe some of the Foundation's key policies and governing structures.
