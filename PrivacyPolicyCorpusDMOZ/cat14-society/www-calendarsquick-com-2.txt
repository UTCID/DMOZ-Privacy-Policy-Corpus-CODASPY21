Privacy Policy
CalendarsQuick's privacy policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use
information you decide to share.
CalendarsQuick uses cookies and other web technologies to enhance your online experience and
to learn about how you use CalendarsQuick to help us improve the quality of our services.
When you visit CalendarsQuick pages, we collect your browser type, IP address, date and time
accessed, and the referrer address of the web site from which you linked directly to
CalendarsQuick. This information is gathered for all CalendarsQuick visitors and is used to
help improve the CalendarsQuick site, analyze trends, and administer the site. In addition,
we store certain information from your browser using "cookies" as described in our
Cookie Policy.
A cookie is a piece of
data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session
ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.
These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. We use a persistent cookie that stores
a login code associated to your username (not your password) to make it easier for you to log in
when you come back to CalendarsQuick. You can choose to uncheck the "remember me" login
option, or remove this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable
this convenience feature.
We use Google Analytics which sets a cookie and collects anonymous traffic data so that we can better
understand how CalendarsQuick is used.
CalendarsQuick respects the "Do Not Track" setting in your
web browser, which when enabled will turn off Google Analytics data collection in this website.
When you register for CalendarsQuick we ask for information such as your name,
email address, and password.
Auxant Software does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other
people or non-affiliated companies.
When you link your Google Calendar account to CalendarsQuick, data from your Google Calendar account
is read-only for display on the calendars you download and on certain areas of the website.
Data from
Google Calendar is never modified or deleted by the service.
No user calendar data is shared
with any third parties.
Auxant Software may transfer any information in its possession if Auxant Software or
CalendarsQuick is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Auxant Software
will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different
privacy policy.
Auxant Software may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances,
such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Terms of Service.
We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service at any time.
If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the bottom of this page the policy's
last updated date.
You can direct questions and comments regarding our privacy policy through
our contact form.
