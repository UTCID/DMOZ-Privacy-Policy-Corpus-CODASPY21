ACLU of Illinois
Illinois Complaint Form
If your civil rights or civil liberties have been violated, the ACLU of Illinois wants to hear about it - we might be able to help.
PLEASE NOTE:The ACLU of Illinois solely takes cases where the incident occurred in the state of Illinois, or cases involving residents of Illinois. The organization is not a provider of general legal services; it only litigates cases where there has been a violation of a person’s civil rights, primarily by the government. We do not practice criminal law or generally take cases where rights have been violated by a private entity. The ACLU of Illinois cannot provide legal advice unless the organization has accepted your case. The receipt of and/or response to your inquiry does not indicate the acceptance of your case.
Please tell us by filling out the form below. We receive many requests for help, so please bear with us as we try to get to your request. We'll let you know whether we can give you legal assistance. If we can't, we'll try to find another organization that may be better equipped to help.
