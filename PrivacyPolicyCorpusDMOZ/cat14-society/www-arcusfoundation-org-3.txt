• To detect, investigate, and protect against any activities that may violate our policies or the law and to establish, defend against, or enforce any related claims
4. How We Share Personal Information
We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to any third parties.
We may share your Personal Information with our Service Providers that help us operate and provide services in connection with the Site.
We may use independent contractors or consultants to perform services for Arcus. These individuals and entities may have access to Personal Information only as needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any Personal Information collected from the Site.
We also reserve the right to disclose and use Personal Information and other information in special circumstances, including to enforce this Privacy Policy or any other part of our Terms, to comply with legal process or law enforcement, to address actual or suspected illegal activity, to protect our property or rights, to protect the rights and safety of anyone, or for other reasons we determine in good faith are necessary, appropriate, or required by law. If we ever merge with, are acquired by, or otherwise consolidate with another organization, Personal Information may be transferred along with our other assets.
5. Communications and Marketing
We may use your personal data and other information to provide you with information and updates about our work, events, activities, and/or campaigns which we consider may be of interest to you.
In some jurisdictions, such as EU member states, where such communications are direct marketing there are restrictions on how we can do this. Where we contact you with such marketing via email, we will do so where you have requested the same or where you have consented or where we are otherwise allowed to do so by the applicable data privacy law of the jurisdiction in which you are based.
You can always request not to receive communications from us so please let us know by email at contact@arcusfoundation.org. Alternately, you can opt out of receiving direct marketing emails from Arcus at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails.
6. Third-Party Websites
The Site contains links to third-party websites, including Arcus’s social media pages (“Third-Party Sites”). Third-Party Sites may collect information about you when you interact with them through those links. If you follow any link to a Third-Party Site, you should review those sites’ privacy policies to find out how they protect your privacy. We are not responsible for Third-Party Sites or their privacy practices.
7. The Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Information
In order to comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are required to rely on one or more lawful bases for the processing of your Personal Information. In accordance with the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Information, as set out above, the lawful basis for processing your Personal Information will typically be one of the following:
Where you have provided your consent for us to use your Personal Information in a certain way (for example, we may ask for your consent to email you with updates about our work, services and opportunities which we consider may be of interest to you).
Where necessary so that we can comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, where we are obliged to share your Personal Information with regulatory bodies which govern our work).
Where necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract.
Where there is a legitimate interest in us doing so. In brief, the GDPR allows us to collect and use your Personal Information if it is reasonably necessary to achieve our or others’ legitimate interests (as long as that processing is fair, balanced and does not unduly impact your rights). In broad terms, our “legitimate interests” means the running of Arcus as a non-profit organization committed to LGBTQ people and great apes. Where we use your Personal Information to achieve such legitimate interests, we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. We will not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, for example where use would be excessively intrusive in the circumstances (unless, for example, we are otherwise required to by law).
8. Your Rights with Respect to Personal Information
Persons located in the EU may have certain rights in relation to their Personal Information under the GDPR. Persons in other jurisdictions may also have certain rights in relation to their Personal Information. We will honor your requests to exercise the following rights to the extent possible and as required under the applicable law:
Right to rectification. If you believe our records of your Personal Information are inaccurate or out of date, you have the right to ask for those records to be corrected / updated. You can also ask us to check the Personal Information we hold about you to check whether it is accurate / up to date.
Right to withdraw consent. Where we rely on your consent to use your Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This includes the right to ask us to stop using your Personal Information for marketing purposes, or to unsubscribe from our email list at any time.
Right of access. You can write to us to ask for confirmation of what Personal Information we hold on you and to request a copy of that Personal Information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the Personal Information requested and, where reasonably required, we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your Personal Information subject to any exemptions which may apply.
Right to object. You have the right to object to processing where we are (i) processing your Personal Information in reliance on the lawful basis of legitimate interests (see section 6 above), (ii) using your Personal Information for direct marketing, or (iii) using your Personal Information for statistical purposes.
Right to erasure. You may request that we erase your personal data. We will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so. In many cases, we shall use limited Personal Information to suppress further communications with you, rather than delete it entirely, so that we can comply with your preferences.
Right to restrict. You have the right to ask for processing of your Personal Information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate use.
Right to data portability. To the extent required by the GDPR, where we are processing your Personal Information (that you have provided to us) either (i) by relying on your consent or (ii) because such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and in either case we are processing using automated means (i.e. with no human involvement), you may ask us to provide the Personal Information to you – or another service provider – in a commonly used machine-readable format.
Rights related to automated decision-making. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your Personal Information which produces legal effects on you or similarly significantly affects you, unless such a decision (i) is necessary to enter into / perform a contract between you and us / another organization; (ii) is authorized by the EU or an EU member state law to which Arcus is subject (as long as that law offers you sufficient protection); or (iii) is based on your explicit consent.
Right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For individuals based in the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority about how we use your Personal Information. A list of the data protection authorities in each member state, including their contact details, can be found here: http://ec/europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm. For further information, please contact us using the details below.
9. Data Retention
In general, we will keep your Personal Information for as long as it is required in connection with the purpose(s) for which was collected and/or processed, unless otherwise prescribed by law.
If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic Personal Information about you on our suppression list in order to comply with your request and avoid sending you unwanted communications in the future.
10. Security and Storage of Personal Information
We use reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information. All traffic on the Site is encrypted with an SSL Certificate, including transmission of Personal Information to the Site. Of course, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you provide your Personal Information at your own risk.
11. Location of Servers and Transfers of Personal Information
Your Personal Information will be accessed and processed in the USA. In addition, your Personal Information may be transferred outside the United States to our other offices or Service Providers with locations in other countries.
Certain countries have rules relating to the transfer of personal information across borders and require us to ensure that Personal Information remains protected according to appropriate standards (for example, EU member states under the GDPR).
If you are an individual based in the EU, please note that some countries outside the EU have a lower standard of protection for Personal Information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals.
If you have any questions about the transfer of your Personal Information, please contact us using the details below.
12. Your Choices Regarding Our Use of Your Personal Information
If you wish to review, update, correct, or remove the information we have for you, please email contact@arcusfoundation.org.
If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, you can also unsubscribe by clicking on the “unsubscribe” button in any email communication you receive from us.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. As there is not yet an industry-standard DNT protocol on how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from browsers at this time. However, you may refuse or delete cookies to prevent tracking activities.
13. Children
The Site is directed at an adult (i.e. 18 and over) audience and we do not knowingly collect information from or about children. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 may have provided Personal Information through the Site, please contact us at contact@arcusfoundation.org.
14. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes to our Policy, we will notify you. Arcus may update this Policy by posting a new version on this webpage.
