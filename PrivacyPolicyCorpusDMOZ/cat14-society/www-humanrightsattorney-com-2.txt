RefundsCase Evaluation Fees.  CANCELLATION/POSTPONEMENT POLICY: To cancel your case evaluation, you must do so more than 24 hours prior to your scheduled case evaluation to avoid being charged. This time slot is especially reserved for you. We allow one postponement with no charge if rescheduled more than 24 hours prior to your appointment.  Otherwise, there is no refund issue for any payment made for a case evaluation. Existing Clients:Legal Fees.  a. TERMINATION/CREDIT/REFUND policy.  The client may terminate the firm’s representation of client pursuant to the mutual agreed upon engagement at any time, without cause. Client will not be entitled to refund of legal fees received to that point for fees that have already been earned when client withdraws. Any unearned Legal Fees on retainer with HEATHER L. POOLE PC are refundable to the client once the client has notified HEATHER L. POOLE, PC in writing (with a wet-ink signature delivered via dated, paper request to HEATHER L. POOLE PC’s headquarters) that client wishes to terminate representation.   Client is not owed legal fees for work already earned by the “Attorney” (any practicing attorney acting on behalf of HEATHER L. POOLE, PC).  Fees “already earned” by the Attorney will be dictated by the hourly rate agreed upon in the engagement agreement by both parties and amount of time incurred on the case prior to termination.  The client understands and agrees that the firm also has the right and sometimes the obligation to terminate the engagement, on written notification to the client, if further representation interferes with the independent legal judgment of the Attorney, if the client is utilizing the Attorney’s services to commit an unlawful act, or if further representation otherwise is mandated pursuant to the Rules of Professional Conduct. b. Effect of Client’s Nonpayment (Breach): If Client selects the payment plan option, Client acknowledges that Attorney’s services are contingent upon client’s timely payments pursuant to this agreement. Client understands and agrees that Attorney has offered client a payment plan as a professional courtesy. Client agrees to make payments on time and Client further understands and agrees that Attorney shall not be bound to continue legal services if client fails to make timely payments. If client does not fulfill obligations as set forth in the engagement letter, then Firm has the option of withdrawing from representing client. If firm withdraws due to non payment, the Firm has no obligation to continue or renew representation of client. Attorney and the Client will use their best efforts in furthering the purposes of the engagement agreement. However, nothing in the engagement agreement or anything on this website or anything in Attorney’s statements to Client will be or should be construed in any shape or form to be a promise or guarantee about the legal outcome of Client’s matter. Attorney makes no such promises or guarantees, in accordance with Californialaw. If there is any disagreement or dispute between you and the firm concerning fees or any other claim relating to your matter which arises out of our representation ofyou, you and the firm hereby agree to submit such dispute to binding arbitration under Section 1280 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California relating to arbitration of contract disputes. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in such arbitration. Client and undersigned agree that this contract shall be governed and construed according to the law of California, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction in regard to matters arising from the Attorney/Client agreement. c. Conclusion of Legal Services: When Attorney’s services conclude, all unpaid chargesshall become immediately due and payable.
