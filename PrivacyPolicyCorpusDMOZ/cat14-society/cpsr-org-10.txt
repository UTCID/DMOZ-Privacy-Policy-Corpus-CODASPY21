Government: Fighting Terrorism vs. Civil Liberties & Privacy
Up one level
Patriot Act, (The USA Patriot Act)
Created on February 20, 2005.
Many sections of the Patriot Act are set to expire (sunset) in December of 2005.
The Bush administration is pushing Congress to renew these sections as Congress begins the debate. We must push for the genuine discussion that was missing in the original implementation of the act and restore the privacy and civil liberties that this act has eroded.
Secure Flight: Home Land Security Watch List
Created on February 14, 2005.
National Identity Schemes
Created on February 14, 2005.
Includes Biometrics, Radio Frequency Identification Tags, FAQ & link to resources.
