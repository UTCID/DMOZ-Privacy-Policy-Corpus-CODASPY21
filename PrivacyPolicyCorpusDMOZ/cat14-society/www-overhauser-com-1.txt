Privacy Policy
I. Privacy Policy
Overhauser Law Offices LLC (collectively, the “Firm,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our website (the “Website”), contacts for our clients and prospective clients, contacts for suppliers of goods and services to the Firm, candidates for employment or engagement, and any other individuals about whom the Firm obtains personal information (each, “you”). Please read the following statement, which sets out the principles governing the Firm’s use of personal information that we may obtain about you, to understand how the Firm collects, uses, and otherwise processes your personal information as well as the rights that you have in relation to our processing of that information (the “Privacy Policy”). In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information held by the Firm) enables you to be identified or recognized. With respect to California residents, references to “personal information” in this Privacy Policy mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). The Firm will not sell or disclose personally identifiable information about you to unaffiliated third parties except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
II. Collection of Information
Although you are not required to provide any personal information on the public areas of our website, you may choose to do so by completing certain contact or marketing forms. Should you do so, we may, for example, keep a record of your name, email address, and any other information you voluntarily provide to us.
Additionally, we may collect the following categories of personal information from you in the course of business, including through your use of the Website, when you contact or request information from us, when we provide services to you, or when we receive services from you. If you choose not to provide such information, you may not be permitted to access certain Firm Website features, content or services.

Job applicant data, such as identification data and contact information, resumé and other data provided by you or third parties (e.g. recruiters) on our website, online recruitment portal (where applicable) or offline in connection with job openings, which may be subject to additional local requirements.

Also, the Firm may place “cookies” on your computer to recognize you on return visits to enable the Firm to enhance your browsing experience, as well as to collect additional information about you. As further described below, you may adjust your browser settings or use other means to prevent cookies from being placed on your computer, but doing so may result in reduced functionality and a less personalized browsing experience.
We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information that we receive or obtain from other sources, such as from our staff or personnel, clients, professional advisers, partners, and agents of the Firm, third parties with whom we interact, and publicly available sources.
III. Use of Information

It may also be necessary for our legitimate interests to establish or maintain a relationship with you; it is also in your interest to receive a response from us when you contact us.
Sending relevant marketing messages and inviting you to events/seminars – We use identification data, contact details, cookie and device data, and mailing list data to communicate with you by way of email alerts and post to provide you with information about our events, seminars, or services that may be of interest to you.

Complying with legal or regulatory inquiries/requests – We use identification data, contact details, financial data, cookie and device data, and legal and regulatory compliance data (including for anti-money laundering or fraud detection purposes, statutory returns and fulfillment of the Firm’s ethical obligations). This is necessary for the purpose of complying with legal requirements that apply to the Firm.

If you are hired by the Firm, this data will be transferred to our employee record files for the purpose of your employment. This is necessary in order to take steps at the request of the job applicant in the context of recruitment prior to entering into a contract. In addition, job applicant data and legal and regulatory compliance data may be used as necessary to comply with legal, regulatory, and corporate governance requirements.

VIII. Cookies
Our website uses certain tags, log files, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies from third parties (collectively, “cookies”), of which you should be aware.
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that can be downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies enable us to analyze how the Firm Website is used and to monitor site performance, so we can create the best user experience. We may also use cookies to personalize language settings and to provide social media features.
In addition to the cookies used by the Firm and our service providers, some cookies are placed by third parties such as Google Analytics, as described below.
By using the Firm’s Website, you agree to the use of cookies for the following purposes:
Essential Cookies: these are essential in order to enable you to move around the Firm’s Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.
Performance and Analytics Cookies: Google Analytics (“Analytics”) is Google’s free web analytics tool that helps us understand how our visitors engage with our website. Analytics collects information anonymously and, much like examining footprints in sand, it reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Analytics uses its own set of cookies to track visitor interactions. These cookies are used to store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. A different set of cookies is used for each website, and visitors are not tracked across multiple sites. Analytics customers are obliged to notify users of their use of analytics software. To disable this type of cookie, some browsers will indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis. In addition to declining cookies, you can also install the Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on in your browser, which prevents Google Analytics from collecting information about your website visits. You can also opt out by clicking here.
Functionality Cookies: they remember the choices you make, such as language options or your current region. These cookies help to make your visit more personal and are deleted automatically when you close your browser or the session expires.
You can block or disable cookies on your device at any time by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. You can also delete the cookies that are stored on your device. However, blocking, disabling, or deleting cookies may limit your ability to view all the pages of the Firm Website or use online services that require registration. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting their Ad Settings page. You may also opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. You can find more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.com.
IX. Information Retention
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which that information was collected as set out in this Privacy Policy or for longer as required under any applicable legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements. Should you opt out or no longer wish to receive marketing messages from us, we will securely delete your personal information from the relevant mailing list(s).
X. Additional Services
From time to time, the Firm may offer additional services through the Firm Website. In some cases additional services may be subject to alternative terms of use (as identified by the Firm), and your use of any such services will constitute your acceptance of such alternative terms of use. Unless otherwise stated, such alternative terms of use shall apply to supplement this Agreement and in the context of any conflicting terms, this Agreement shall govern with respect to the Firm Website, content and services, excepting only those services which are expressly covered, and then only to the extent so expressly covered, by such alternative terms.
XI. Sending Information Does Not Form an Attorney-Client Relationship
Transmission of information from this Website does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and the Firm, nor is it intended to do so. The transmission of the Website, in part or in whole, and/or any communication with us via Internet e-mail through this site does not constitute or create an attorney-client relationship between us and any recipients.
XII. Unsubscribe
We may send you direct marketing messages including by way of email alerts and postal mail. If you no longer wish to receive our email alerts, to be part of a mailing list, or to receive any marketing communications, you can opt-out of such communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the relevant communication or contacting us at requestinfo@overhauser.com.
XIII. Notification of Changes
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy as our services and privacy practices change, or as required by applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Where it is practicable, we will notify you by email of any significant changes. However, the last update date is posted below, and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to be informed of how we use your personal information.
