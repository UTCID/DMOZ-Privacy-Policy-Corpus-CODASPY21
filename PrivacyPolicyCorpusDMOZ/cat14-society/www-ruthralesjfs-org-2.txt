Website Terms Of Use
Donor Privacy Policy
JFS PRIVACY POLICY
JFS respects the privacy of every individual who uses JFS owned websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, "Site"). This privacy policy applies to any collection or sharing of your information, including information collected on our Site. This policy was developed to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information will not be used in any manner inconsistent with JFS’ stated privacy, fiscal management & responsibility, and organizational objectives. JFS endeavors to utilize industry standard, reasonable, and commercially feasible precautions to protect your Personally Identifiable Information.Latest Version
JFS reserves the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will note the date of last update at the top or bottom of this Privacy Policy.  Also please reference the separate JFS Donor Privacy Policy
Data Collection
This Site may collect standard website traffic pattern information such as the visitor's IP address, page visits
and server usage statistics. We do not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. If you request information, initiate a contact form, make a donation, register for an event, call us, or write to us, we may collect the following information: name, address, telephone number, email address, subject of inquiry, or other information specified at the time of your inquiry. If we ask for credit card or billing information,(refer to "Security" section below) we will not store this information on JFS servers or systems.
Security
We take industry standard precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via our Site, your information is protected both online and offline. Whenever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data) on our Site, that information is encrypted and transmitted in a secure manner. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
We process your financial transactions securely using the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS") (the credit card industry's most stringent security standard). Examples of our security measures include: physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards; sophisticated security monitoring tools; use of strong encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) for transmissions of donation information to and from our credit card processor; restricted access of personally identifiable information; and periodic security audits.
In addition to protecting sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to Personally Identifiable Information. The computers/servers in which we store Personally Identifiable Information use industry standard security practices, and are kept in a secure limited-access environment. We do NOT store your credit card information on our servers.
Use & Disclosure of Information
We will not sell, trade, rent or share your Personally Identifiable Information, collected on the Site or through any other business activities, with anyone else, including any third parties, without your express permission. We will not send you mailings on behalf of other organizations without your prior request. We always provide you the opportunity to remove your name from our mailing and emailing lists, if you so choose. Send your opt-out request to info@ralesjfs.org
Demographic Information Sharing
We may collect aggregated demographic and website usage information from our Site. This is not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information that can identify any individual person. We may share this aggregated demographic and usage information with our partners and advertisers from time to time.
Cookies
We may use "cookies" on certain pages of this Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a website visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our Site and identify repeat visitors to our Site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of all our users as a group to enhance their experience on our Site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any Personally Identifiable Information on our Site. You may choose NOT to accept cookies on most browsers, by setting options for preventing, accepting, or receiving cookies. However, please be aware that if you block cookies, some website functionality may be lost.
