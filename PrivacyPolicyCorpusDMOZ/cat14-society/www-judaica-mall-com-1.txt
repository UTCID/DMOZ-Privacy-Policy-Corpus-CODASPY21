Privacy Policy
Privace Policy
Judaica Mall is firmly committed to your privacy. Our company takes all precautions and measures to ensure that your privacy is protected. Under no circumstances will we sell or trade your information to any third party.
Our site requires that our users give us contact information (such as name and e-mail address) when contacting us for service or questions, as well as when purchasing. The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary and to ship purchased items. Users may request not to receive future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section).
Our site uses an order form on a secure server (SSL) for customers to purchase products. We collect visitor contact information (such as name and e-mail address). Financial information (such as credit card numbers) is collected on a third party secure server. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers and to update customers of new services, specials, and products. Financial information that is collected is deleted from the secure server in a timely manner after the completion of the transaction for which it was used.
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as e-mail address and phone number). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below).
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as e-mail address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company.
SECURITYThis site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. Orders retrieved from the secure server are deleted after the completion of the transaction. Each order is processed manually using the same process we use for fax and telephone orders. Once the order is retrieved and your card verified, all portions of the order fulfillment process are handled internally.
CHOICE/OPT-OUTThis site gives users the following option for removing themselves from our mailing lists so they do not receive any communication from us by regular mail or e mail. Send e-mail to: info@judaica-mall.com with "remove" in the subject line.
