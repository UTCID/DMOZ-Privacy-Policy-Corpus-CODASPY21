privacy policy
A statement used on many Web sites to explain how a company protects the privacy of the information it aggregates about its users. It discloses how the site collects, uses, and shares your personal information. Here's an example: Whenever a Web site displays online ads by an ad network, the Web site is required to post a privacy policy stating that the Web site owner (the publisher) is not liable for what the third-party companies (the ad network or the advertiser) do with the information they gather from users who click on their ads.
