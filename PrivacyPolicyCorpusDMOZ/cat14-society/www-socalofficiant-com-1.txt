FOR A BEACH CEREMONY,  A THREE HUNDRED ($300) NON-REFUNDABLE REFFERAL FEE IS DUE FROM THE CLIENTS TO COMPANY AT TIME OF BOOKING. NO DATES WILL BE HELD UNTIL THE REFERRAL FEE IS PAID IN FULL. FOR ALL OTHER AMOUNTS DUE FROM CLIENTS TO COMPANY AND/OR OFFICIANT AS AGREED UPON AT TIME OF BOOKING, THE BALANCE ON SUCH AMOUNTS SHALL BE PAID TO COMPANY AND/OR OFFICIANT PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CEREMONY.  FOR THE BEACH CEREMONY, ANY REMAINING BALANCE DUE FROM THE CLIENTS TO COMPANY AND/OR OFFICIANT IS DUE FOUR (4) WEEKS PRIOR TO THE BEACH CEREMONY. IN THE EVENT CLIENTS PAY COMPANY ANY OFFICIANT FEE, COMPANY WILL FORWARD SUCH FEE TO OFFICIANT.
