State Constitution Language on Jury Nullification
Jurors in all courts in the United States have the right to vote their conscience without being punished for their verdicts. The Founders valued this feature of English common law, and purposely built it into our legal system. It is not explicitly spelled out in the United States Constitution, as many of our rights are not, but denial of this benefit of trial by jury in the colonies was one of the grievances that led to the American Revolution. Even though it was well understood and used in both pre- and post-revolutionary America, some states added explicitly codified guarantees of this right in their state constitutions. Former FIJA board member and attorney Tom Stahl discusses the additional protections that can be found in many state constitutions.
