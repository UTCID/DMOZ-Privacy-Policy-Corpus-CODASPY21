12. Order Acceptance and Billing
All billing information provided must be truthful and accurate.  Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information constitutes a breach of this Agreement and may result in order cancellation.  Prior to accepting an order we may also request additional information from you.  We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department.  If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge.  LifeWay may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card.  This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period.  Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held.  We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the item(s).
Subject to US law, LifeWay reserves the right to limit or refuse the purchase of goods or services (including registrations) for any reason. These restrictions may apply to orders placed by the same account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
13. Pricing Information
LifeWay cannot confirm the price of an item until after your order is placed.  Pricing errors may occur on LifeWay.com..  LifeWay reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from LifeWay.   Pricing for products may be different on LifeWay.com from prices available in LifeWay Christian Stores.
14. Promotional Codes
Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or discontinue with or without notice.  Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law.  Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise offered.  They are not redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason.
15. Gift Cards
The risk of loss and title to gift cards pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable.
16. Indemnity
User agrees to indemnify and hold LifeWay.com and its Related Parties harmless from and against, and to reimburse LifeWay.com and its Related Parties with respect to, any and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, judgments, settlements, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable related expenses, legal fees, and costs of investigation) of every nature whatsoever incurred by LifeWay.com or its Related Parties by reason of or arising out of or in connection with

18. General

No term or provision of this Agreement is deemed waived and no breach excused, unless the waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the party that is claimed to have waived or consented. Any consent by any party to, or waiver of, a breach by the other, whether expressed or implied, does not constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for, any other different or subsequent breach.
b. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee. LifeWay.com and User consent and agree that all legal proceedings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be maintained in courts sitting within the State of Tennessee, County of Davidson, and further agree that jurisdiction and venue for such proceedings shall lie exclusively with such courts.
c. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, all other provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect.
d. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all policies, guidelines, and amendments set out, from time to time, by LifeWay.com in this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous negotiations, proposals, commitments, writings, and understandings of any nature whatsoever, whether oral or written.

g. Remedies Cumulative. Unless otherwise set out in this Agreement, the rights and remedies granted to each party under this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to each party's rights provided by law or otherwise. Each party may exercise its rights concurrently or separately and the exercise of one remedy is not deemed an exclusive election of that remedy or preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
h. Counterparts or Electronic Acceptance. This Agreement may be executed by indicating assent through electronic means or may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed to be an original and all of which together are deemed to be one and the same instrument.
