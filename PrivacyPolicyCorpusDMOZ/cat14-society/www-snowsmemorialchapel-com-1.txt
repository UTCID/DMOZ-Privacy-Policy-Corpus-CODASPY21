About
Snow's Memorial Chapel on Cherry Street is a funeral home in the heart of downtown Macon, Georgia. Our funeral home is next door to the Historic Municipal Auditorium. To better serve families, we have 2 convenient locations in Macon and a close affiliation with Macon Memorial Park Funeral Home and Macon Memorial Park Cemetery. Our staff members are bilingual and able to serve both Spanish- and English-speaking families.
Elegant funeral home
At Snow’s Memorial Chapel, we offer a beautiful chapel at our Cherry Street location. The Waterford chandelier and mahogany pews add to the character of the beautiful setting that seats more than 225 guests. Our state-of-the-art sound and video equipment make it convenient to share memories and favorite songs.
Personalized services
We proudly offer celebrant-led services to families who want a personalized service. Our certified celebrant is an ordained minister, however celebrant services can be as traditional as a formal church service or contemporary and non-religious—and anywhere in between. In celebrant-led services focus is made on the life being honored and that person’s joys, accomplishments and legacy.
Commitment to community
At Snow's Memorial Chapel, we host annual Veteran’s Day and Memorial Day programs and are active in the Toys for Tots campaign, sponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps.
History
Located in downtown Macon, Snow’s Memorial Chapel began in 1892 as Burgard Funeral Furnishings. In 1942, William A. Snow, Jr. bought the funeral home for his brother-in-law, Everett Sammons, and changed the name to Memorial Chapel.
In 1959, Sammons’ nephew, William A. Snow III, began working at the funeral home, and in 1973, Everett Sammons passed away, William A. Snow III and his wife managed the business. Later in 1979, he purchased the funeral home from his father and changed the name to Snow’s Memorial Chapel. Both Mr. and Mrs. William A. Snow III are still active in the business today.
Reginald Smith, who began working with us in 1965, has a long-term heritage of serving in our funeral home. William A. Snow IV, who started in 1983, manages Snow’s Memorial Chapel on Cherry Street and is also the General Manager of the Macon Georgia Group.
Best of the Best 2020
Serving the local community with locations throughout Macon—and voted Best of the Best 2020 by readers of The Telegraph—we ensure you not only receive the compassionate care you expect from a locally operated establishment, but also the highest quality of care and value you deserve.
