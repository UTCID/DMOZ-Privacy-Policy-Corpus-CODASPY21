2. Definitions. The “Website” means any websites owned or operated by the Alliance for Strong Families and Communities and its affiliates, including FEI Behavioral Health, and Ways to Work (the “Alliance”), including, but not limited to, the websites operated at the domain names www.alliance1.org, www.feinet.com, and www.waystowork.org.
3. Use of the Site. The Alliance operates the Websites to provide member services, library and data repositories, educational services and information relevant to users of our Websites or members of the Alliance. Any new features added to the Websites will also be subject to these Terms of Use.
4. Member Account, Password and Security. If you create an account on the Websites or become a member of the Alliance on the Websites, you will receive a password and account designation upon completing the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to: (a) provide true, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration or profile form (your “Registration Data”); (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, current and complete; (c) immediately notify the Alliance of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security; and (d) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. The Alliance has the right to suspend or terminate your account for any reason, including for violations of this or any other agreement with the Alliance. Any Personal Data in your Registration Data will be collected, used and disclosed as provided in our Privacy Policy.
5. Site Content. The content on the Websites, except all User Content (as defined below), including without limitation, the trademarks, copyrighted material, text, software, graphics, templates, photos, music, videos, and the like (“Site Content”), is owned by or licensed to the Alliance and is subject to trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws of the United States and foreign countries. You shall not retain, copy, publish, distribute, use or edit any Site Content or any portion of Site Content except as expressly allowed through use of the Websites during the term of this or any other agreement with us. For example, you may not retain, copy, publish, distribute, use or edit any materials prepared by or distributed by the Alliance after the term of this agreement or after termination of any account you may have with us. The Alliance reserves the right to add to, delete from, or modify any part of the Site Content at any time without notice.
6. User Content. You may be able to post user-generated content, such as articles, messages, notes, information, photos, policies, business documents, discussions, blog posts, and ratings (“User Content”) on the Websites. You will remain the owner of the User Content. By posting User Content, you grant the Alliance an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, edit, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), publish, and distribute such User Content for any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, on or in connection with the Alliance, the Websites or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing. By posting User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the right to post the User Content, that no third party rights will be violated by such posting, and that you have the right to grant the Alliance the rights granted herein. In posting User Content, you further agree that you shall not post any personal information belonging to another person, nor any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, slanderous, inflammatory, pornographic or profane material, material promoting a political agenda, or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense. You agree not to post User Content for any commercial purpose without the express written permission of the Alliance. Posting of JavaScript or other code, files or programs that interfere with this site’s operations is strictly prohibited. The posting of certain types of User Content may link to or require the use of a third party, such as a blog facilitator or a social media account; the Alliance has no responsibility for any interaction between you and a third party. The Alliance has the right to deny posting of, or to remove, any User Content, for any reason, at any time.
7. Fees. If you have signed up for a membership, service, or an account for which fees apply, you agree to the fees, time periods, and payment terms posted on the Websites for the services you have selected at the time you enrolled in such services. Such services may include certain packages, subscriptions, and other offerings that may be added to the Websites in the future. If you cancel any services or the account with which you use certain services, your payments are not refundable unless a different cancellation policy is identified for the particular Service you are using.
