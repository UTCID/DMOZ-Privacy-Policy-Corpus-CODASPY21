How to Help
August 29, 2020
GIVE NOW
How To Help
Here is a list of immediate ways you or your church can help in southwest Louisiana.
If you have a question, please email disasterresponse@la-umc.org for more details.
The most immediate way to help is to pray. Several people are using this article as a guide to prayer.  They are holding the individual churches in prayer as they know these church communities will be in the process of cleaning up and rebuilding.
In addition to prayer, there are other ways to help and they are listed below:
Give
ERT
Volunteer Opportunities
Give Financially
One of the most impactful ways to help is to give financially. Your donations will matter! They will help us respond today, tomorrow, and in the future as we continue to assess Louisiana residents' needs. You can head to this web site, or you can text "relief" to 800 500 5858.
Give Now
If you would like to mail a check, please mark the check "disaster response" and send to:
Louisiana Conference
527 North Blvd.
Baton Rouge, LA 70802
Early Response Teams
The Louisiana Conference is constantly in need of certified ERT responders.
Early Response Teams (ERT's) fill a specific need in the early days after a disaster to clean out flood-damaged homes, remove debris, place tarps on homes, and otherwise help to prevent further damage while providing a caring Christian presence.
ERT's are not the first-response group of emergency workers, nor are they recovery, rebuild, or repair teams.
You can follow news of future ERT trainings by heading to the ERT page.
Volunteer Opportunities
The next volunteer opportunity will be on Saturday, January 16th at University UMC in Lake Charles.
Please register here by January 8th. There will be a late registration the day of the event at 8:00 A.M.
You must be 18 or older to volunteer.
