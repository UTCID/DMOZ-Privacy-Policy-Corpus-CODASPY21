Royalty Magazine Vol. 25/10: Royal Wedding Special
Madeleine: The Designer Princess
The Princess who ran away with the circus
Welcome to the Royalty Magazine website. We have created this space for our readers to enjoy selections from the magazine’s thirty-three year history as well as regular updates and latest news.
‘Royalty’ was launched in 1981 for the wedding of The Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer but as the 1980s progressed the magazine’s popularity quickly reached a worldwide readership and the editorial expanded to cover the world’s royals, from Europe, Africa, The Middle East and Asia. Whether it was the whirlwind life of Princess Diana or an interview with the exiled Prince of Georgia, ‘Royalty’ became the magazine for royal watchers.
During the 1990s and 2000s  ‘Royalty’ further expanded its editorial scope with world exclusive collaborations with the Russian state archives, being the first western magazine to gain access to the Romanov family archives. Further collaborations followed, including another world exclusive with the archives of the Montenegrin royal family in Cetinje. Both projects resulted in two unique books ‘The Romanovs: Love, Power & Tragedy’ and “Nikola & Milena: King & Queen of the Black Mountain’.
Three decades plus of publishing experience have seen ‘Royalty’ evolve into a distinctive and definitive title. We hope you enjoy the new website as an introduction to the world of Royalty Magazine . . .
