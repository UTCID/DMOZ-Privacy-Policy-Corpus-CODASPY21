I. INTRODUCTION
Between 1.7 and 4% of the world population is born with
intersex conditions, having primary and secondary sexual
characteristics that are neither clearly male nor
female.1 The current recommended
treatment for an infant born with an intersex condition is
genital reconstruction surgery to render the child as clearly
sexed either male or female.2
Every day in the United States, five children are subjected
to genital reconstruction surgery that may leave them with
permanent physical and emotional scars.3 Despite efforts by intersexed people
to educate the medical community about their rejection of
infant genital reconstruction surgery, the American medical
community has not yet accepted the fact that differences in
genital size and shape do not necessarily require surgical
correction.4
[page 42] Genital
reconstruction surgery may involve removing part or all of
the penis and scrotum or clitoris and labia of a child,
remodeling a penis or creating a vaginal opening.5 While the initial surgery is typically
performed in the first month of a child's life, genital
reconstruction surgery is not only performed on
infants.6 Older children may be
subjected to multiple operations to construct "functional"
vaginas, to repair "damaged" penises, and to remove internal
sex organs.7 Personal accounts
written by intersexed adults indicate that some children have
been subjected to unwanted surgery throughout their childhood
and teenage years without a truthful explanation of their
condition.8
Genital reconstruction is rarely medically
necessary.9 Physicians perform
the surgeries so that intersexed children will not be
psychologically harmed when they realize that they are
different from their peers.10
Physicians remove external signs that children are
intersexed, believing that this will prevent the child and
the child's family from questioning the child's
gender.11 However, intersexed
children may very well feel more confused about their gender
if they are raised without any explanation about their
intersex condition or input into their future treatment
options.12 The medical
community's current practice focuses solely on genital
appearance, discounting the fact that chromosomes also affect
individuals' gender identities and personalities.13
Operating on children out of a belief that
it is crucial for children to have genitals that conform to
male/female norms ignores the fact that even the best
reconstruction surgery is never perfect.14 Genital reconstruction surgery may
result [page 43] in scarred
genitals, an inability to achieve orgasm, or an inability to
reproduce naturally or through artificial
insemination.15 The
community-held belief that an individual's ability to engage
in intercourse is essential, even without orgasm or
reproductive capability, seems to govern the decision to
perform genital surgery on many otherwise healthy, intersexed
children.16
Despite the intersex community's rejection
of genital reconstruction surgery, no U.S. court has examined
the legality of performing these operations without the
individual child's consent.17
By contrast, Colombian courts have heard three such cases and
have created a new standard for evaluating a parent's right
to consent to genital reconstruction surgery for their minor
children.18 In response to the
Colombian rulings and pressure from intersex activists, the
American Bar Association recently proposed a resolution
recommending that physicians adopt the heightened informed
consent procedures required by the Colombian Constitutional
Court decisions.19
This Article questions whether genital
reconstruction surgery is necessary in the Twenty-first
Century. Part II discusses the history and current preferred
"treatment" for intersex conditions. Part III explains the
groundbreaking Colombian Appellate Court decisions
prohibiting parental consent for genital reconstruction on
children over the age of five, and establishing a heightened
informed consent doctrine for younger children. Part IV
analyzes the protection that current U.S. law could provide
to intersexed children. Part V explores how international law
may influence decisions regarding the treatment of intersexed
children.
II. A HISTORY OF COLLUSION:
DESTROYING EVIDENCE OF AMBIGUOUS GENITALS
The term "intersex" is used to describe a variety of
conditions in which a fetus develops differently than a
typical XX female or XY male.20
Some intersexed children are born with "normal" male or
female external genitals that do not correspond to their
hormones.21 Others are born
with a noticeable combination of male and female external
features, and still others have visually male or female
external characteristics that correspond to their chromosomes
but do not correspond [page 44] to
their internal gonads.22
Individuals who are considered intersexed may also be born
with matching male chromosomes, gonads, and genitals but
suffer childhood disease or accident that results in full or
partial loss of their penis.23
The loss of a penis may lead physicians to recommend that a
boy be sexually reassigned as female.24 Although the conditions differ, the
commonality of intersexed people is that their gonads,
chromosomes, and external genitalia do not coincide to form a
typical male or female.25 The
current American medical treatment of intersexuals is to
alter the individual's internal and external gonads to sex
them as either clearly male or clearly female.26
Medical "treatment" of intersexuals has only
been practiced in the United States since the 1930s.27 During that period, the medical
community determined that intersexed people were truly male
or female but had not fully developed in the womb.28 Hormone treatments and surgical
interventions were meant to complete the formation of an
intersexed adult into a "normal" man or woman.29 By the 1950s, physicians were able
to identify most intersex conditions at birth and began
operating immediately on intersexed children to eliminate any
physical differences.30
Prior to the treatment of intersexuality in
the United States, intersexed Americans were treated as
either male or female according to their dominant physical
characteristics.31 This strict
male/female delineation is not used in all countries though.
Other cultures have treated intersexuals differently, either
as a third sex, neither male nor female, or as natural sexual
variations of the male or female sex.32 Alternatively, some societies still
accept intersexed people without clearly defining their sex
at birth.33
For instance, within small communities in
the Dominican Republic and Papua New Guinea, there is a
hereditary intersex condition known as 5-alpha reductase
deficiency that occurs with a relatively high
frequency.34 This condition
causes male children to be born with very small or
unrecognizable penises.35
During puberty, the children's male hormones cause their
penises to grow and other secondary male [page 45] sexual characteristics to
develop.36 Most of these
children are raised as girls and begin living as men when
they reach puberty.37 These
communities have accepted these intersexuals without genital
reconstruction surgery.38 In
the United States, however, a child with the same condition
would likely be surgically altered at birth, raised as a girl
and treated with hormones to prevent the onset of male
physical development.39
Genital reconstruction surgery became
standard practice in the United States through the efforts of
John Money, a John Hopkins University professor.40 Money introduced the theory that
children are not born with a gender identity, but rather form
an understanding of gender through their social
upbringing.41 He based this
theory on early research done with intersexed children who
were surgically altered at birth and raised as either male or
female.42 Money's research
found that children who were born with exactly the same
genetic makeup and physical appearance fared equally well
when raised as either females or males. He concluded that
chromosomes did not make any difference in gender
differentiation, and that children could be successfully
reared as either sex irrespective of their anatomy or
chromosomal make-up.43 Money
attempted to prove his theory by demonstrating that a
"normal" male child could be successfully raised as a female
with Bruce Reimer.44
In 1972, Money made public his experimental
sex reassignment surgery on a twenty-two-month-old male child
named Bruce Reimer who had been accidentally castrated during
a routine circumcision.45 The
doctor who examined Reimer shortly after the accident
believed that he would be unable to live a normal sexual life
as an adolescent and would grow up feeling incomplete and
physically defective.46 Money's
solution was to perform a sex change operation on baby Bruce
and to have his parents raise him as a girl named Brenda.
During Brenda's childhood, Money removed all of "his"
internal reproductive organs. As Brenda approached puberty
"she" was given female hormones to trigger breast development
and other female secondary characteristics.47 By removing Brenda's gonads, Money
destroyed Brenda's reproductive capability. However, Money
believed that by changing Brenda's sex, he would make it
possible for her to engage in intercourse and marry.48
[page 46] Early
reports of Money's experiment claimed that the operation was
successful and that Brenda was a happy, healthy girl.49 Money's research was published
throughout the world, convincing doctors that gender was a
societal construct, and therefore intersexed children could
be raised unconditionally as either male or female.50 He believed that the only way to
ensure that both the family and the child would accept the
child's gender was if the child's genitals looked clearly
male or female. Based on this theory, babies born with
ambiguous genitals or small penises and baby boys who were
accidentally castrated were surgically altered and raised as
females.51 Similarly, children
born with mixed genitalia, gonads, and chromosomes were
surgically altered to fit the definition of a "normal" male
or female.52 Following U.S.
lead, other countries also began to practice routine genital
reconstruction surgery on intersexed infants.53
Despite the widespread use of genital
reconstruction surgery, there is no research showing that
intersexuals benefit psychologically from the surgery
performed on them as infants and toddlers.54 No follow-up studies were ever done
on adult intersexuals who underwent genital reconstruction
surgery as children.55 In the
late 1980s, researchers attempting to disprove Money's gender
identity theory began searching for Brenda, the subject of
Money's highly publicized research.56 The boy who was raised as a girl was
now living as a man and had changed his name to David.57 In 1997, Milton Diamond and Keith
Sigmundson published an article rebutting the results of
Money's famous gender research.58 The publicity caused by Diamond and
Sigmundson's article led to a biography of Reimer by John
Colapinto. When Colapinto interviewed Reimer in 1997, Reimer
admitted that he had always been certain that he was not a
girl, despite being deceived by his doctor and his
family.59
Reimer suffered emotional duress at all
stages of his development, despite the corrective surgery
that was meant to make him "normal." In his biography of
Reimer, Colapinto describes the painful experiences that
Reimer suffered throughout his childhood and teenage
years.60 During her childhood,
Brenda did not fit in with her peers and felt isolated and
confused.61 As early as
kindergarten, other children [page
47] teased Brenda about her masculinity and failure to
adopt "girl's play."62 Although
her kindergarten teacher was not initially told of her sex
change, the teacher reported realizing that Brenda was very
different from other girls.63
In addition to her failure to fit in
socially, Brenda was constantly reminded that she was
different by her parents and Dr. Money. During her visits to
John Hopkins, Money would often force her to engage in sexual
role-play with her twin brother in order to enforce that she
was a girl and he was a boy.64
Her genitals were scarred and painful as a child and she
hated to look at them.65 She
became suspicious that something terrible had been done to
her, primarily due to the frequent doctor's visits with John
Money. During these visits, Dr. Money and his associates
questioned Brenda about her genitals and her gender
identity.66 Rather than
enforcing her gender identity, the medical intervention
compounded the trauma caused by her medical condition.
One particularly traumatic procedure
inflicted on intersexed children was not discussed in the
biography of David Reimer. Intersexed children who have
artificially created vaginas must undergo vaginal dilation
procedures throughout their early childhood.67 In order to ensure that the newly
created vaginal opening does not close up, the child's
parents must insert an object into the child's vagina on a
daily basis.68 This procedure
has sexual implications that may be emotionally traumatic for
many children.
As a teenager, Reimer rejected his assigned
sex and refused to take his female hormones. He reported
engaging in typically male behavior throughout his teens. He
dressed as a male, chose a trade school for mechanics, and
even began urinating standing up.69 When Reimer's parents finally told
him that he was born male, he immediately chose to adopt a
male identity and changed his name to David.70 He had a penis constructed and
implanted, and underwent breast reduction surgery to rid
himself of the breasts developed through estrogen
therapy.71 There is no
procedure that can replace the gonads that were removed as
part of Reimer's sex reassignment surgery. There is also no
cure for the deception that he experienced upon learning that
his parents and doctors had lied to him about many aspects of
his life.72 The trauma of
learning about his condition caused David to attempt suicide
on several occasions.73
David is now married and has adopted his
wife's children.74 His story
reads as a happy ending to many people. However, David could
have avoided the gender [page 48]
dysphoria, loss of reproductive capability, and many years of
therapy that resulted from genital reconstruction surgery.
These experiences are not atypical in the intersexed
community. According to many intersexed activists, the
comfort of being raised in a clear gender role does not
outweigh the pain of deception or the physical side effects
associated with the surgery.75
Despite the emotional and physical scars
that people like David Reimer face from genital
reconstruction surgery, the majority of American physicians
continue to encourage early childhood surgery.76 In some cases, physicians have
insisted on performing genital reconstruction surgery on
teenagers without their consent.77
In 1993, an intersexed activist named Cheryl
Chase began a support and advocacy group for intersexed
adults called the Intersex Society of North America
("ISNA").78 Chase was born with
a large clitoris, which was removed when she was an
infant.79 When she was eight
years old, her internal gonads were removed without her
knowledge or consent.80 Because
of the surgery, she is no longer capable of having her own
children or obtaining orgasm.81
Today, Chase and other advocates are vocal about their hope
for a moratorium on the invasive treatment of intersexed
children.82
ISNA members have contributed significantly
to the debate over genital reconstruction surgery by
providing personal insight into the effects of surgery on
intersexed adults. As of the late 1990s, more than 400
intersexed individuals from around the world contacted ISNA
and recounted stories similar to Ms. Chase's.83 According to ISNA, sex change
operations and genital normalizing surgeries should not be
performed on children until the child has the ability to
consent personally to the operation.84
At this point, there is insufficient proof
that intersexed adults who are not operated on fair any worse
than intersexed adults who have had genital reconstruction
surgery as children.85 The only
research that has been done on intersexed adults who have not
been surgically altered also comes from John Money. In the
1940s, prior to his well-known study on Reimer, Money
interviewed many intersexed adults about their gender
identity and upbringing.86 To
his surprise, he found that intersexed adults who had not
undergone genital reconstruction surgery [page 49] had a gender identity
comparable to other adult males and females.87 Unfortunately this research was done
as part of Money's doctoral thesis and was never
published.88
III. THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S RULING
Public authorities, the medical community and the citizens
in general must make room for these people who have been
silenced until now.89 In 1995,
Colombia's highest court, the Constitutional Court, addressed
the legality of performing gender reconstruction surgery on
children.90 The Constitutional
Court has issued three decisions on the constitutionality of
genital reconstruction surgery, and, as of the publication
date of this Article, it is the only court in the world to
have rendered an opinion on this issue.91 The first case that the court
considered was brought by a teenage boy who had been raised
as a girl under circumstances very much like David
Reimer's.92 Several years after
this first case, the court decided two other cases involving
children born with intersex conditions.93 These three cases have limited
parents' rights to choose genital reconstruction surgery for
their children in Colombia.
The first case, Sentencia No. T-477/95
[hereinafter Gonzalez, involved a male infant who was
accidentally castrated during circumcision and was
subsequently subjected to a sex change operation.94 His physicians performed the sex
change operation so that his genitals would conform to
societal norms and he would be capable of sexual intercourse
as an adult.95 As a teenager,
Gonzalez learned of the operation and sued the doctors and
hospital that allowed the operation to be performed without
his consent.96 The Colombian
Constitutional Court heard Gonzalez's appeal and found that
this operation violated the boy's fundamental right to human
dignity and gender identity.97
The court based its decisions on the Colombian Constitution
and the international covenant on human rights guaranteed
[page 50] by the Inter-American
Court of Human Rights.98 The
court ruled that doctors could not alter the gender of a
patient, regardless of the patient's age, without the
patient's own informed consent.99
Several years after Gonzalez, the parents of
two children born with intersex conditions brought their
cases to court seeking the authority to consent to surgery on
behalf of their minor children.100 In both cases, the children's
physicians had recommended genital reconstruction surgery,
but refused to perform the surgery without each child's
consent.101 For the first time
in the world, a court addressed the issue of whether parents
should be allowed to consent to genital reconstruction
surgery on their intersexed children. Although these cases
were not identical to Gonzalez, the hospital feared that if
it performed genital reconstruction surgery on any child
without the child's consent, it could be held liable under
Gonzalez.102 The Colombian
Constitutional Court heard both cases on appeal.103
In Sentencia No. SU-337/99 [hereinafter
Ramos, the Colombian Constitutional Court considered the case
of an eight-year-old intersexed child raised as a girl and
diagnosed with male pseudo-hermaphroditism.104 Ramos was born with XY (male)
chromosomes but due to her inability to process male
hormones, her external genitalia did not fully
develop.105 Ramos had a small
penis (three centimeters), folds of skin that did not contain
testicles, male gonads, and a urinal opening at the base of
her perineum.106
According to the documents received at the
trial court level, Ramos' doctors were not aware that she was
intersexed until she was three years old.107 Until that point, Ramos' mother
had raised her as a girl without questioning whether she
might not have female chromosomes. When Ramos' pediatrician
became aware that the child was intersexed, the doctor
recommended that she receive genital reconstruction surgery
to remove her small penis and gonads and to construct a
vagina.108 The doctor
recommended the sex change operation because although Ramos
had a small penis, it would never grow to the size of a
typical penis, and it would never function properly.109 Additionally, Ramos had been
raised as a girl thus far, had a female name, wore feminine
clothing, and identified with the social role of Colombian
women.110
Ramos' mother brought this action to force
the hospital to accept her consent on behalf of Ramos so that
the doctors could proceed with the surgery.111 Ramos' mother alleged that if the
hospital waited to perform surgery until Ramos could [page 51] consent for herself, the child
would be psychologically harmed because she would grow up
without a clear gender identity.112
However despite being raised female, the
trial court found that Ramos' gender was ambiguous because
"in some aspects she behaves like a woman and in some aspects
like a man."113 It also
concluded that every person should have the right to develop
his or her own gender identity as a part of the development
of his or her personality.114 The
trial court stated that nobody could determine what the
gender identity of this child would be except for the child
herself, denying Ramos' mother the right to consent to
surgery.115 Ramos' mother
appealed the case to the Constitutional Court.
By the time the case was heard on appeal,
Ramos was eight years old.116
After considering medical information and briefs from experts
around the world, the Constitutional Court upheld the trial
court's decision denying Ramos' mother the right to consent
to genital reconstruction surgery for her child.117 In its decision, the court referred
extensively to the Colombian Constitution, as well as
international laws and norms.118
[page 52] The
court considered the gravity of the procedure and the
negative effects it could have on the child if she were to
reject her assigned sex, and found that substitute judgment
should not be allowed. The Constitutional Court quoted the
trial court's opinion, noting that it would be wrong for
anyone to consent to a sex change operation other than the
child herself.119 In reaching
its conclusion, the court discussed the lack of evidence of
any psychological harm to children that are not operated on,
and the existence of actual evidence of psychological harm to
children that have had such operations.120
The Ramos decision did not seem to rely on
the individual facts of the case, but rather on the
overreaching harm of the surgery as compared to the unproven
benefits. However in its next case, the Constitutional Court
seems to have made its decision based on the individual facts
of the case, primarily that the surgery had already been
performed with no major problems.121
In the Constitutional Court's next decision,
Sentencia No. T-551/99 [hereinafter Cruz,122 the court relied heavily on the
information provided in Ramos.123 However, the decision in Cruz was
substantially weaker than both of the previous decisions,
limiting its prior holdings to children over the age of
five.124 Cruz was born with XX
(female) chromosomes and male external genitalia.125 Her parents were seeking to have
her clitoris/penis removed or reduced in size so that she
would look more female.126 At
the age of two, Cruz was already aware that her genitals were
different from those of her family members.127 However since Cruz was much
younger then Ramos, the trial court did not rely on facts
regarding Cruz's own gender identity. After hearing the case,
the trial court held that Cruz's parents could consent to
genital reconstruction surgery on her behalf if their consent
was "informed."128
Cruz was only three years old when the case
was brought to the attention of the Constitutional Court and
had already undergone genital reconstruction surgery.129 The Constitutional Court decided
to hear the case in order to set a standard for the lower
courts to follow in the future.130 The court found that Cruz's
parents did not really understand the implications of the
operation on their child's life. Believing that their child
would be "normalized" by the procedure, the parents were
given the impression that surgery was their only
option.131 Since the parents
were not properly [page 53]
informed about the procedure or provided alternative options,
the court held that Cruz's rights had been violated despite
her young age.132 Although it
was too late to make any changes in the decision that was
already made for Cruz, the court ordered that an
interdisciplinary team be put together to support the child
and her family in the future.133
In this decision, the court could have
followed its reasoning in Ramos to ban parental consent to
genital reconstruction surgeries on all children.
134 However,
instead of following its own precedent, the court decided
that parents should be allowed to consent to surgery on
children under age five.135
The court explained that Cruz was too young to have formed a
gender identity.136 By
prohibiting parental consent for the surgery, the court
stated that it would be intruding into the realm of family
privacy.137 The court also
stated that prohibiting this surgery altogether would be like
a social experiment in which children were the
subjects.138 Had it decided to
prohibit the surgery on young children, the intersexed
children following this case would be the first children in
the country to be prohibited from obtaining sex
assignment/reconstruction surgery.139
While deciding not to make room for the
intersexed, the court made clear that it did not intend to
leave the decision whether to operate at the full discretion
of the parents either. It reasoned that parents might be
fearful of intersex conditions and discriminate against their
children, consenting to operations not truly in the child's
best interest.140 Finally, the
court concluded that the medical community should establish a
protocol allowing parents to consent to genital
reconstruction surgery only after they establish that it is
truly in their child's best interest, creating a new form of
"qualified and persistent, informed consent."141
The court in Cruz gave Colombian parents the
right to substitute judgment for infants and young children
who have already achieved consciousness of their bodies;
however, parents can only give consent after fully
understanding the consequences of the surgery for their
child. In Cruz, the court clarified that its decision to
withhold parental consent in Ramos was based on the fact that
Ramos was eight years old when her case was decided.142 Cruz narrowed the individual
consent doctrine to apply to children over the age of five,
holding that intersexed children over the age of five must
give their informed consent before undergoing genital
reconstruction surgery.143
In Cruz, the court determined that in order
for parental consent to genital reconstruction surgery to be
valid for children under the age of five, three criteria must
be met: (i) detailed information must be provided, and the
parent must be informed of the pros and cons that have
sparked the current debate; (ii) the consent must be in
writing, to formalize the decision and to ensure its
seriousness; and (iii) [page 54]
the authorization must be given in stages.144 This last qualification is
intended to permit the parents the time to bond with their
child the way that he or she is, and not to make a
prejudicial decision based on shock at the baby's
appearance.145 The court
stated that it would be up to the medical community and the
legislature to determine the specific details for the consent
procedure.146
Doctors generally recommend surgery for
intersexed children at birth.147 Ramos' mother was forced to wait
until Ramos was eight years old only because the trial court
originally denied permission for her to give consent for the
operation.148 However
important the investigation and dicta was in Ramos, most
intersexed children will not benefit from it. Most often,
surgery will be performed when the child is still an infant
and only the heightened informed consent will be directly
applicable to them.149 By
limiting the holding of Ramos in Cruz to children over the
age of five, the court diminished the significance of
Ramos.
All three of the Colombian Court's decisions
could have fundamentally altered the individual rights of
intersexed children in Colombia. Instead, they have only
given the parents of intersexed children the right to more
information before they consent to genital reconstruction
surgery. Perhaps some parents will obtain enough information
to decide to decline these operations. However, in the end,
it is still the parent and not the child who will be able to
determine what gender the child will be, whether the child
will be able to reproduce, and who the child will be allowed
to marry. Given the opportunity to make a huge difference in
the lives of intersexed people around the world, the
Colombian Court's decision did not adequately protect this
"marginalized and forgotten minority."150
Despite the Colombian Court's reticence
about banning infant genital reconstruction surgery,
Colombian law still provides far more protection for intersex
children then current American law. The Colombian Court's
decisions have increased the world's awareness of the
problems with genital reconstruction surgery and reopened the
medical debate regarding genital reconstruction surgery in
the United States.
IV. MAKING ROOM FOR INTERSEXUALS IN
THE UNITED
STATES
The United States does not currently provide any procedural
protection for intersexed children. In the United States,
doctors are not required to receive the consent of intersexed
children before performing genital reconstruction
surgery.151 Neither are
parents routinely given sufficient information to make an
informed decision on their child's behalf.152 Currently, the United States lacks
even the [page 55] standard for
informed consent instituted after the Colombian Court's final
decision in Cruz.153
Thus far, there has been no legal challenge
brought on behalf of intersexed children in the United
States. Intersexed adults who have inquired about suing their
doctors for performing genital reconstruction surgery that
altered their gender have met resistance.154 Intersexed adults have been told
that because the doctors followed standard medical practice
when they performed the surgery, the doctors are not liable
for medical malpractice.155
Unlike the Colombian Constitution, the U.S.
Constitution does not have specific provisions protecting a
child's right to bodily integrity. However, the Constitution
has been interpreted to protect privacy rights, including the
right to marry and reproduce, and the right to bodily
integrity generally.156 Common
law also provides some protection for children when there is
no "informed" consent, or when a parent's consent or lack of
consent to medical treatment is found to be contrary to the
child's best interest.157 In
addition to case law supporting the need for informed consent
and the best interest of the child, there are recent federal
and state statutes protecting female children from genital
mutilation.158 Thus, while no
intersexed Americans have successfully sued a physician or
hospital for conducting early genital reconstructive surgery,
they may have grounds to sue based on female genital
mutilation laws, the constitutional right to privacy and lack
of informed consent by their parents.
A. CONSTITUTIONAL
PROTECTION FOR INTERSEXUALS:
LEAVING ROOM FOR AN OPEN FUTURE
The U.S. Constitution protects individuals from overreaching
government powerthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, which
states "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law
..."159 The U.S. Supreme Court
has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment as protecting
individuals from government action that [page 56] infringes upon certain
"fundamental rights" considered "implicit in the concept of
ordered liberty."160
The Supreme Court has found that the right
to bodily autonomy, the right to choose whether or not to
reproduce, the right to marry, and the right to make
decisions about how to raise children are all fundamental
privacy rights.161 The
government may not violate a person's liberty by infringing
any of these rights without first proving in a court of law
that there is a compelling state interest that must be
served, and that the method that the government is using is
narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental
interest.162
Historically, children have not been
accorded the same constitutional rights as adults. A child's
parents and the government are allowed to restrict some
rights that would be held fundamental for an adult.163 The Supreme Court has also
recognized a fundamental right to family privacy, according
parents a high degree of respect regarding decisions they
make about their child's upbringing.164 This includes the choices parents
make regarding their children's medical care.165 Despite the Fourteenth Amendment
right to family privacy, the parents' rights must be weighed
against the children's rights to be protected against harm.
The doctrine of parens patriae articulates the government's
interest in protecting the rights of vulnerable individuals
from harm.166
The doctrine of parens patriae allows the
government to interfere with parents' choices about how to
raise their children when the children may be harmed because
of the parents' actions or inactions.167 Generally, the government
interferes with [page 57] parental
decisions under laws prohibiting parental abuse or
neglect.168 In the case of
intersexed children, the government may have reason to
override the parents' decision to perform surgery if the
surgery would harm the child.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit
an individual from violating another individual's fundamental
rights. Thus, a child cannot generally sue a hospital or a
physician for an infringement of his or her constitutional
rights. For there to be a constitutional violation, there
must be state action.169 If
genital reconstruction surgery is performed at a state
hospital, then there is state action allowing the child to
sue the hospital directly. If the surgery is conducted at a
private hospital, there may not be state action. In that
case, in order to implicate the Fourteenth Amendment, an
intersexed child who is about to be subjected to genital
reconstruction surgery must seek an injunction against the
hospital prior to the surgery.170 If a judge orders the surgery to
progress, there is state action, and the child may claim a
constitutional violation.171
If the child successfully claims that the surgery violates a
fundamental right, then in order for the court to order the
surgery over the objection of the child or his or her court
appointed representative, the proponents must prove, by clear
and convincing evidence, that the surgery is in the child's
best interest.172 This
standard is high, and in order to prevail, the proponent of
the surgery must establish that there are no less restrictive
means to accomplish the same result.173 Since there are no studies proving
that genital reconstruction surgery psychologically benefits
children, and there are testimonial accounts that genital
reconstruction surgery causes psychological and physical
trauma, it is unlikely that the court would find that there
was clear and convincing evidence of best interest.
[page 58] 1.
Bodily Integrity: If It Works, Don't Fix It
Included in the Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy is the
right to bodily autonomy, which protects individuals from
intrusion by the government into their health care
decisions.174 This right
includes the right to choose to forego medical treatment,
even if foregoing treatment may result in death.175 For the most part, children are
not accorded the right to choose medical treatment or to
choose to forego medical treatment without parental consent,
despite the fact that it has been found to be a fundamental
right.176 The reason that
parents are allowed to consent for children is that a child
may not be able to understand fully the consequences of their
own consent because of their age or inexperience.177
There are several exceptions to the rule
requiring parental consent to treatment. The first exception
accepted by several states by statute is the "mature minor"
exception.178 Minors who are
considered mature enough to make their own medical decisions
need not obtain parental consent to medical treatment, and
may object to medical treatment that their parents choose for
them.179
Many states have also provided exceptions to
parental consent requirements for children seeking treatment
for drug addiction, mental health treatment, and testing and
treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.180 The logic behind these exceptions
is that these treatments are very personal, and if required
to seek parental consent, many children would forego
treatment. If children could not be treated for HIV, drug
addiction, or mental illness, they would likely place
themselves and others in danger.181
These exceptions take into account the fact
that parents do not always act in their child's best
interest, and a child may suffer abuse or psychological harm
if required to seek parental consent to certain treatments.
The right to choose whether or not to undergo genital
reconstruction surgery should be an exception to the general
rule allowing parental consent to treatment of minors.
Genital reconstruction surgery is a personal choice that
children should be allowed to make on their own in certain
circumstances, or, at a minimum, in conjunction with their
parents. It is difficult for many children to learn about
their intersexuality. However, it is also hard for children
to learn to cope with pregnancy, drug addiction, mental
illness, or their HIV positive status. In contrast to
intersex conditions, all of the above medical conditions are
free of parental consent requirements under certain
circumstances.
Genital reconstruction surgery is arguably
the ultimate infringement of an individual's bodily autonomy.
Genital reconstruction surgery can cause a child significant
psychological and physical harm.182 For these reasons, parents should
not be allowed to make the decision to alter surgically their
child's genitals without [page 59]
the child's consent absent clear and convincing evidence that
it is in the child's best interest. If the state participates
by allowing the procedure to be performed at a state hospital
or by ordering the procedure over the child's objection, then
there may be a constitutional violation of the child's right
to bodily autonomy under the Fourteenth Amendment.
2. Reproduction: Gonads Cannot Be
Replaced
The right to choose whether or not to reproduce is a
fundamental right and, accordingly, certain restrictions are
placed on the government's right to interfere with decisions
bearing on reproduction.183
For example, all minors regardless of age have the right to
seek an abortion without undue burden from the state, though
the state may act to ensure that a woman's decision is
informed.184 Therefore, even
when state law requires minors to receive parental consent
before seeking an abortion, minors are permitted a judicial
bypass, allowing them the right to prove to a court that they
are mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion
without parental consent.185
Children may also have the right to seek contraception,
treatment for pregnancy, and childbirth without parental
consent.186
Because reproduction is a fundamental right,
parents are limited in their ability to consent to
sterilization procedures for their children. Generally,
sterilization is raised in the context of a parent who wants
to sterilize a handicapped child to protect the child from
the harm of a dangerous pregnancy. If there is an objection
made by the child or an advocate for the child, then a court
cannot order the procedure against the child's objections
without affording the child due process.187 The child must be appointed an
independent guardian ad litem, and receive a fair trial at
which the court must determine by clear and convincing
evidence that the operation to remove the child's gonads will
be in the child's best interest.188
As with all people, some intersexed adults
do not have the ability to reproduce even without genital
reconstruction surgery.189
Others will retain their full [page
60] reproductive capacity even after the surgery is
performed.190 However, some
intersexuals have the ability to reproduce either naturally
or artificially and are denied that right by the removal of
their gonads and other reproductive organs. For those
children whose gonads are removed to complete their physical
transformation, their fundamental right to reproduce has been
violated. For example, a child born with male chromosomes and
sexed at birth as female will have her gonads removed, thus,
effectively sterilizing her.
Based on the lack of evidence of the
effectiveness of genital reconstruction surgery, it would be
difficult for a court to determine that this procedure is
clearly in the child's best interest. If there are pros and
cons to performing the surgery, the court must decide in a
manner that will not violate the child's fundamental right to
reproduce.191
3. Marriage: Determining Gender Determines
Sexuality
Genital reconstruction surgery may inhibit or completely
interfere with a child's fundamental right to marry. In the
United States, there are currently no states in which it is
legal to marry someone of the same sex.192 In 1993, several gay couples
challenged the prohibition against same-sex marriages under
the Hawaii Constitution.193
The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and
allowed the first gay couples to marry legally.194 In reaction to the ruling, the
Hawaii state legislature immediately amended their own
constitution to prohibit same-sex marriages.195 The federal government reacted to
the first gay marriages by passing the Defense of Marriage
Act, which allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex
marriages that are legally valid in another state.196 Given that 3% of the world
population does not fit into a clearly defined sex and still
engage in marriage and child birth, it would be wise to
re-think this prohibition.
However, given the laws as they currently
stand, genital reconstruction surgically defines an
intersexed person as male or female, thus, prohibiting them
from marriage to a person of their "same" gender.
Intersexuals are in a unique position before they undergo
genital reconstruction surgery because they can petition the
court to change their legal gender from female to male or
male to female without having to undergo a sex change
operation. They must prove that they are intersexed, [page 61] that they have unclear
genitals, and that they identify as the opposite sex, and
their birth certificate may be altered.197
Once an intersexed person has undergone
genital reconstruction surgery making his or her genitals
clearly male or female, he or she cannot then choose to
change his or her birth certificate without having a second
round of surgeries performed.198 For example, if a child born with
male chromosomes or mixed chromosomes is surgically assigned
a female gender at birth, that individual would be prohibited
from marrying a female later in life without first undergoing
another sex change operation.199 In this case, if the initial
gender reconstruction surgery had not been performed, this
person would be considered a male, not a homosexual female,
and thus would have a fundamental right to marry.
By choosing a gender for the child and
performing reconstruction surgery at birth, the doctors may
be infringing on an individual's ability to marry as an
adult. The imposition of additional surgery to change their
assigned sex would add such high financial and emotional
costs on the individual that it may prohibit some, otherwise
qualified, intersexuals from marrying.
B. TAKING A FIRST STEP: INFORMING PARENTS
THAT THEIR
CHILD IS
INTERSEXED
Physicians must receive informed consent from all patients
before they treat them for any medical condition.200 If physicians fail to obtain
informed consent from their patients, they may be liable for
medical malpractice.201 Under
the informed consent doctrine, a patient may even choose to
refuse life saving treatment after weighing their treatment
options.202 The informed
consent doctrine originated in the tort doctrine of battery,
which includes intentionally touching a person in a way that
they find harmful or offensive.203 The surgical removal of part or
all of a child's genitals must only be done after receiving
informed consent or it may be considered battery.
[page 62] Absent a
recognized exception allowing children to consent to their
own medical treatment, parents will generally be allowed to
give or withhold consent for medical treatment on behalf of
their children. In the United States, genital reconstruction
surgery is not currently a procedure that children are
allowed to consent or object to without their parents'
participation. For informed consent to be valid, the parents
must be informed of the nature and consequence of their
child's medical condition, as well as the various treatment
options available.
The Colombian standard of informed consent
ensures that doctors provide parents with all of the known
information about intersex conditions over a prolonged period
of time. Doctors must provide surgical and non-surgical
options for treatment, and refer parents to support
organizations for intersexed individuals.204 This model ensures that parents
are not deceived about their child's prognosis, and that they
understand that genital reconstruction surgery is not the
only solution for their child.
In the United States, parents of intersexed
children are not given enough information to make a truly
informed decision about their child's treatment.205 Some parents are not told that
their child is intersexed, but instead that their child is a
girl or boy with "unfinished" genitals that the doctor will
repair with surgery.206
Physicians may also tell the parents that their baby will
have "normal" genitals after surgery.207 Surgery may make the child's
genitals look more clearly male or female, but it will also
leave scarring and possibly diminish sexual functions.208 Generally, more than one surgery
is needed to alter completely the genital appearance, and the
average number of surgeries is three or more.209 Surgery and check-ups will continue
through the child's early years and may be extremely
stressful for the child and his or her parents.210
Additionally, parents must understand that
while surgery will make intersexed children look more similar
to their peers, it will not change their chromosomes. Even
with hormone therapy, many intersexed youth will endure
gender dysphoria.211 They may
feel confused about their gender despite having genitals that
look clearly male or female. Intersexed adults may decide
that their assigned gender is not their gender of choice.
This might promp the desire for additional, more complicated
surgeries to perform a complete sex change operation.212 Most of these facts are not
presented to the parents of intersexed children at the time
that they approve genital reconstruction surgery.213 If parents are encouraged to
consent to surgery without being told of the risks and side
effects, their consent is not truly informed.
There are several exceptions to the rule for
informed consent. The first exception is when there is a
medical emergency and a person's life or health is in
immediate danger, the doctors may proceed with a procedure if
they have not [page 63] received
instructions to the contrary.214 Most intersexed infants are not in
any immediate danger that would exempt a physician from
receiving informed consent to operate.215 Even when intersexed infants have
medical conditions that require surgical intervention on an
emergency basis, the emergency aid can be given without
removing any part of the child's body that is not immediately
harming the child.216
Physicians have relied upon the emergency doctrine to perform
full sex change operations on children.217 The argument is that if a parent
were to learn that their child was intersexed, they might
raise their child without a clear gender identity thus
causing the child psychological harm.218
Additionally, under the guise of an
emergency situation, parents are placed under unnecessary
time pressure to decide whether or not to consent to surgery.
They are encouraged to make a decision about surgery in the
first few weeks of their newborn's life. During the first few
weeks after giving birth, parents may be stressed and anxious
about their newborn's condition. They should be given more
time to become accustomed to their child's body before
doctors recommend surgery that is not medically necessary.
This pressure forces parents to make decisions without
seeking outside information to determine if there is a true
medical necessity for the surgery.219 In some cases, children have been
operated on even after their parents explicitly refused to
give consent.220
The emergency doctrine was not meant to
prevent hypothetical psychological harm to the patient or
their parents, but to prevent death or serious impairment to
a patient in an emergency situation.221 Physicians should not surgically
remove or alter any part of an intersexed child's genitals
without informed consent absent a true medical emergency.
A doctor may also be exempt from explaining
the exact nature of the illness or treatment if it would be
unsafe for the patient because it would cause them extreme
physical or mental duress that would deteriorate their
condition.222 This exception
has also been used by physicians to lie to parents or
disguise the truth so that they will raise their child
without any doubts as to the child's gender.223 Reportedly, [page 64] doctors do not explain intersex
conditions to parents because they do not want to shock
them.224 Parents are
frequently told that their child must be operated on in order
to repair a minor birth defect. Doctors do not always tell
the parents the chromosomal make-up of their child, or
explain the ramifications of gender reassignment.225 Although the parents may feel
distressed upon learning of the child's condition, the
parents' distress is not enough to exempt doctors from fully
explaining the whole condition and the treatment
options.226 The emergency
exception applies to the patient's condition, not to the
parents' reaction to the patient's condition.
Additionally, if parents do not understand
that their child was born intersexed, they will not be in a
position to understand the issues their child may later
develop and his or her potential for gender dysphoria. If the
exceptions to informed consent were extended to prevent
harmful parental reactions to differences in their child,
doctors would have free reign to repair all congenital
abnormalities at the parent's cost without informing the
parent of the abnormality or obtaining their consent for the
surgery. The exceptions to the informed consent doctrine were
clearly not meant to extend this far.
C. GENITAL MUTILATION: EQUAL
PROTECTION FOR INTERSEXED
CHILDREN
Intersex children may also have a claim for medical
malpractice based on violation of the law prohibiting female
genital mutilation.227 In
1996, Congress passed the Criminalization of Female Genital
Mutilation Act.228 Five states
have also individually criminalized female genital
mutilation.229
The process of removing or altering the
genitalia of intersexed children is a form of genital
mutilation as defined by the statute.230 The law prohibits anyone from
authorizing or performing an operation on a female child to
remove all or part of her genitals for other than health
reasons.231 The statute
explicitly covers ritual circumcisions, even if the child
herself believes in the religious or cultural significance of
the procedure.232 In section
116(c), the law specifically states that no account shall be
taken of the effect of any belief that has led the person or
their family to demand the operation.233 This Act holds the physician liable
even if the family believed that the operation would be in
the child's best interest and it was standard practice in
their ethnic or religious community.234
According to the Act, the only way that
genital operations can be legally performed on female
children in the United States is if the doctor can show that
under section 116(b)(1), it is necessary for the health of
the person on whom it is [page 65]
performed.235 As the Colombian
Constitutional Court found through its extensive
international research, there is no evidence that most
surgery performed on intersexed children is done for other
than psychological reasons.236
When an intersexed child is operated on to
normalize his or her genitals, it is also part of a cultural
tradition. Parents want their child to look like other
children in Western countries, or as close to "normal" as
possible.237 In some Native
American cultures, India, the Dominican Republic, and Papua
New Guinea, intersexed people are accepted in society and
occupy a specific cultural and social position.238 In those cultures it would not be
considered beneficial to the child to alter the child's
genitals.
In the United States, intersexed children
are operated on in order to make them look like other
children who are not intersexed. Although some medical
conditions might endanger intersexed children and therefore
make the operations beneficial, this is not usually the
case.239 Most doctors who
agree with genital operations for intersexed children claim
that the surgery is necessary to protect their mental
health.240 However, no studies
have been done that support the question of whether or not
genital reconstruction and hormones actually protect the
mental health of the patient any better then counseling and
education.241
More than 400 intersexed people
internationally have contacted ISNA in support of its
opposition to genital reconstruction surgery on
children.242 The
Constitutional Court of Colombia noted that doctors could not
find any intersexed people willing to speak in support of
such surgery on children.243
The congressional findings on the practice
of female genital mutilation in the United States are
particularly relevant to the issue of genital surgery on
intersexed children. In particular, Congress found that
female genital mutilation harms women both physically and
psychologically.244 They found
that the practice violates both federal and state
constitutional and statutory laws.245
[page 66] The
damaging physical and psychological effects of genital
reconstruction surgery are identical to the effects of ritual
female circumcision. In both cases, the surgery may result in
pain, scarring, and the inability to achieve orgasm.246 Congressional findings that
females should not be subjected to the loss of any part of
their genitalia for cultural reasons is directly applicable
to intersexed children.
The Act indicates that parents do not have
the right to give consent to nonessential genital surgery and
doctors do not have the right to perform such surgery even if
it will make the children assimilate with their ethnic and
religious community.247 The
statute only applies to female children.248 If taken as such, the statute may
violate equal protection.249
However, the Act does not define "female" by genetic make-up
or external characteristics. Arguably, most intersexed
children fall under one definition of "female" or another.
Thus, intersexed children who have their clitoris reduced or
other genital parts removed seem to have a strong claim of
assault under the Female Genital Mutilation Act.
V. SEXUAL DIVERSITY AND
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The United States should consider international standards
for the treatment of children when considering the legality
of genital reconstruction surgery. One of the main standards
by which to judge the international consensus on children's
rights is the Convention on the Rights of the Child.250 The United States was one of only
two United Nations member countries that did not sign the
Convention on the Rights of the Child.251 Despite the fact that the United
States has not signed the Convention, it is an
internationally accepted standard that should be considered
by U.S. healthcare practitioners.
The Convention recognizes the rights of
children independent of their parents by allowing them to
veto parents' decisions on issues of health, education, and
religious upbringing.252 The
Convention specifically states that a child should have input
into all decisions affecting him or her.253 Because the decision to alter a
child's genitals will forever change the course of the
child's life, particular care should be taken to involve the
child in this decision.
The second international agreement that is
relevant to the treatment of intersexuals is the Nuremberg
Code, signed by the United States after World War II.254 The Nuremberg Code prohibits
countries from conducting experimental [page 67] medical treatments on patients
without their express informed consent.255 Since genital reconstruction surgery
has only been in practice during the last thirty years and no
studies have been done to prove the procedures effectiveness,
critics argue that genital reconstruction surgery is still
experimental.256 If the
procedure is an experimental procedure, then the level of
consent required should be higher.
Other countries look to the U.S. medical
establishment in developing standards of care.257 It is important for intersexed
children around the world that doctors within the United
States make a concerted effort to provide parents and
children with all available knowledge regarding intersex
conditions before making the recommendation to perform
genital reconstruction surgery.
VI. CONCLUSION
Through its research and publication of many of the facts
about intersex genital surgery, the Colombian Court has
opened up a worldwide medical, ethical, and legal debate.
However, rather than following the Colombian Court's
decision, the world should heed the court's advice. Diversity
should not be "a factor of violence and exclusion," but
rather it should be "an irreplaceable source of social
wealth."258 The court,
paraphrasing Johns Hopkins University professor, Dr. William
Reiner, challenges the world to listen to intersexuals and to
learn to coexist with them.259
With those words in mind, future legal
decisions in the United States and abroad should prohibit
hospitals from performing childhood genital reconstruction
surgery when it is not medically necessary. The current
insistence on genital "normalizing" surgery can be explained
by our society's obsession with physical appearance and our
fear of people who are "different."260 However, as the Americans with
Disabilities Act and other anti-discrimination laws integrate
more and more people with different physical characteristics
and abilities, society will begin to accept physical
differences as a natural and positive part of being
human.261 At the point [page 68] that our society makes room for
the intersexed through laws prohibiting gender reassignment
surgery and unnecessary genital reconstruction surgery on
children, then people will begin to acknowledge the existence
of intersexuals. When faced with the fact that 3% of the
population has chromosomes, genitals, and sexual
characteristics that are different, teachers will need to
modify sex education courses. Ideally, children will learn
that every individual has unique sexual characteristics that
help make up their gender identity and sexual preference.
Through open discussions of growth and sexual development,
intersexed children will learn that they are not alone, and
others will learn that intersexuality is a common condition
that may effect someone they know.262

HIM: THE
BOY WHO
WAS RAISED
AS A GIRL 143-50, 212-13 (2000). In his book,
Colapinto vividly describes the gender dysphoria and sexual
confusion of David Reimer, a boy raised as a girl after his
penis was destroyed during a botched circumcision. Id. at
143-50. This biographical account of Reimer's life was
written with the cooperation and participation of Reimer
himself who sat for more than 100 hours of interviews and
allowed the author access to all of his confidential files
and medical records. Id. at xvii. Colapinto also discusses
other children who have suffered extreme gender dysphoria
growing up without being informed of their condition. One
fourteen-year-old girl described in the book dropped out of
high school and threatened suicide if she could not have
reconstructive surgery to make her a boy. Testing revealed
that she was intersexed, having male chromosomes and female
external genitalia. Id. at 212.

117. Id. The court examined the nature and
frequency of cases of intersexuality, the various medical
procedures considered acceptable by the medical community,
the urgency and necessity of the procedures, and the optimal
age at which surgery should be performed. Id. at 2. Finally,
the court looked at whether there were any studies showing
the beneficial or detrimental effects of surgery. Id. The
court stated that in response to its request for information
it had received numerous documents, most of which concurred.
Id. at 3. In the United States, Germany, and Colombia (up
until this point), surgery on the external genitalia is
performed as soon as possible after the birth of the infant,
usually within the first week. Id. at 4. The internal gonads
are generally removed during adolescence. Id. According to
medical experts, the surgery is done immediately so that the
parents will not raise their child without a clear gender
role. Id. Doctors also hope to prevent the child from
becoming confused about their gender and deciding to change
their assigned sex in the future. Id. When the ambiguity is
not discovered at birth, such as in the case of Ramos, the
child is usually assigned the gender that the parents have
raised him or her with thus far. Id. Proponents of the
surgery argue that if the child's genitals do not conform to
their social sex, their parents may feel uncomfortable with
the child's ambiguity. Id. at 5. In addition, the child may
be teased by their peers and develop low self-esteem or other
psychological problems. Id. In opposition to the surgery, the
court received an amicus brief from ISNA to which it often
references in its opinion. Id. See Intersex Society of North
America, ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery,
Nov. 7, 1998, available at http://isna.org/colombia/brief.html.
Critiques of the surgery include lack of informed consent by
parents, lack of long-term studies, and random choice of sex
assignment by doctors and parents. Ramos Summary, supra note 54, at 4. The court was not able to
locate any follow-up studies that had been done on the
effectiveness of these medical procedures. Id. The court
referred to the Nuremberg Code that prohibits research and
experimentation on human subjects without the individual's
consent. Id. at 6-7.

"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one
shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or
scientific experimentation." Id. art. 7. In Ramos, the
Colombian Constitutional Court explores the legal dilemma
created by the doctor's mandate to help the patient in
whatever way possible stemming from the benevolence principle
in Articles 44 and 49 of the Colombian Constitution; the
patient's right to have access to science and technology from
Articles 13 and 49 of the Constitution; versus the patient's
right to autonomy and physical integrity, from Articles 1,
12, 16 and 44. Ramos Summary, supra note
54, at 6. The court also mentions the advancement of
science that is encouraged by allowing doctors to develop new
techniques through experimentation without strict judicial
control. Id. The court states that these constitutional
principles may often be in contradiction. Id. The court's
decision is controlled by the principles of autonomy in
Article 1, and the preservation of the life and health of the
people in Articles 2 and 46. Id. at 7. Thus, the court
concludes that people must have more autonomy to consent to
procedures that are risky to their life and health. Id.; see

allowed the state to limit parent's power in this regard
stating, "Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves.
But it does not follow they are free, in identical
circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they
have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they

three categories: those where the child's death is imminent;
those where there is no imminent harm; and those where the
child is endangered but death is not imminent. Id. at 314-15.
In most cases, courts will interfere when death is imminent
and where the child is endangered even where death is not
imminent. However, when there is no risk of imminent death,
the parent's religious rights and privacy rights are weighed
against the state's parens patriae rights. Id. See also In re

188. Id.; see In re Guardianship of Hayes,
608 P.2d 635 (Wash. 1980) . In limited circumstances, parents
can consent for their incompetent children to be sterilized
to protect them from harmful pregnancies. Id. at 638.
However, there are strict procedural guidelines that the
court follows before allowing parental consent. Id. at 639.
The following guidelines must be followed: (1) the child must
be represented by a disinterested guardian ad litem; (2) the
child must be incapable of making her own decision about
sterilization; and (3) the child must be unlikely to develop
sufficiently to make an informed judgment about sterilization
in the foreseeable future. Id. at 641. Even after the court
establishes the listed criteria, the parent or guardian
seeking an incompetent's sterilization must prove by clear,
cogent, and convincing evidence that there is a need for
contraception. Id. First the judge must find that the
individual is physically capable of procreation. Id. Second
the judge must find that she is likely to engage in sexual
activity at the present or in the near future under
circumstances likely to result in pregnancy. Id. Finally the
judge must determine that the nature and extent of the
individual's disability, as determined by empirical evidence
and not solely on the basis of standardized tests, renders
him or her permanently incapable of caring for a child, even
with reasonable assistance. Id.
189. Reproductive rights will not be
infringed for those intersexed children who are incapable of
producing sperm or eggs or who do not have a functional
uterus.
190. Reproductive rights will also not be
infringed for intersexed children who have clitoral reduction
surgery and do not have their gonads or uterus removed.
191. Estate of CW, 640 A.2d at 427.
192. However, in Vermont, same-sex couples
may seek a civil union, pursuant to Vt. St T.15 § 1201 .
These civil unions may not be recognized by other states. See
William C. Duncan, Civil Unions in Vermont: Where to Go From
Here?, 11 WIDENER J. PUB. L. 361, 373-76 (2002) . In addition,
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held in Goodridge v.
Dep't of Public Health, that barring an individual from the
protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage
solely because that person would marry a person of the same
sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution and stayed the
judgment for 180 days to permit the Legislature to take
action. 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).

197. Lynn E. Harris, Born True Hermaphrodite,
at http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/BornHermaphrodite
(last visited Mar. 27, 2004). The Superior Court, County of
Los Angeles, granted the two-part request of Lynn Elizabeth
Harris, Case No. 437625, changing the name and legal sex on
her birth certificate from Lynn Elizabeth Harris to Lynn
Edward Harris, and from female to male, respectively.
Id.
198. See In re Estate of Gardiner, 22 P.3d
1086 (Kan. Ct. App. 2001) . Most court cases discussing the
legality of changing birth certificates, names or gender
identification only consider chromosomes as one factor in
determining a person's legal gender. Id. The main factor that
courts consider is the genitalia of the individual requesting
a legal change of status. Id. In this case involving a male
to female transsexual, the court discusses intersex
conditions extensively in explaining the difficulty in
determining legal gender. Id.
199. Burton, supra note
153, § IIIC. Burton cites Littleton v. Prange, 9
S.W.3d 223 (Tex. App. 1999). In Littleton v. Prange, a male
to female transsexual legally changed her birth certificate
to female and married. 9 S.W.3d at 224-25. However, the court
found that she was not a legal spouse because she was born
male and thus was unable to sue for the wrongful death of her
husband. Id. at 225-26.
200. Cruzan v. Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 269 (1990). "This notion of
bodily integrity has been embodied in the requirement that
informed consent is generally required for medical treatment.
Justice Cordozo, while on the Court of Appeals of New York,
aptly described this doctrine: Every Human being of adult
years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be
done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an
operation without his patient's consent commits an assault,
for which he is liable in damages." Id.

Association defines informed consent as "a basic social
policy for which exceptions are permitted: (1) where the
patient is unconscious or otherwise incapable of consenting
and harm from failure to treat is imminent; or (2) when risk
disclosure poses such a serious psychological threat of
detriment to the patient as to be medically contraindicated.
Social policy does not accept the paternalistic view that the
physician may remain silent because divulgence might prompt
the patient to forego needed therapy. Rational, informed
patients should not be expected to act uniformly, even under
similar circumstances, in agreeing to or refusing treatment."

practice of female genital mutilation is carried out by
members of certain cultural and religious groups within the
United States; (2) the practice of female genital mutilation
often results in the occurrence of physical and psychological
health effects that harm the women involved; (3) such
mutilation infringes upon the guarantees of rights secured by
Federal and State law, both statutory and constitutional; (4)
the unique circumstances surrounding the practice of female
genital mutilation place it beyond the ability of any single
State or local jurisdiction to control; (5) the practice of
female genital mutilation can be prohibited without abridging
the exercise of any rights guaranteed under the first
amendment to the Constitution or under any other law; and (6)

[hereinafter Nuremberg Code]; Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger
Institute, Inc. 782 A.2d 807 (2001) . This case discusses
experimental research on children in the United States
without informed consent. Id. at 811. The court in that case
stated, "The Nuremberg Code is the most complete and
authoritative statement of the law of informed consent to
human experimentation. It is also part of international
common law and may be applied, in both civil and criminal
cases, by state, federal and municipal courts in the United
States." Id. at 835 [internal quotations omitted]. The court
refers to the text of the Nuremberg Code to support its
conclusion that the consent to the research was invalid, "The
voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely
essential. This means that the person involved should have
legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to
be able to exercise free power of choice, without the
intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress,
over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or
coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and
comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved
as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened
