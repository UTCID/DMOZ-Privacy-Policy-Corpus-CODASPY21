1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service,
including any information you transmit to or through the Service. We use that information to
provide the Service’s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service’s quality,
engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage
of the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message
you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply
with legal obligations. Even when we do not retain such information, it still must be transmitted to
our servers initially and stored long enough to process.
Please also note:
Account Information: If you create a AncientFaces account, we may store and use the information you
provide during that process, such as your full name, email address, and other information you may
provide with your account, such as your gender and birth date. We may publicly display your first
and last name, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the registration process,
as part of your account profile. You can modify some of the information associated with your account
through your account settings. If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account
depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal by contacting us.
Public Content: Your contributions to the Service are intended for public consumption and are
therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, biographies, comments, favorites, and edits
to pages listed on AncientFaces. Your account profile (e.g., first name, last name, month joined,
profile photos, favorites, uploads and friends) is also intended for public consumption, as is some
of your other activity through the Service, such as how you favorite other people’s contributions,
what biographies and photos you upload, which users, biographies, surnames and photos you follow. You
can limit the public nature of some of these activities through your account settings.
Contacts: You can invite others to join AncientFaces by providing us with their contact information or
by allowing us to access your contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to
select which individuals you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we may transmit
that information to our servers long enough to process your invitations.
Communications: When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive
messages from other users, businesses, and AncientFaces. You can manage some of your messaging
preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain
administrative, transactional, or legal messages from AncientFaces. For example, if you upload photos
or create biographies through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the
contact information you provide. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive
from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you
exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver
them or allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations
related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages
that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages or fraudulent solicitations. We may also store
information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and
other electronic messages or in person.
Activity: We may store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages
you view, the date and time of your visit and uploads you make through the Service. We also may store
information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the Service,
such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information
such as SSID, unique device identifier, advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon based
location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs.
2. COOKIES
We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5
and Flash (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA
or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar technology ("Cookies") in connection with your use of the Service, third party
websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer
or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you and your use
of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been
displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored only
during an individual session.
The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:
Purpose
Explanation
Processes
Intended to make the Service work in the way you expect. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you
have already signed up for an account.
Authentication, Security, and Compliance
Intended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements. For
example, we use Cookies to determine if you are logged in.
Preferences
Intended to remember information about how you prefer the Service to behave and look. For example, we use a Cookie
that tells us whether you have declined to allow us to send push notifications to your phone.
Notifications
Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service.
For example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.
Advertising
Intended to make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. For example, we may use Cookies
to serve you interest-based ads, such as ads that are displayed to you based on your visits to other websites, or to
tell us if you have recently clicked on an ad.
Analytics
Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service.
For example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.
You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the
Service. The method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in your device or browser
preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of
ad tracking. For flash cookies, you can manage your privacy settings by clicking here. Please note that changing any of these
settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to you.
3. THIRD PARTIES
Third parties may receive information about you as follows:
Advertisers: We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Service to collect the same type of information for the
same purposes as we do. In doing so, we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online
Behavioral Advertising. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have
about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able
to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links:
Network Advertising Initiative,
Omniture
and Digital Advertising Alliance. Please note that opting out does not
prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from
or about you with third parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account
identifier (such as an email address) to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. You may be able to limit our sharing
of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or through the Service’s settings.
Service Providers:
We may rely on third party providers to support or provide some of the services that are available
through the Service, such as email delivery with Mailchimp and analytics tracking with Google Analytics. We may also rely on
third party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your use of the Service, such as communications and
hosting services, network security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing,
our own marketing of the Service, and other functions. We may share information from or about you with these third party providers
so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third party providers may share information with us that
they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third party providers may
also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control. Some of our web pages
utilize framing techniques to serve content to you from our third party providers, while preserving the look and feel of the Service.
In such cases, please note that the information you provide is being provided to the third party.
Aggregate or Anonymous Information: We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as affiliates
that are advertised on AncientFaces and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been
exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements. We may also disclose anonymized information about your use on AncientFaces, for
example if you engage in uploading photos and biographies on AncientFaces, we may publicly disclose information about the
quantity of photos and biographies without providing identifying information about you or otherwise disclosing your participation
in the process.
Business Transfers: We may share information from or about you with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures,
or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company
acquires AncientFaces, or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will
assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Investigations and Legal Disclosures: We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good
faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement
instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law
enforcement requests served on us; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with
the Service; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. If you flag or
otherwise complain to us about content through the Service, we may share the substance of your complaint with the contributor of
that content in order to provide an opportunity for the contributor to respond.
Links: The Service may link to third party services, like a business’s URL, or other websites. Except as set forth herein,
we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read
the privacy policies on or applicable to all such third party services.
Third Party Accounts: If you sign up for, or log into, AncientFaces using a third party service like Facebook, or link
your AncientFaces account to your account with a third party service like Facebook, we may receive information about you from
such third party service. If you post content to a third party service through the Service, that third party service will also
receive that content, which will be visible to anyone that has access to it through that third party service.
4. CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, from your account profile and if you include personal
information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service pseudonymously,
though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service. Please note that the messages you send or receive
using the Service are only private to the extent that both you and the person you are communicating with keep them private. For example,
if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it. Also, we may access and disclose such messages in the
course of investigations relating to use of the Service.
5. DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION
You can close your account by contacting us. We will remove all or a portion of
all uploads you have added to AncientFaces and certain public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but
we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we
may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with
legal obligations. Please note that businesses cannot remove their business listings, ratings, or reviews by closing their accounts.
6. CHILDREN
The Service is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please
contact us here. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with
personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.
7. SECURITY
We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However,
no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we
strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
8. CONTACT
You may contact us online concerning our Privacy Policy, or write to us at the
following address:
AncientFaces, Attn: Data Privacy Manager
65 Washington Street
Santa Clara, California 95050
9. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our collection, use,
and disclosure of information about you and will be located on
https://www.ancientfaces.com/content/privacy. If we make material changes to this
Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on the Service prior to the effective date of the changes. By
continuing to access or use the Service after those changes become effective, you acknowledge the revised Privacy Policy.
10. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you
unless you first agree to such disclosure. If you have any questions regarding this policy, or would like to change your preferences,
