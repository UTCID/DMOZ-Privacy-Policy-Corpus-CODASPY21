A Message from Dr. Harry Schaumburg
Cybersex, in all forms of illicit sex from chat rooms to pornography, is a perfect metaphor for life without God in a dramatic attempt to circumvent a life of relational pain. Everything seems real in the illusion, but the meaning is lost in the masquerade of self-satisfaction. There is something that is truly missing.
