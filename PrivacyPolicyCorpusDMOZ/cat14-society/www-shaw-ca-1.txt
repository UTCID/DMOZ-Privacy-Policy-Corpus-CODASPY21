Collection and Use of Television Set-Top Box Data: Certain digital set-top boxes used by Customers who subscribe for video services, and the BLUECURVE TV mobile app, automatically collect raw household tuning data (the "Tuning Data"). Tuning Data is used for billing purposes, diagnostic purposes, for the tuning of recommendation engines and to measure television viewership. Shaw creates a database of anonymized and/or aggregated viewing behaviour by pairing Tuning Data with non-sensitive information in Customer files. This helps Shaw understand Customer reactions to television content and advertising. The collection of Tuning Data is critical to operating our video services and cannot be disabled. However, you can choose to opt-out of Shaw's use of Tuning Data in an anonymized and aggregated database by using the process described in Subsection 3.3 below. You can also disable the delivery of recommendations via your set-top-box settings.

In certain instances, Shaw will rely on a third party to deliver Shaw Go WiFi services at a specified location (for example, certain airports, universities or other locations). The relationship with the third party is governed by strict privacy provisions, in compliance with PIPEDA. As part of the delivery of the Shaw Go WiFi services, the third party may have access to the Device Information, which can only be used for limited network monitoring and improvement purposes.

Cookies tell Shaw which pages of its websites are visited and how many people visited each web page. This helps Shaw understand consumer interests and enhance the on-line experience of visitors to the Shaw websites. Cookies also serve to identify your computer so that your preferences can be saved for future visits and advertising based on your previous interaction with the site, Shaw works with third parties that use these cookies to help us with such traffic management, research and analytic.
The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major browsers are initially set up to accept them. You can reset your browser to either refuse to accept all cookies or to notify you when you have received a cookie. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on Shaw's websites. Third Party Cookies and Advertisements: Some of the advertisements you see on the Shaw websites are delivered by third party advertisers, Internet advertising companies that work on Shaw's behalf or ad networks. These third parties may use cookies or other technology to help deliver ads that are tailored to your interests and track their performance. This is commonly known as "behavioural" or "interest-based advertising" You can opt-out of several third party ad servers' and networks' cookies simultaneously using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

3.3 How does Shaw obtain your consent?
Consent is generally required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or disclosure of the Personal Information. Consent can be either express or implied. The form of consent sought by Shaw may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information. In determining the form of consent to use, Shaw takes into account the sensitivity of the information and your reasonable expectation, so that you understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal Information. Shaw generally seeks express consent when the Personal Information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is typically appropriate when the Personal Information is less sensitive. Business Contact Information can be used by Shaw without consent solely for the purpose of facilitating communication between Shaw and an employee, in relation to his/her employment, business or profession. In addition, in exceptional circumstances, as permitted by law, Shaw may collect, use and/or disclose Personal Information without a Customer’s, Employee’s or Web Site User's knowledge or consent. Consent may be obtained in any one of the following ways: a. an application form may be used to seek consent, collect Personal Information and inform the Customer of the use that will be made of the Personal Information. By completing and signing the form, the Customer is giving consent to the collection and the specified uses; b. check-off box may be used to allow the Customer to request that their names and addresses are not given to other organizations. Customers who do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of their information to third parties; c. orally when information is collected over the telephone; or d. at the time a Customer uses a product or service. In general, the use of products and services by a Customer, or a Web Site User's use of a Shaw website, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, will constitute implied consent required by Shaw to collect, use and/or disclose Personal Information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. Consent may be withdrawn by Customers, Employees and Web Site Users at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and upon providing Shaw reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent to certain collection, retention, use or disclosure of Personal Information, please contact Shaw at shaw.privacy@sjrb.ca. Please note that if you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service. We will explain the impact on you at the time, to help you with your decision.

3.5 Who does Shaw share Personal Information with?
Shaw does not sell Personal Information about its Customers, Employees and/or Web Site Users. Shaw may share Customers' Personal Information with its partners, associates and third party service providers as provided in Subsection 3.4, in order to fulfill the purposes identified in Subsection 3.2. In such cases, the relationship with the partner, associate or third party is governed by strict confidentiality standards and policies to ensure the Customer's Personal Information is secure and treated in accordance with PIPEDA and with the utmost care and respect. Except as required or permitted by law, when disclosure is made to a third party other than a Shaw partner or associate, or a third party service provider, the consent of the individual shall be obtained and reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure that any such third party has Personal Information privacy procedures and policies in place that are comparable to those implemented by Shaw. Such third parties are provided only with such information as is necessary in the circumstances. Personal Information provided to third parties may be used only for the purpose stipulated and is subject to strict terms of confidentiality. In the event that a third party service provider is located in a foreign country, Customer and Employee Personal Information may be processed and stored in such other foreign country. In such circumstances, the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that country may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information through the laws of the foreign country. Whenever Shaw engages a third party service provider, we require that its privacy and security standards adhere to this Privacy Policy and applicable Canadian privacy legislation.
3.6 How does Shaw safeguard your Personal Information?
The nature of the safeguards varies depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information, the scope of the Personal Information, and the method of storage of that information. More sensitive types of Personal Information will be safeguarded by a higher level of protection, including encryption. Personal Information is predominantly stored in Canada and the United States, under strict confidentiality standards, as per Section 3.5. Data is routed domestically and may be routed outside of Canada for service provision purposes as described in Section 3.5.
3.7 How long does Shaw retain your Personal Information?
We retain your personal information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it has been collected. Our general retention guideline is a 7-year period, which extends to all our corporate records including our customer & billing database. This allows us to meet our financial accountability and SOX audit obligations. Outside of the 7-year period, retention is defined based on length of time information is needed to meet the purpose(s) for which it has been collected and takes into account the sensitivity of the personal information. For example, we keep records of IP address leases for 1 year after a lease expires, while shaw.ca email mailbox contents are not kept more than 60 days after an account is closed.
3.8 How do I access Shaw's policies and procedures?
Shaw makes available to Customers, Employees and Web Site Users specific information about its policies and procedures relating to the management of Personal Information, on our corporate and community websites.

4. Your role in protecting your Personal Information
Please remember that Shaw's Privacy Policy and our use of your Personal Information only applies to the information you provide. We caution that if you disclose Personal Information or personally sensitive data through use of the Internet such as through chat rooms, communities, bulletin boards or other public online forums, this information is not collected by or for Shaw but may be collected and used by other persons or companies over which Shaw has no control. It is your responsibility to review the privacy statements of any person or company to whom you choose to link, from or through the use of any Shaw Internet services. Shaw is not responsible for privacy statements, privacy compliance or other content of any website not owned or managed by Shaw or its affiliate companies. Shaw does its best to protect and safeguard Personal Information and we believe there are safeguards you should take as well. Do not share your Personal Information such as bank card numbers, credit card numbers, associated pin numbers or Social Insurance numbers unless you clearly understand the purpose of the request and you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Information in your email inbox or on Webmail. Provide Shaw with one acceptable piece of identification, pin number or passphrase, that will be kept in your Customer account, so we can identify you when you call Shaw. If you are asked to assign passwords to connect you to your Personal Information, you should use a combination of letters (upper and lowercases), numbers and symbols and do not use words that can be easily associated with you (example: do not use the name of a family member or pet). We also suggest you change your password regularly. If you are suspicious of any telephone, mail or email promotional campaigns or you suspect fraudulent activity, please contact us at shaw.privacy@sjrb.ca to verify that the campaign is a legitimate Shaw activity.
