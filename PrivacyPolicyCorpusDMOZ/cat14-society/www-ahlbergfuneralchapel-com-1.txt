About
The Ahlberg family has served Colorado’s Front Range communities—Longmont, Boulder County, Larimer County, Weld County—since the founding of Ahlberg Funeral Chapel in 1958. For three generations, the Ahlbergs have been part of Longmont, providing dedication and personal attention to families from all walks of life. Whether you’re planning a simple cremation, a full traditional burial service or a modern celebration of life, Ahlberg Funeral Chapel is here to listen and fulfill your wishes.
A caring Longmont funeral home
When Rodney A. Ahlberg purchased our red brick building on Terry Street in 1963 and converted it from a church to a mortuary, he made every effort to retain its natural beauty and brightness. Through the years, we’ve been careful to ensure that modern touches blend well with the original architecture. Many people comment that Ahlberg Funeral Chapel is a comforting place to host their loved ones’ remembrance services. There’s also plenty of parking: our side lot, between our main building and the historic Callahan House; our main parking lot, across the street from our building; and overflow spaces in the Elks Club parking lot, southeast of our building.
Ahlberg Funeral Chapel offers families numerous options when planning a reception before or after a service. You may host a reception at our chapel or choose to hold an event at the historic Callahan House next door, where families have use of the home and its gardens. The nearby Elks Club offers ample space and catering services for a worry-free reception. We can also work to arrange a reception at the location of your choosing. No event is too small or too large for our resourceful and caring planners. We can plan and provide a service for any number of guests.
Guiding you every step of the way
The team at Ahlberg Funeral Chapel embraces traditional values, diversity and innovation in honoring the spirit and life of each loved one in a highly personalized way. We offer a full range of funeral and cremation services. We are here to:
Help you design a fitting tribute that honors the memory, achievements and experiences of your loved one.
Assist you in selecting the most appropriate products, including a casket, burial vault, cremation urn, cemetery plot or mausoleum, to fit your budget and suit personal preferences and family traditions.
Help you write a fitting obituary and assist in getting it published in the newspapers of your choice.
Prepare all paperwork, including vital record statistics and permits; take care of filing and obtaining death certificates; and assist with veteran’s benefits and Social Security claims.
Create a online memorial where your family and friends can archive treasured photos and memories.
Provide an elegant hearse and funeral cars, as well as arrange for escorts, if you wish.
Help in the selection and on-site arrangement of floral tributes.
Support you even after services are over with grief education and a referral to our counseling service.
We take care of every detail, so that you can spend your time remembering and healing with family and friends.
Planning in advance
We know that making funeral arrangements and handling the associated expenses can be overwhelming. In addition to assisting during an immediate time of need, our funeral directors specialize in working with families to plan final arrangements in advance. By preparing these details ahead of time, you help protect your loved ones and provide peace of mind. You’ll also lock in today’s prices and avoid future price increases, which can help ease your family’s financial burden during an already stressful time.
As part of the Dignity Memorial® network, we offer a selection of unmatched services. They include the following and much more:
Relocation Protection.* When you have a pre-paid plan with a Dignity Memorial provider and wish to transfer the plan to another location more than 75 miles away, every detail of your plan moves with you. All of our pre-paid plans are transferable and will be honored by any of the qualifying Dignity Memorial providers in North America. That’s a promise you won’t find anywhere else.
Purchase Protection Plan.* Should you pass away before your purchased cemetery property is fully paid for, your family will receive some financial relief. Our Purchase Protection Plan will help take care of any remaining balance due to the cemetery. Purchaser must be under 65 years of age; maximum forgiven balance not to exceed $5,000.
100 percent guaranteed satisfaction. Our goal is to provide you with the absolute best service possible. If there’s something we can do better before, during or after a service, we want you to tell us.
*Certain restrictions apply.
Call us day or night
Whether you have an immediate need or are planning in advance, please know that you can turn to us for compassionate care and impeccable service. Our pledge is to honor your loved one and family with dignity, respect and attention to every detail. Our knowledgeable team is ready to help you with affordable arrangements 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Arrangements can be made in person or by phone or email, so please don’t hesitate to contact us and find out why so many families in the Longmont area choose Ahlberg Funeral Chapel for their funeral and cremation needs.
History
When Rodney Ahlberg Sr. opened Ahlberg Funeral Chapel in 1958, he realized his dream of developing his gift of helping people cope through trying times. He instilled his passion and values into the following generations of his family, who remain dedicated to delivering the same high quality of service, care and compassion.
Rodney Sr. served in North Africa and Italy during World War II. He returned to Longmont, Colorado, after the war and met Corrine Brown, who would become his wife and business partner. Rodney Sr. and Corrine started their company in the basement of the First United Methodist Church, where it was located until 1963, when they were able to purchase the current building from the Seventh-Day Adventist Church.
The funeral home is still located at that Terry Street address. We joined the Dignity Memorial network in 2020.

"Service was exactly as expected.
No surprises."

"I was blown away by the price list! It was extremely hard to figure how much I was going to owe.
Maybe reword:
Basic cremation = $1500 Urn.
400 Basic viewing.
400
Or whatever the prices are.
I felt like I was going to owe the pkg on the front page plus the basic cremation. Just extremely confusing.
My only comment about the whole process was our nice lady we dealt with seemed totally uncomfortable in my first meeting with her. My mother-in-law was present and it seemed she was trying so so so hard to be 'correct' in all aspects of presenting things to us, that she came across as very flustered. My meetings with her after that were much better. I apologize that she may have been uncomfortable with that first meeting!!"

"1. Charles Came to get my Mom in less than 1/2 Hour from my call. Sat with us and let us ask any questions we wanted.
2. Charles made Mom look so beautiful with clothes, makeup and her hair. He really listened to detail and followed through.
3. Torre listened to every word, kept great notes and followed through on every detail we mentioned.
4. Ty (?) was so gentle and welcoming. He made us all feel at ease at the viewing.
5. Torre guided us through each step. Grave side was perfect because he let us do it our way but he helped guide us to get it done.
6. Young Lady from Estes Park - of course her name slips my mind - She was equally as gracias when I went back to pick up death certificate. Sat with me and made sure I knew that if I had any more questions that they were there for us. 7. Even an additional viewing time was arranged the early morning for my brother who had arrived too late for the official viewing."
