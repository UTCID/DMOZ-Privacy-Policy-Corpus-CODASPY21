I take your privacy seriously. The personal information you entrust to me is not for sale. I will not share it with anyone, for any reason, unless you specifically authorize me to do so.
The information I collect and store consists solely of what you voluntarily provide. If you choose to subscribe to e-mail updates from this site, I will use your name and e-mail address to keep you informed. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in any email you receive from this site.
My hosting server company automatically collects traffic statistics for this site, which I can view at any time. All of this information is anonymous.
This site links to other sites that are beyond the scope of this privacy policy. While I would never knowingly link to a site that does not respect the privacy of its visitors, I cannot be responsible for the practices of any site except my own.
When it comes to security, I must add a cautionary note. There is always a possibility that information disclosed online can be intercepted and used. Should this happen, I cannot be responsible.
Stay up-to-date with Rona.
To see what’s on my mind these days, friend me on Facebook.
