It is said that it takes a village to raise a child. In our case, it takes a community to help a family stay at the Ronald McDonald House. When you visit your local McDonald’s Restaurant, you will see a donation box on the drive thru similar to this one. With your donation, the Ronald McDonald House is able to provide a home-away-from-home to families who have children in the hospital. So remember, no donation is too small. Please support our Valley families. Little by little, a penny, a dime, or a quarter can add up.
