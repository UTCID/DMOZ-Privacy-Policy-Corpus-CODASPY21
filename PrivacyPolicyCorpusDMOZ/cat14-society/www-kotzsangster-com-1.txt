Kotz Sangster Wysocki P.C. will use personally identifiable information only for that specific purpose for which you submitted it, except that we may use the information that we obtain from this site in an aggregated form, such as to measure the usefulness and popularity of our site.
A “cookie” is a small text file generated by a Web site’s server and placed on a user’s hard drive. Cookies enable the site and your browser to interact in such a way that the site is able to present you with the most appropriate options and to customize services to your interests, based on your previous use of the Web site. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of the site so that you do not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area.
Because the early uses of cookies to track users’ navigational habits were not disclosed to users, their use has raised significant privacy concerns. However, most Web sites now use cookies to improve your navigational experiences. The Kotz Sangster Wysocki P.C. web site does not currently use cookies; however, we may decide to use them in the future.
Your browser is probably set to accept cookies; however, if you are concerned about cookies, most browsers now recognize when a cookie is offered, and permit you to opt-out of receiving it. The “help” function on most browsers will have information on how to prevent your computer from accepting cookies, how to find out if you have received a cookie, and how to disable them completely, if this is what you want to do. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of Web sites that use cookies will not function properly when you view them.
