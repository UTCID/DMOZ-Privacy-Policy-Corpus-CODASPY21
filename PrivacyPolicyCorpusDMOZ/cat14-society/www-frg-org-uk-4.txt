About Family Rights Group
We are the charity in England and Wales that advises families whose children are involved with or need children's services because of welfare needs or concerns. We develop and promote policies and practices that help to secure the best possible outcomes for children and families and that help children to be raised safely and securely within their families. We also campaign for effective support to assist family and friends carers, including grandparents raising children who cannot live at home.
In this policy we use "family" to mean parents and family members of a child involved with children's services, and children and young people.
What would we like you to do?
We invite you to get involved with Family Rights Group. There are different ways families can do this, for example:
Give us feedback about the service we have provided. This could be a suggestion on how we can improve, criticism or something you like. You can find out more from our Complaints and Compliments policy.
Respond to surveys or requests for being interviewed or take part in a focus group, for example on a specific issue such as being a carer in Lambeth.
Take part in a Parents' Panel or Family and Friends Carers' Panel. Speak about your experiences at a conference, or run a training session or lead a workshop.
Participate in lobbying and campaigning, for example emailing/contacting decision makers, attending meetings, speaking at events
Consider being involved in the running of the Charity and its activities, by being a member of a project advisory group or applying to become a trustee.
What can we offer you?
We will respect and value your contribution.
Prior to your being invited to participate, we will make it clear to you whether any expenses or payments are applicable.
If expenses payments are applicable we will pay them in line with our Involvement - Payment and Expenses policy for families. This will include any pre-agreed travel expenses by public transport and any pre-agreed out of pocket expenses. You can find out more in our Involvement - Payment and Expenses policy.
We will give you a named member of staff to support you in getting involved, including any preparation and to write up your involvement for your c.v. if appropriate.
We will respect your confidentiality. There are exceptional circumstances when we might have to pass information on – you can find out more in our Confidentiality policy.
We will always let you know what difference your involvement has made. For example, we will send you any reports that include your ideas or experiences, and tell you what we have done about any suggestions you have made about Family Rights Group.
We will respond to any complaints or suggestions normally within 10 working days. You can find out more from our Complaints and Compliments policy.
Our principles for getting families involved:
We want families to be at the heart of our work, and welcome whatever level of involvement is right for them individually. Their involvement could be feedback, consultation, participation in the design and delivery of projects and services, campaigning/lobbying, or governance of FRG.
Families have the right to be treated with dignity and respect at all times.
We will consult families about how they want to be involved with Family Rights Group.
We are committed to equal opportunities for everyone and welcome involvement from all families regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation. You can find out more from our equal opportunities policy.
We respect families' right to make informed decisions about whether or how they wish to be involved.
When consulting families about our services or on behalf of someone else, we will ensure they know the purpose and the outcome of the consultation.
We will include family involvement in all our project plans and funding applications as appropriate, and we will take account of the time and resources needed as part of our planning.
We will ensure that budgets for conferences include an allowance for free places for families.
We aim to include family members on the Trustee Board and will provide appropriate support for this role.
We will review this policy and how it is working in practice once a year, including asking families who have been involved what they think.
