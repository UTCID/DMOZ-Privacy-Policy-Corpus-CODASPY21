Terms of Use
Overview
Stonebriar Community Church (SCC) is a non-profit organization.
This Privacy Policy covers SCCs treatment of personally identifiable information (Personal Data) that SCC gathers when its users access (view) and use the Web Site and when they use content and/or services on the Web Site. SCC knows that people (users) care about how their personal information is used and shared. We take your privacy just as seriously. So, please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of SCC and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
Information Collected Through the Site
We collect Personal Data through the Site when you voluntarily chose to provide us with Personal Data, through one or more of the following options:
Personal Data:
Registration – Our Site’s registration system may require individuals(users) to give us various Personal Data, including contact information such as their name and e-mail address, and demographic information such as a ZIP code, sex, or age. Such contact information is used to contact the user when necessary.
Surveys and Questionnaires – Any online surveys and questionnaires may ask individuals for contact and demographic information. The individuals contact information is used to contact the user when necessary.
Newsletters/RSS Feeds – Individuals may also choose to subscribe (opt-in) or to unsubscribe (opt-out) to newsletters or RSS feed on this website. This is further explained in the choice/opt-in or opt-out sections below.
Other Information:
Demographics – We receive and store certain types of information whenever individuals interact with our Site. SCC automatically receives and records information on our server logs from individuals browser including IP addresses, SCC cookie information, and the page requested. Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. SCC only uses this data in aggregate form. This as a statistical measure and would identify a user personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often people access parts of the Site so that we can make the Site appealing to as many people as possible, and improve the content. This information will not be shared with advertisers and other third parties.
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While SCC will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
IP Addresses – An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Through the Site, we collect IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct Site analysis. If someone requests pages from the Site, our servers enter the visitor’s IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing Personal Data. However, we will use IP addresses to identify any user who refuses to comply with our in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify users who threaten our service, Site, customers, advertisers or others.
Cookies – Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that a Web site transfers to an individual’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. Our Site uses cookies during your online session to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies allow us to customize your other message repeatedly. Our cookies do not collect or contain Personal Data. They do enable us to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to our Site. SCC does not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Data that would reveal the identity of a user, his/her user or screen name or email address.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Sites most attractive features.

Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the certain services available through the Site, we will use your Personal Data to provide access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

Our Disclosure of your Personal Data and Other Information
SCC is not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you and will not disclose your Personal Data to a third party except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: SCC, like many Churches, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing online givings. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide it with the information that it needs to perform its specific function and require that it keeps your Personal Data confidential and only uses it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Legal Requirements: SCC may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of SCC, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Data may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
External Links
In order to provide users with greater value, our Site may provide links to various third party websites. However, even if a third-party affiliation exists between the Site and that destination site, we do not exercise authority over these linked sites, each of which maintains independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. We do not assume responsibility or liability for these independent methods or actions and are not responsible for the independent policies or procedures of destination sites. We also cannot take responsibility for the privacy initiatives or the content of such web sites. These links to third party web sites are provided only for your convenience, and as such, you access them at your own risk.
However, we wish to ensure the integrity of the Site and its destination links, so any comments pertaining to the Site or any Sites accessed through these links are greatly appreciated.
Linking Your Website To Our Pages
We encourage you to link to our pages. However, we ask that you abide by the following guidelines when doing so:
You may not infer or imply that the Stonebriar Community Church sponsors or in any way approves of your site or any other site.
You may not frame, display, or alter any material from our web sites, or our web pages directly, in any way that obscures our identification, banners or site navigation. Framing does not allow users to bookmark the framed page. Also, some sites use frames to present content belonging to another site as if it was their own. We feel this is confusing to users and jeopardizes the integrity of our content. The presentation of the material linked to must make it readily apparent that the content is the property of Stonebriar Community Church or its affiliates.

We have implemented procedures to ensure that if we obtain actual knowledge of a child’s personal information we will take steps to delete that information.
