Emergency calls continue to come into 911 dispatch centers, but this week, the Sacramento Police Department's emergency lines have slowed, giving officers an opportunity to spend more time with some callers.One call came from an elderly man who ran out of food.Sacramento Police Dispatch Supervisor Kelly Joy is one of 77 dispatchers that continue to show up for work amid the coronavirus outbreak. While fielding emergency calls, Joy said dispatchers are also getting unique requests. "We received a call from an elderly gentleman in the community advising that he had been without food and had very limited supplies," Joy said.The elderly man told the dispatcher he's only been eating lentils.
The dispatcher asked him, "So, all you have is beans left?""Yeah," he replied.The man told the dispatcher, who wants to remain anonymous, he didn't have much money.
He was waiting for a check and didn't know when that check was coming.
The dispatcher then asked him, "Do you have any milk, bread, eggs, anything?""No, I don't have no bread or milk," he replied.The dispatcher thought she had to find a way to help this man."She has a huge heart," Joy said about her employee.
"She volunteers her off-duty time at her church's food kitchen. So, (she thought) why not help convince the sergeant?The dispatcher reached out to the police sergeant in the man's neighborhood and convinced him to stop by the caller's home."They were able to coordinate and get (the man) some groceries," Joy said. "They found some funds to purchase groceries, but once they got to the Grocery Outlet, Grocery Outlet -- even kinder -- turned and donated the groceries and even more than we were hoping to get."Joy said the number of emergency calls dispatched last week
were down by about 300 compared to the first two weeks of March. She credits that to people remaining at home and staying out of trouble.Some of the callers' questions she said have been odd, including "How long am I supposed to wash my hands for?" Other callers want to give advice."They're more so calling us to let us know how to take care of ourselves," Joy said. "One of the recommendations we got is to eat local honey."The Sacramento Police Department wants to thank Grocery Outlet for donating the groceries. They said they don't typically supply groceries to the people in the community, but if you have an in-progress emergency, call 911.
For non-emergency issues, use the 311 service line, police said.
