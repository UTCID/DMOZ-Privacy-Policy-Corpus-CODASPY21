Today's Christian Woman Reprint Permission Policy
We can grant permission for any original article (not a book excerpt) to be photocopied for ministerial or educational purposes. (Sunday-school classrooms, church newsletters, free workshop handouts, etc.). This permission is granted with the understanding that no more than 1,000 copies will be made, the material is distributed free of charge, and that the following credit line appears on each manufactured copy:
"This article first appeared on TodaysChristianWoman.com. Used by permission of Christianity Today, Carol Stream, IL 60188."
This Reprint Permission Policy applies to English reprints only. For Foreign Rights policies and permissions, please contact us.
Christianity Today does not grant permission for our articles to appear on a non-CT online site.
Downloadable Training Tools
You can make up to 1,000 copies of these materials, provided they are used in your local church only and they are distributed without charge (including tuition or an entrance fee). If a credit line doesn't appear on the copy, please insert the following:
Copyright {Insert Year} {Insert author's name} and Christianity Today /TodaysChristianWoman.com. Used with permission.
Some of our downloadable tools are in Microsoft Word so you can customize them to fit your needs: Add or delete questions, include the date or your church logo, or use only certain handouts or slides. You are not permitted to change the content, however. Doing so would violate the agreements that allow us to provide content.
We also provide permission for brief excerpts from downloads appearing on TodaysChristianWoman.com to be used in your e-mail newsletter, provided fewer than 50 words from the specific handout are included in the e-mail and it includes a link to that item on TodaysChristianWoman.com.
Sorry, but we are not able to grant permission for our training tools to appear on a non-Christianity Today website.
For any other use, advance permission must be obtained from the author. Please contact us at the following:
