Court Reporting Guidance
This guidance addresses the use of court reporting and electronic sound recording methods in keeping the record in the federal courts.  While each federal court administers its reporting services locally, there are certain requirements established by statute and by the Judicial Conference of the United States that all courts must fulfill.
