The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Privacy program is based on the Privacy Act of 1974, as implemented by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-130, the E-Government Act of 2002, and NRC policies. The objective of the Program is to balance the information requirements and operational needs of the NRC against the privacy interests of the individual.
The NRC is committed to protecting individual privacy and securing the personal information made available to us when you visit NRC.gov or visit NRC web pages hosted by other sites (such as our official profiles on social networking sites).
