Terms and Conditions
To see our privacy policy, click here
Please read these terms and conditions of use carefully before using the Web site.
By using this Website, you signify your assent to these terms of use. If you do not agree to Lawline.com’s, a division of FurtherEd, Inc. (hereinafter “Lawline”) terms of use, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these terms at any time. Please check these terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
Member Account
If you register as a user of this Website, you will be assigned a username and password that is unique to you. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password, and responsible for all activities that occur under your username and password. You agree to notify Lawline of any unauthorized use of your username and password or any other breach of security at support@lawline.com.
Privacy
Registration data and certain other demographic information about you are subject to Lawline's privacy policy. For more information, see our privacy policy, which is incorporated in full herein by reference.
Subscriptions
Lawline has 3 tiers of Subscriptions: 1) Basic; 2) Unlimited; and 3) Premium.  Basic Tier members have access to a limited number of on-demand courses, unlimited credits and all subscription standard features.  Unlimited Tier members have access to an expanded offering of  on-demand courses, live webcasts, new content added weekly, advanced courses, their own Lawline Public Profile and directory listing, access to New York “Bridge the Gap” events, unlimited credits and all subscription standard features.  Premium Tier members have access to everything in the Unlimited Tier plus 504 loan closing courses and packages.  Members in all tiers can claim CLE credit for any states that are available for a specific course at the time of course completion. Please note that credit states vary by course. Each member's terms of service are defined at the time of enrollment and CLE members must have active memberships to view on-demand programs and live webcasts.
Automatic Renewals
All subscription tiers automatically renew one year from the purchase date and every year thereafter with the credit card used in the initial purchase. Members are responsible for updating their credit card information. .
Cancellation Policy
Customers that enroll in a Lawline automatic renewal can cancel at any time by logging into their Lawline Account and choosing to cancel auto-renew. Upon cancellation, no future payments will be processed. Subscribers that cancel auto-renew can continue to use the subscription until one year after the purchase date, but will have to repurchase upon expiration.
Courses
All courses purchased in CLE Bundles or individually can be accessed for a one (1) year period from the date of purchase.
Course Expiration Dates
Due to differing rules and regulations in each state for accreditation of CLE courses, some courses will expire for different states at different times. To be sure that you are taking courses before their accreditation has expired in your state, first make sure your state is listed as an approved state for that CLE course. For both video and audio formats, when you begin the video course or download the MP3, a notification will come up within 10 days notifying you of the course’s expiration date.
Lawline has a policy that if one of our users purchased a course that expired before credit was received, we will switch that course for another of equal or lesser value for no charge. However, it is important for the user to be aware of which courses are expiring and to take the necessary actions to complete the course before the date of expiration. Lawline is not responsible for any actions taken against the individual for failure to complete required CLE credits on time because of an expiration issue.
Members Can Only Receive Credit One (1) Time for Each Course
Members can only receive CLE credit one time for each CLE course. Therefore if you take the same course in two separate reporting periods, you will only receive credit the first time you complete the program.
Fees and Payments
You shall pay all fees and charges incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to the use of the Website through your account.
You will provide us with a valid and updated form of payment that is acceptable to us. Forms of payment include credit card. If you can only pay in a currency other than US dollars, we will generate an invoice based on the current exchange rate and the invoice will be valid for net 10 days.
Refund Policy
At Lawline, we're proud to offer the highest quality CLE products on the market. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your Lawline experience, contact us within thirty days of your purchase for a refund or product exchange.
At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our credit/refund policy, we reserve the right to ban your account and to restrict all future use of the Services. Completing excessive courses for CLE credit before requesting a refund may constitute abuse of the policy.
Live Webcast or Event Cancellation/Postponement
If a live webcast or event must be postponed or cancelled for any reason, including inclement weather, every effort will be made to notify registrants via phone number or email address. If an event is to be rescheduled, all registrants will be notified of the new course date. You will have the option to (1) attend the course at the new time, or (2) request that your entire course fee be credited toward a different live or self-study course. Note, no refunds will be granted for live courses that are rescheduled due to inclement weather.
Additionally, if a live course for which you have registered is cancelled, you will be notified by e-mail and your entire tuition will be refunded.
Limitations on Reporting Fees
All subscription memberships, including "Lifetime Learner," include attendance reporting fees for any pre-approved programs to satisfy the state’s credit requirements per reporting cycle, plus any carryover credits earned. The following states are included: Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, and Tennessee.
Attorneys in Illinois should be advised that they are required to report their own attendance hours to the CLE Board and pay any associated fees. In Hawaii, Lawline will report a maximum of 3 credit hours per year and the associated attendance fees.  In Washington, Lawline will report Live Webcast credits only. Washington attorneys are responsible for self-reporting their attendance of On Demand programs, and are responsible for any associated attendance fees for Live Webcasts and On Demand programs.  North Carolina attorneys are required to pay a reporting fee of $3.50 per credit to the North Carolina State Bar. Lawline reports attorneys' credits to North Carolina, but each attorney is responsible for the aforementioned reporting fee(s).
