Protecting Your Information
MAP takes reasonable precautions to protect our users' information and is certified to be Trustwave-PCI compliant per the attached certificate.

We use an external service to provide real-time reporting to us and our authorized agents of browser accesses to our site. This reporting includes page views, unique views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information.

We use cookies on our site to personalize the experience of our visitors and to support some necessary functions. We also use cookies to better understand how our visitors use our site. You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

Communicating With You
MAP International partner organizations maintain several e-mail lists to keep our supporters, the press and policy makers informed about news and events.
Individuals who provide optional information may also receive materials in the U.S. mail and/or be contacted by telephone by MAP International. In addition, we do not share the personal information on our lists with staff outside of MAP partner organizations and their authorized agents. We configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the personal information of our list subscribers to anyone but authorized MAP partner organization staff and agents. Only MAP partner organization staff and our authorized agents have access to personally identifiable information provided by our donors and partners.
Protecting Children
Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our site to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.
It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the notification, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please contact us.
Maintaining Security
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving financial data from our site. In addition, we have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss or misuse of information at our site that we have collected from you.
A History of Trust
Since our founding we have been known as an organization that delivers quality medicines to those in need with remarkably low overhead.
For donors like you, this means we do the most good with each dollar you give.
In 2019, we helped over 13 million people by providing millions of healing doses of medicines. We did this all with a staff of fewer than 50 people in our U.S offices and warehouse.
We are able to deliver so much medicine at low cost because pharmaceutical companies donate many of the products we send overseas.
These are unexpired medicines that are desperately needed by people in many parts of the world. We also purchase medicines when necessary to meet specific needs.
We find MAP International to be professionally managed and a leader in their industry. MAP ranks in the top 5 percent of our clients in quality of financial reporting, management & board leadership.”– Daniel M. Campbell, CapinCrouse LLP
