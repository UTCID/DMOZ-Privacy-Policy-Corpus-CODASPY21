What Personal Information about visitors does AncientFaces gather?
Information You Give Us:
We collect personal information such as your name, email address,
and other basic information to provide you with an enhanced
experience at AncientFaces. Your information is used to customize
and improve your visits. Registered members enter basic information
about
themselves to gain the ability to create member profiles,
edit email
subscriptions, change any of the material they have
added to
AncientFaces, and communicate with other members. We may
also collect various pieces of visitor information to
track the use of our
web site. This information might include the
visitor's domain name or IP
address, and the visitor's browser and
platform type. All collected
information is kept strictly secure and
private and is never shared.
Use of cookies:
AncientFaces uses cookies for registered member sessions. The
information is erased once you leave the site.
When you sign
in to your profile as a registered member, a cookie is
activated to let our web site know that you are logged in.
This enables your membership functions. Without cookies, we
wouldn't be able to tell if you were signed in or not.
Does AncientFaces Share the Information it receives?
AncientFaces never shares any of our visitors'
personal information.
However, please be aware that
when you post information to AncientFaces certain
information is made available online so that visitors
who are interested in your material can contact you to
discuss your submission.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
AncientFaces is dedicated to protecting your personal
information.
AncientFaces uses Secure-Socket Layer (SSL)
encryption to keep your personal information safe. SSL is an
Internet
Protocol, which allows for the secure transfer of
data. Rather than
transferring data between a number of
carriers, SSL creates a secure
connection between the client
(you) and the host (AncientFaces). To
ensure your personal
information is safe, we employ several other methods of
security.
What Information Can I Access?
AncientFaces gives you access to certain information about you
for
the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases,
updating that
information. You can find this information in
'Your Profile' if you are a member.
Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions.
If

our Terms and Conditions of use,
including limitations on
damages, arbitration of disputes, and
application of the law
of the state of California. If you have any concern about
privacy at AncientFaces, please submit a request at our Contact Us page. Our
business changes constantly and this policy along with the
Terms and Conditions of use will also change.
