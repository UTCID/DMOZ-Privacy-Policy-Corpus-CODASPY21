Privacy Policy
Protecting your personal information
The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) respects your privacy. In an effort to respond to the privacy concerns of Canadians, the federal government enacted the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). Effective January 1, 2004, PIPEDA and applicable provincial legislation have established certain principles for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in Canada. As part of our commitment to you, we want to clarify why we may ask for your personal information and how we will use it.
We collect personal information to maintain a strong relationship with our supporters and to provide them with ongoing service. For example, we collect information that allows us to process your donation, and to confirm your identity and address so we can accurately receipt your donation. We may collect credit card or bank account information if you prefer the convenience of our monthly giving program.
As a result of making a donation to the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC), inquiring about our programs, participating in our surveys or promotions, visiting our website or contacting one of our offices, NCC may have collected some or all of the following personal information from you:
your name
address
telephone number
email address and/or facsimile number
your date of birth
social insurance number
credit card or banking information
Personal information gathered by NCC is kept in confidence. Our personnel are authorized to access personal information based only on their need to deal with the information for the reason(s) for which it was obtained. Safeguards are in place to ensure that the information is not disclosed or shared more widely than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was obtained. We also take measures to ensure the integrity of this information is maintained and to prevent its being lost or destroyed.
NCC keeps its supporters informed of activities and donor opportunities by mailing them occasional updates and appeals for support, including The Ark. From time to time, NCC exchanges mailing lists with other organizations that share similar goals. This is a very cost-effective way for NCC to find new donors. However, if you would prefer not to receive mail from these organizations, please tell us and we will honour your request.
If you do not wish us to use or disclose your information for purposes of providing you with information that may be of interest, please contact us at the address indicated below. Also, please notify us if you wish to update your information so that we maintain accurate records. Once we receive your notification, please allow us 15 business days to update our records. Subject to any legal or statutory requirements, we will abide by your preferences. If you have not notified us previously regarding your preferences and do not do so now, we will consider that you have consented to our continued use, disclosure and retention of your information for these purposes. You may contact us to withdraw or change your consent at any time. We will honour any request you may make to have access to or review your personal information that we have obtained as referred to above.
