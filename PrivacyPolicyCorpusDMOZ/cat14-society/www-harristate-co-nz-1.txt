Terms of Engagement
Our Fees
The fees we will charge you are calculated on the amount of time spent attending to your instructions by our staff and the other factors set out in paragraph 1.3, plus expenses incurred on your behalf in the course of that work.  The rates at which Director and staff time is charged may be altered from time to time, and is available to you on request.
The fees we will charge you will be fair and reasonable for the services provided having regard to your interests and to our interests.
In addition to a charge for the time spent, we are also entitled, in appropriate circumstances to charge additional fees based on a number of factors including:
The skill, specialised knowledge and responsibility required to perform the services properly.
The importance of the matter to you and the results achieved.
The urgency and circumstances in which the matter is undertaken and any time limitations imposed, including those imposed by you.
The degree of risk assumed by us in undertaking the services including the amount or value of the property involved.
The complexity of the matter and the difficulty or novelty of the questions involved.
The experience, reputation and ability of the members of our firm working on your matter.
Any fee arrangement entered into between you and us.
Unless otherwise stated all fees are plus GST.
Expenses such as search and registration fees, administration costs, valuation fees, tolls, faxes and photocopying will be charged in addition to our fee.  Those charges may include a factor to recover the capital cost of some equipment and the cost of administering systems and may be charged as a percentage of fees charged.
We will provide you with a written estimate upon request. If that estimate is likely to be exceeded we shall let you know.
All work done by us is charged on a fees basis apart from commission of 5% of the interest earned on funds which are on deposit with our bank through our bulk deposit scheme.
It is rarely possible to give firm quotes for the cost of legal work. Fee estimates given by us are not firm quotes unless they are in writing and clearly marked as a quote.
We do not undertake work paid for by legal aid. If you are eligible for legal aid then we can assist you to find a lawyer who works on that basis.
Payment of Fees and Expenses
Our fees and expenses are to be paid by the 20th of the month following date of invoice except on conveyancing matters where fees are payable immediately prior to settlement.
Our final account will be sent to you shortly after we have completed your matter.
We will issue interim accounts on a regular basis for ongoing matters where that is appropriate.
You authorise us to deduct our fees and expenses from funds held in our trust account on your behalf upon our issuing an invoice.
We may ask you to pay fees and/or expenses in advance, but in those instances your payment will be held in our trust account and only paid to us by deduction when an invoice is issued.
Interest will accrue on unpaid accounts at the rate of 2.0% per month as from the due date until payment is received in full. Other action to recover unpaid fees may also be taken and all costs, expenses and charges including legal costs (on a solicitor and client basis) incurred by the firm in recovering any money owing to it will be added to the account due by you.
Third Parties: Although you may expect to be reimbursed by a third party for our fees and expenses, and although our invoices may at your request or with your approval be directed to a third party, nevertheless you remain responsible for payment to us if the third party fails to make payment.
We reserve the right to stop work on your retainer if interim accounts or expenses are not paid on time or a request for information or action remains unsatisfied.
Retention of Files and Documents
We will keep a record of all important documents which we receive or create on your behalf on the following basis:
We may keep a record electronically and destroy originals (except where the existence of an original is legally important such as in the case of wills and deeds).
At any time, we may dispose of documents which are duplicates, or which are trivial (such as emails which do not contain substantive information), or documents which belong to us.
We are not obliged to retain documents or copies where you have requested that we provide them to you or to another person and we have done so, although we are entitled to retain copies for our own records if we wish to do so.
We will provide to you on request copies or originals (at our option) of all documents to which you are entitled under the Privacy Act 1993 or any other law.  We may charge you our reasonable costs for doing this.
Where we hold documents that belong to a third party you will need to provide us with that party’s written authority to uplift or obtain a copy of that document.
Unless you instruct us in writing otherwise, you authorise us and consent to us (without further reference to you) to destroy (or delete in the case of electronic records) all files and documents in respect of the services 7 years after our engagement ends (other than any documents we hold in safe custody for you or are otherwise obliged by law to retain for longer).  We may retain documents for longer at our option.  We may charge, in addition to our fee, a file storage fee to cover associated costs with retaining and storing the file and documents.
We may, at our option, return documents (either in hard or electronic form) to you rather than retain them.  If we choose to do this, we will do so at our expense.
We own copyright in all documents or work we create in the course of performing the services but grant you a non-exclusive licence to use and copy the documents as you see fit for your own personal or commercial use.  However, you may not permit any third party to copy, adapt or use the documents without our written permission.
Limitations on extent of our Obligations or Liability
Where we have acted for you in respect of the registration of a security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register (“PPSR”) under the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 and a financing statement is due to expire we will contact you using the contact details on our file, however, (a) if we are unable to contact you as you have not provided us with your current address and contact details; or (b) we no longer act for you, Harris Tate Limited disclaims any liability whatsoever for non-renewal of any such financing statement.
Any other limitations on the extent of our obligations to you or any limitation or exclusion of liability are set out in our Letter of Engagement.
If we have agreed, or are required to by operation of law withhold RLWT on your behalf in respect of a sale and purchase transaction, then we shall be under no liability whatsoever to you for any amount that may have been incorrectly calculated or withheld for RLWT purposes, or for any loss, penalty, or costs that you might incur or suffer as a result of our holding RLWT on your behalf; and
You agree that you will indemnify us against any claims in respect of any loss, penalty or costs that you suffer, or which have been incurred by you in connection with, or as a result of us holding RLWT on your behalf.
To the extent allowed by law, our aggregate liability to you (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) in connection with our services is limited to the amount available to be payable under the Professional Indemnity Insurance held by our firm.
Privacy Act 1993
You authorise us to:
Collect, retain and use any information about you, for the purpose of assessing your creditworthiness or marketing services to you; and
Disclose information about you, whether collected by us from you directly or obtained by us from any other source, to any other credit provider or any credit reporting agency for the purposes of providing or obtaining a credit reference, debt collection or notifying a default by you.
Where you are an individual the authorities above are authorities or consents for the purposes of the Privacy Act 1993.
You shall have the right to request a copy of the information retained by us about you and the right to request us to correct any incorrect information about you held by us.
Complying with laws and regulations
You agree to provide us with information we ask for to help us comply with laws, rules or regulations in New Zealand or overseas. We can use your personal information to help us comply with laws, rules or regulations in New Zealand or overseas, or any New Zealand or overseas legislative or regulatory requests.  For these purposes you agree that we can share your personal information with the police, any governmental body or agency or regulator in New Zealand or overseas (including any tax authorities) as required.
Security
The party signing the attached Letter of Engagement agrees that where the contracting party (the “Contracting Party”) arising from the Letter of Engagement is a company, trust, partnership or other entity (an “Entity”) then in the event that such Entity does not meet payment of the fees arising from our engagement then:
the individual(s) signing the Letter of Engagement for and on behalf of such Entity agrees to meet those fees personally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual payment of those fees and all monies owing by the Contracting Party to Harris Tate Limited (such guarantee enforceable on demand); and
The Contracting Party and each individual signing the Letter of Engagement for and on behalf of any Entity acknowledge and agree that Harris Tate Limited is entitled to take security by way of PPSR registration or, where appropriate, mortgage as security for any outstanding fees and monies and each hereby authorises Harris Tate Limited to attend to and register any such security interest.
Information to Clients
Our Service to You
We will meet our obligations pursuant to the “Rules of Conduct and Client Care for Lawyers” and made in accordance with the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006. Those obligations are to:
Act competently, in a timely way, and in accordance with instructions received and arrangements made.
Protect and promote your interests and act for you free of compromising influences or loyalties.
Discuss with you your objectives and how they should best be achieved.
Provide you with information about the work to be done, who will do it and the way the services will be provided.
Charge you a fee that is fair and reasonable and let you know how and when you will be billed.
Give you clear information and advice.
Protect your privacy and ensure appropriate confidentiality.
Treat you fairly, respectfully and without discrimination.
Keep you informed about the work being done and advise you when it is completed.
Let you know how to make a complaint and deal with any complaint promptly and fairly.

Professional Indemnity Insurance
We hold professional indemnity insurance that meets or exceeds the minimum standards specified by the Law Society.  We will provide you with particulars of the minimum standards upon request.
Lawyers Fidelity Fund
The Law Society maintains the Lawyers Fidelity Fund for the purposes of providing clients of lawyers with protection against pecuniary loss arising from theft by lawyers. The maximum amount payable by the Fidelity Fund by way of compensation to an individual claimant is limited to $100,000.00. Except in certain circumstances specified in the Lawyers & Conveyancers Act 2006 the Fidelity Fund does not cover a client for any loss relating to money that a lawyer is instructed to invest on behalf of the client.
Rights to Terminate your Retainer
You are entitled to terminate your instructions to us upon giving us reasonable notice.  We may terminate your retainer if there is good cause, such as you not providing us with instructions in a sufficiently timely way, your inability or failure to pay our fee or expenses on the agreed basis, your adopting against our advice a course of action which we believe is imprudent, or if we find we are in a position of a conflict of interest, or being asked to act in a manner that may be inconsistent with our fundamental obligations as lawyers.
If we terminate the retainer we will give you reasonable notice so that you can arrange alternative representation and we shall give you reasonable assistance to find another lawyer.
Our fees for services reasonably and properly provided to you prior to the termination of retainer shall be paid by you prior to uplifting your records and we may retain copies of your documents and records.
If you have a Complaint
We maintain a procedure for handling any complaints by clients, designed to ensure that a complaint is dealt with promptly and fairly.
If you have a complaint about our services or charges, you may refer your complaint to the person in our firm who has overall responsibility for your work.
If you do not wish to refer your complaint to that person, or you are not satisfied with that person’s response to your complaint, you may refer your complaint to any Director.
The Director may be contacted as follows:
(a) by letter;    (b)  by email at admin@harristate.co.nz;    (c)  by telephoning (+64) (7) 578 0059
Any complaint or dispute regarding our charges must be brought to the firm’s attention, in writing, as soon as practicable and in any event within 7 days of the date of the invoice.
