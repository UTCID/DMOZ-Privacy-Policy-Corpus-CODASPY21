San Francisco Department of Public Health Policy & Procedures
Library
Welcome to the San Francisco Department of Public Health
(DPH) Policy & Procedures Library.
The Library focuses primarily on policies that apply to staff throughout
DPH.  The Library also includes policies
that are relevant to those working on DPH contracts, our partners in providing
public health and clinical services.  The
Library links to other webpages and websites that maintain policies for major
divisions within DPH, and apply primarily to those divisions (e.g. San
Francisco General Hospital).
The DPH Guidelines on Development and Maintenance of Departmental Polices describes the process for the creation, review, approval, and promulgation of DPH's P&Ps.  This P&P template should be used when writing new policies. Existing policies
may retain their current format with the addition of the Details section (found
at the beginning of the P&P Template document). The Details section
includes crucial information, including, but not limited to, policy title, effective/revision
date(s), policy owner name and contact information, etc.
DPH Guidelines on Development and Maintenance of Departmental Policies
DPH P&P Template: Attachment to DPH Guidelines on Development and Maintenance of Departmental Policies
The finalized DPH policies can be found listed by category or DPH unit.
Each policy in the Library is listed in both sections. Please click on the link(s) to find additional information and the individual policies.
