Here are some places on the internet that we would like to share with you.
Monuments/Markers
Monument Advisors
Alan Lepler, owner of Monument Advisors has more than 30 years of experience in the monument industry. Through his assistance, we are able to provide up-to-date scale drawings for our customers who are looking to purchase monuments to tell their family story at the cemetery. Feel free to visit his website and check out his gallery for ideas, then come and see us in either our Friend or Milford offices.
Social Security
Social Security
The following checklist is designed to help you file for your Social Security benefits correctly so that prompt payments may be made. Eligibility The deceased worker must have credit for work covered by Social Security, ranging from 1 1/2 to 10 years depending on his or her age at death. Who May Receive Monthly Benefits A widow or widower age 60 or older (50 if disabled), or at any age if caring for an entitled child who is under 16 or disabled. A divorced widow or widower age 60 or older (50 if disabled) if the marriage lasted 10 years, or if caring for an entitled child who is under 16 or disabled. Unmarried children up to 18 (19 if they are attending a primary or secondary school full lime). Children who were disabled before reaching 22, as long as they remained disabled. Dependent parent or parents 62 or older. Lump-Sum Death Payment A one time payment of $255 is paid in addition to the monthly cash benefits described above. The lump-sum death payment (LSDP) is paid in the following priority order: A surviving spouse who lived in the same household as the deceased person at the time of death. A surviving spouse eligible for or entitled to benefits for the month of death. A child or children eligible for or entitled to benefits for the month of death. Applying for Benefits You must apply in order to receive benefits. You may apply at any Social Security office or, if you wish, you may apply by telephone. Just dial the toll-free number 1-800-772-1213 and the operator will schedule an appointment for you or arrange for the local Social Security office to take your claim by telephone. Social Security Teleservice - Doing Business by Telephone You may call Social Security toll-free, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. The number to use is 1-800-772-1213. To speak with a representative, call between the hours of 7:00am and 7:00pm on regular business days. At other times and on weekends and holidays, you may leave a message and they will call you back, in most cases, the next business day. You may use the toll-free number to make an appointment either in a Social Security office or telephone to apply for benefits, transact other Social Security business, or just ask questions.
