Covid-19 and How It May Affect Your Tour
Dear CODA TRAVELERS,
Updated June 1, 2020
If you are reading this bulletin, it means you are visiting our site and remain interested in what we are doing at Coda Tours. Thank you. We appreciate the interest, and we hope we will be back traveling with you in the very near future.
Of course, we do not have a clear idea of how travel will be affected in the future as a result of Covid-19, but we do know it will be an uphill climb to assure travelers that we are doing our best to watch out for your health and safety if you choose to travel with us.
We intend to keep our fall & winter 2020 trips (Sep.-Dec.) on schedule for departure. Those are:
The Balkans Discovery – Sep 4-15, 2020
Pakistan – Sep 15-28, 2020
The Sultanate of Oman – Oct 21-30, 2020
Deluxe Egypt & optional Jordan – Nov 8-18, 2020
Fabulous Tunisia – Nov 13-23, 2020
Morocco at the Holidays – Dec 23, 2020-Jan 2, 2021
To reassure you that you can book with Coda Tours and not be concerned about your deposits and payments, we are outlining new, temporary Payment & Cancellation Terms below.
We are actively updating our 2021 Calendar of Tours & Cruises. Please check our website frequently to see the new, exciting trips for next year. We have rescheduled several of the trips that we had to cancel in 2020 when the pandemic started. We hope you, too, will reschedule your trip with us.
We look forward to hearing from all of you. Please remember we are here for all your travel needs. Let us look into domestic trips, future cruises or privately arranged escapes. We are in the office Mon-Fri, 10am-5pm.
Warmest regards,
Jim & Agron
Payment Terms
Effective May 1, 2020, Coda Tours is offering a reduce deposit of $500 to hold any late 2020 or 2021 tour you wish to join. This will remain in effect until further updates.
Rest assured that your payments are never lost. You can book a new 2020 or 2021 scheduled group departure, and if you must cancel prior to 60 days before departure, we will transfer your full deposit to a future Coda tour or hold it on account indefinitely.
Due to the private charter contract for the All-Gay Cruise in Croatia – June 2021, our deposit & cancellation terms remain the same as outlined on the trip webpage https://coda-tours.com/croatia#rates-facts
As of April 15, guests who are already registered for a 2020 scheduled group departure have a delayed final payment due date of 45 days prior to departure.
Cancellations & Transfers
Guests traveling before June 1 who wish to cancel their reservation will receive a travel credit equal toward a future departure. This credit is valid for the future Coda trip of their choice booked. Future credits will not expire. There may be non-recoverable costs associated with your departure that may reduce your future travel credit. Future travel credits greater than $5000 must be split across two or three future trips.
Guests traveling on or after June 1 on a scheduled group departure may transfer to another 2020/2021 trip or departure or receive a travel credit equal to the full monies paid to Coda Tours on the current departure with no fees. However, in certain circumstances there may be non-recoverable costs associated with your departure that may reduce your future travel credit.
For custom departures, guests may transfer their dates later in 2020 or 2021 less non-recoverable costs where applicable.
Departures after July 1 are scheduled to operate unless you have been contacted by Coda Tours with alternative options.
Inquire with Coda Tours for further details on cancellation or transfer policies.
Travel & Travel Protection Questions
If you have purchased travel protection through Travel Guard insurance company, you may be eligible for a credit of your insurance for future use. Please inquire with Coda Tours. Please be patient when calling your travel insurance companies.
Flights
If you have h3 your flight through Coda Tours, we will contact the airline on your behalf. We will advise you if they will refund or offer future credit. If you have booked flights on your own, we recommend contacting your airline as soon as possible. Some carriers have cancelled flights and/or instituted additional restrictions or screening processes about which you should be aware.
