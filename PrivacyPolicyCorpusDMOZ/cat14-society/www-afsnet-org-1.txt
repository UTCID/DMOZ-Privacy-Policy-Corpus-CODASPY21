Privacy Policy
Last updated: 1/23/2019
At the American Folklore Society (AFS), we are committed to protecting your privacy. We aim to collect only the information that is required to provide services to our members or event attendees. If you have any concerns or questions about data privacy, contact us at AmericanFolkoreSociety@gmail.com.
We are committed to on-going efforts to be explicit when we collect data about how it will be used, and to give you an opportunity to give or withhold consent.
AFS operates a website, http://afsnet.org, which is our primary system for: managing all data, including membership and event registration transactions, that are collected online; recording membership, event, store and donation transaction details, including those that are paid by cash or check (transaction details include the date, billing name and mailing address, amount and method of payment, and product details; they do not include credit card, account or routing information); and communicating with members. This website is a service provided by YourMembership; for more information about how YourMembership manages the data collected on our website, see https://unity.yourmembershipinc.com/privacy.aspx.
AFS uses BluePay to process all credit card payments that we receive. AFS can access the billing information, like name and address data, but not the credit card information associated with these transactions. For more information about how BluePay manages data privacy, see https://www.bluepay.com/privacy-policy/.
AFS uses services provided by Zoho to collect and manage annual meeting proposal data. For more information about how Zoho manages data privacy, see https://www.zoho.com/privacy.html.
