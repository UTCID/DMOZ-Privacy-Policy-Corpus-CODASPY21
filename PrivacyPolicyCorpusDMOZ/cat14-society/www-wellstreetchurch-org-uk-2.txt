Safeguarding
Well Street United Church is committed to safeguarding children, young people and vulnerable adults and those who work and volunteer to help with activities associated with the Church. In order to do this the leadership Team of Well Street United Church recognise their collective and individual responsibility to safeguard children, young people and vulnerable adults by:
Having in place a Safeguarding Policy for Children, Young People and Vulnerable Adults which is consistent with legislation and guidance and are reviewed annually;
Ensuring all those involved with Well Street United Church are aware of these policies and their duty to safeguard children, young people and vulnerable adults;
Making available any training and  supervision as required to enable employees and volunteers to be alert to concerns about the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults;
Ensuring those employed and those who volunteer at Well Street United Church are subject to safe recruitment procedures;
Enabling all complaints and concerns to be taken seriously and responded to appropriately.
Any safeguarding concerns in relation to a child or vulnerable adult or any concerns regarding the conduct of a member of staff or volunteer should be brought to the attention of  the Church Safeguarding Officer Sue Ioannou  and by contacting  wellstreetsafeguarding@gmail.com or in her absence the Minister or one of the Elders
