Creating Moments of Fun for Children and Families
Host an Event
Corporations, schools, religious organizations, and other groups are often seeking ways to make an impact beyond financial donations. The Conservative Synagogue of Westport is one recent example. They collaborated with the SportsCenter in Shelton to host an event that gave our children and families a chance to have fun. Make it small, make it big, keep it local-- innovate, create and do something.
The journey through cancer treatment is made up of many moments. We know the journey is hard, but we also know there can be moments of life within that journey.
Talk to us, and together we'll get the ball rolling. For more information please contact us
