CBN Privacy Policy
The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBN) is a Christian ministry dedicated to carrying out the Great Commission and is located and operating in Virginia Beach, Virginia (USA).  CBN is committed to the protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which we collect and use personal information about you as part of our ministry activities.
Who is Responsible for the Personal Information That We Collect?
For the purpose of data protection law, CBN is the data controller in respect of the personal information that we collect and use as part of our ministry activities. CBN does not sell your information to others and will only share your information in the manner and for the reasons set forth below.
What Personal Information Do We Collect?
You provide most such information when you register, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with us. For example, you provide information when you place an order for materials; provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than one account if you have used more than one e-mail address when registering with us); communicate with us by letter, phone or e-mail; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; or otherwise transmit such information to us. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, email address, and phone number; credit card information; the same information may have been supplied for the people to whom items have been shipped, including addresses and phone numbers; e-mail addresses; content of reviews and e-mails to us, and financial information. NOTE: Credit card numbers are used only for donation or payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.
Some information is provided automatically to us.  Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; passwords used for our websites; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
CBN gathers information to more effectively operate its site and to help us personalize and improve your experience while using CBN sites. While some of the information collected is required for membership or necessary to use the services provided by the site, other information is voluntarily given by you as described above.
Sensitive or Special Categories of Information
Some countries consider some personal information particularly sensitive or special. CBN only collects this data when voluntarily given by the individual, such as for processing certain requests (when necessary), and for statistical purposes only.

Who Do We Share Your Personal Information With?
CBN reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party, if CBN has reason to believe that disclosing personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) its rights or property, other website users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Additionally, CBN may disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or when we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, subpoena, warrant or other court order requires it, or authorizes us to do so, or to respond to an emergency situation.
We may share information with other CBN and affiliated entities, such as between the CBN and CBN Europe. See more information with respect to such transfers under the section titled “Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders.”  We may also share your information with others, such as accountants and lawyers, who assist us in carrying out our activities.
CBN may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist CBN in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide such assistance and are legally required to protect personal information disclosed by CBN and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share your information with service providers, contractors and sub-contractors to help us provide the website, products, events and services. We may also use a service provider to process payment information, manage our events, provide analytics or use third party software to manage our customer relationship management system. When we use service providers we provide limited access to your information so that the service provider can perform the tasks on our behalf.  For more information about third party service providers, please see the CBN Third Party Service Provider Information.
In addition to the uses and disclosure of personal information noted above, personal information of CBN members and registrants may be shared with other entities when we have obtained your consent prior to such disclosure. When you have provided consent, we share your limited information, including personal information, as described at the time of consent for the consented purpose.
If you choose not to provide CBN with your personal information, you may still visit most of the CBN website. However, you may be unable to access certain areas, offers and services and you may be unable to take advantage of certain CBN benefits or membership.
Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders
CBN is a Christian organization with a global outreach, headquartered and operating in Virginia Beach, Virginia (USA). We may allow your personal information to be shared with our related entities or third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. This may entail a transfer of your information from a location within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to outside the EEA, or from outside the EEA to a location within the EEA.
When we provide your personal information to a third party service in other global regions, we do so in connection with providing you with member benefits, requested information or services or as required or authorized under law. It is possible the global entities, with which we share your information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information as your country of residence or employment, or may not be subject to any privacy obligations. Global entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as an overseas authority.
CBN works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.
CBN also sends push notifications, the delivery of information from a software application to your mobile device through services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device operating systems. CBN manages access, use and disclosure of your personal data that results from your use of these services.
Your Rights, Including Removing, Correcting or Updating Personal Information
If you wish change your consent about how CBN discloses or uses your information, or wish to access, correct or update personal information (such as your address), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.  Some information can be modified by you directly.  Examples of information you can access easily include recent orders; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, site password); payment settings (including credit card information); e-mail notification settings, including Alerts and newsletters.
THE INFORMATION BELOW APPLIES TO INDIVIDUALS LOCATED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA) ONLY:  You have certain rights with respect to your personal information. These rights may only apply in certain circumstances and are subject to certain exemptions.  NOTE: We may require further information in order to respond to your request (for instance, evidence of your identity and information to enable us to locate your specific personal information).

CBN's website may contain links to third party sites. These sites are not controlled by CBN and CBN is not responsible for any content contained on any such website.
Third-party companies may serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.
CBN does not endorse any product or service of a third-party advertiser, and has no responsibility for the fulfillment of any order placed, the performance of any product or service offered, or the actions or inactions of any such third-party advertiser.
CBN is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites, and the privacy practices employed by such sites may not be the same as CBN’s practices. As with our website, you should become familiar with any external party's privacy policy before visiting and/or providing any personal information through any such site
Cookies
CBN uses cookies to manage our website and email programs. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are used to store information to manage your website experience such as your type of web browser. A cookie can also store preference information to customize your website experience.
Cookies help us understand how users use our websites and emails so we can design better services in the future. Web browsers can be adjusted to disable cookies. However, CBN may not be able to provide you with all the service or functionality you require on the CBN website if you choose to disable cookies.  For more information on cookies, please see the CBN Cookie Policy.
Superbook Privacy Policy
CBN is committed to protecting your privacy and properly handling any personal information we obtain from you. This Kids' Privacy Policy supplements our general Privacy Policy by providing additional privacy measures for children who visit the Superbook Kids website, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). COPPA requires that we inform parents and legal guardians (hereinafter "parents") about how CBN collects, uses and discloses personal information from children under age 13, and that we obtain the consent of parents when we collect personally identifiable information of children under age 13. Our information collection practices are described below. We encourage such "kids" to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we encourage parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.
What Kind of Information Is Collected?
The Superbook Kids website requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. In order for a kid to register on the Superbook Kids website, we collect only the kid's first name, kid's birth date, parent's email address, user name, and password. The birth date is collected in order to validate the age of the guest. All such information is collected so kids can participate in activities, play online games, and have a record of scores, accumulated points, and awards. The parent's email address is collected in order to provide direct notice to the parents of registration by their children under age 13, provide notices from time to time about their use of the website and information on feature updates and changes, conduct online contests or sweepstakes, or offer other online activities. We may not condition the participation by a kid in any of our online activities on the kid's providing more information than is reasonably necessary. The kids also are able to email or call us and interact with one of our trained prayer counselors, which would include the collection of the email address or telephone number that he or she uses.
Parental Consent
When kids request a Superbook Kids website account, we send to the parents an email with a link that can be used to create a kid’s account by specifying the username and password for the kid’s account. If the parent creates a kid account, the parent is consenting and agreeing that it is acceptable for the kid to be registered, enter Superbook contests or sweepstakes, create a publicly viewable cartoon character avatar and username that is displayed in locations such as the account profile pages and game leaderboards, and to contact the Superbook team for prayer or technical support. If a parent creates or permits the registration or entry, the kid will be able to proceed with all such activities described in this policy without further parental notification or consent. Parents will be notified using the parent email address provided at registration if their child wins a contest or sweepstakes. If the parent would like to receive the prize, the parent will need to provide their address for delivery of the prize.
How Information May Be Disclosed
CBN generally does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that children under age 13 provide, except occasionally we may share such information with third parties who may be engaged by CBN specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g., conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their services, but may not use it for other purposes. We may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law, judicial process, or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our Terms of Use, to protect the property or security of our website, or to take reasonable measures to protect the rights, property or safety of CBN and others.
Push Notifications
We send push notifications, the delivery of information from a software application to your mobile device through services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device operating systems. CBN manages access, use and disclosure of your personal data that results from your use of these services.
Parental Access
CBN wants to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. Parents can contact us if they are interested in reviewing any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or require that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. CBN endeavors to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child, to be reasonably certain that the person is in fact the child's parent.
Changes to Superbook Privacy Policy
CBN may amend this policy at any time. Parents of registered kids will be notified of any material changes that pertain to the collection, use or disclosure of kids' personal information. We encourage parents to advise us of any changes to their email addresses.
