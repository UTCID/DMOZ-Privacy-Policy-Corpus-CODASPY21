Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Westminister Rockford collects non-personally-identifying information of the

how Westminister Rockford's visitors use its website. From time to
time, Westminister Rockford may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by

Westminister Rockford also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on westminsterrockford.org

commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
