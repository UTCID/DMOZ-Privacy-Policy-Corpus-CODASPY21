SOLD OUT! A heart felt THANK YOU to all of our supporters!
When is lunch worth $100?
When it supports the CASA Children's Fund!
Join us February 19, 2020!
The CASA Children's Fund was created to enable CASA Advocates to purchase special items to enrich or just add normalcy to a CASA child's life. The Children's Fund provides soccer and YMCA camps, class yearbooks, tutoring, art and school supplies, and many other things children in foster care might otherwise go without.
The stories from CASA youth and their Advocates will inspire you. Guests will also hear Juvenile Court Judge Denine Guy give an update on the Court as well as introduce the new Dependency Court Judge, the Honorable Timothy Schmal.
You can preorder delicious cookies from Pacific Cookie Company and beautiful succulent plants for your home or office and we will have them waiting for you at the Luncheon.
All proceeds from the Luncheon go to the CASA Children's Fund.
Luncheon Date and Location:
February 19, 2020
11:15am-1:30pm
Severino's Grill
7500 Old Dominion Court
Aptos
Thank you to our amazing event sponsors!
