In no event shall either party be liable to the other for any special, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages arising out of this agreement or the use of the donated goods.
In order to receive any goods from WIN’s inventory, an organization must be a non-profit organization, or public government agency, as recognized by the IRS.
Individuals requesting distributions of donated materials through WIN must be authorized to receive donated materials on behalf of their organization or agency.
By registering for a membership with WIN, users acknowledge to receive goods only to benefit the non-profit organization or government agency they represent.

Items received from WIN must be used solely for the care of the ill, needy, or minors, or for the public benefit, pursuant to the organization or agency’s purpose.
Members agree to keep receipts for all transactions with WIN for a period of 2 years in the event the IRS wishes to verify these transactions.
All product WIN distributes has been donated and all donated merchandise is distributed ‘As Is’. Warranties are not valid on any donated item.
NEITHER WIN NOR ANY PERSON ON WIN’S BEHALF HAS MADE OR MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EITHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OR PERFORMANCE OF GOODS, WHETHER ARISING BY LAW, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE OR OTHERWISE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED, AND (B) WINWAREHOUSE ACCOUNT HOLDER (INCLUDING ANY USERS) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANYONE RECEIVING GOODS FROM WIN ON BEHALF OF WINWAREHOUSE ACCOUNT HOLDER HAS RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE BY WIN, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ON WIN’S BEHALF.

Website Terms & Conditions
Agreement between user and winwarehouse.org
Welcome to winwarehouse.org. The winwarehouse.org website (the “Site”) is comprised of various web pages operated by Worldwide Inventory Network, Inc. (“WIN”). Winwarehouse.org is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the “Terms”). Your use of winwarehouse.org constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these terms carefully and keep a copy of them for your reference.
Winwarehouse.org is a Non-profit Site
The purpose of this website is to provide a resource to connect non-profit organizations with donated corporate excess inventory. Approved non-profit organizations may receive distributions of donated goods by selecting items through our on-line inventory catalog. This website is also a resource for our donors as well as the non-profit community we serve.
Shipping & Freight
Winwarehouse.org may provide shipping services for certain items ordered on the Site through third parties such as UPS or the USPS. The cost of items shipped or delivered using a third party is not covered under the stated Handling Fee and will be calculated separately for each order. Shipping costs are non-refundable.
WIN is not responsible for items damaged in transit.
WIN does not provide or coordinate freight shipping or shipping for any item in excess of 150lbs. When ordering bulk items members are encouraged to use their own third party shipping solutions. WIN requires a minimum advanced notice of 1 business day to coordinate pickup or delivery of any order.
Most distributions ship from our warehouse within 1 business day of placing your order. Larger distributions may take a little longer. If you have any questions regarding a specific product or order, feel free to call us, emails us, or fill out our contact form.
Cancellation/Return Policy
All transactions are final. Worldwide Inventory Network does not allow any returns on items delivered as described.
Shipping fees and/or Return shipping costs are not refundable and are the sole responsibility of the member.
Items marked “hold for local pickup” will be stored free of charge for up to seven days. Items not picked up after seven days will be considered abandoned and will be returned to inventory and made available to other members. WIN will not refund Handling Fees for abandoned merchandise.
Due to the dynamic nature of the Internet, Handling Fees may change at any time without notice. WINwarehouse.org does not offer price protection.
Due to licensing and copyright laws, we do not accept returns on software once a package has been opened. Defective software will be exchanged for the same title only, and only if available.
Damaged or defective products not as described must be reported within 7 business days of receipt of product.
To return a product you must obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. WIN Warehouse will not accept returns without prior authorization.
RMA numbers are valid for 30 days. RMA numbers will not be extended and will be closed upon expiration. Once the RMA has been issued you will receive an email explaining what to expect during the return process.
If the return is a multiple box shipment the RMA number must be marked on all packages returned. All packages returned must have the RMA number displayed in large bold letters on the outside of the box. Unauthorized or Unmarked returns will not be honored and may be refused upon receipt and/or shipped back at the customer’s expense.
Shipments that are refused without authorization, or that are returned due to an invalid address, are subject to a 15% Return Fee plus applicable handling fees.
All product(s) must be returned as originally received to include original packaging, manuals, documentation, and all bundled accessories. Returns must be packaged appropriately as to minimize any unnecessary damage during transit. Product(s) damaged during shipment will invalidate the RMA and will be returned to the customer at the customer’s expense.
All replacements are subject to product availability. If an exact replacement is not available upon testing, Worldwide Inventory Network may substitute the product(s) with a similar, suitable, or upgraded product(s) of equal or greater value within 7 to 10 business days. If none of these options are available, Worldwide Inventory Network will credit the customer’s account for the Handling Fee paid upon checkout.
