Meghan asked for gift cards to be donated to Circle of Care instead of gifts for her 11th birthday this year!
Circle of Care is proud to have the support of so many local families and community organizations. Schools, Scouts, and churches; civic, social and charitable organizations all donate their time, talents and resources to help families with cancer. Birthday parties, and bake sales raise funds and awareness, and toy and book drives help fill our Bags of Love. Some commonly held Community & Corporate Events include tennis tournaments; school or office dress-down days, comedy nights, dinner dances, fashion shows, musical performances/concerts, 5K's, and so much more.
