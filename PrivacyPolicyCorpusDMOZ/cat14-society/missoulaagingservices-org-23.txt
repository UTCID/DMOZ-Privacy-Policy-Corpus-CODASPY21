Elder Justice Program
Elder Justice ProgramMissoula Aging Services (MAS) offers no cost help navigating the legal system for older adults, and those who care for them, through the Elder Justice Program.
In cases where guidance on legal issues is needed, the MAS Resource Center can connect you with recommended community resources.
Resource Center staff will meet with you to understand the details of your situation and offer assistance on how to proceed. If your issue requires the services of an attorney, we can recommend lawyers that may be available to help. There are no charges for this work - however, if a private attorney is needed those charges will be between you and that attorney.
