From January-February, 2004: Please visit this page for more information. Our experience has ended - see below for helpful information. The MyParenTime.com domain name is being used without permission to send unsolicited bulk emails containing non-family-friendly information and a non-family-friendly website link. Please know that we do not condone this, and are doing everything possible to end this situation. Please do not email us asking us to remove your email address. Since no one at myparentime.com is sending any emails, we cannot help you. Unfortunately, the work is being done by spammers who are misusing the myparentime.com domain name. I am aware of the spammers and the emails they are sending. I have tried contacting their ISPs, and will continue to do so each time I discover a new IP. I have been forwarding as many spam emails as I possibly can, but I simply do not have the time to send them all. I would appreciate it if you could please locate the IP # in the full header of the email, then visit this website to discover the ISP that the spammer is using. After you discover the ISP, forward the spam email (including full headers) to their abuse department. This will help all of us caught in the loop.
2005 Update: We are finally recovering from this issue. Thanks to everyone for your support and patience during this experience.
Below you will find a few tips on responding to spam emails, which are included in the autoresponder we send when someone sends an email to a non-existing email address at myparentime.com:
Please do not reply to this message -- no one will receive it.
Due to an overwhelming amount of spam, this email address was created as a "catch-all" for all email sent to the following website contacts:
MyParenTime.com, PrintableChecklists.com, StopSexOffenders.com, and JupiterParents.com
MyParenTime.com does NOT send unsolicited emails -- we have a strict opt-in mailing list only, that sends email to our members once per month. We especially do not send anything NON-Family-Friendly.
If you are receiving spam, we offer the following tips to keep in mind:
NEVER REPLY TO SPAM EMAILS!
1. You don't want these people to know you have an active email address,
2. You may be replying to an innocent party, in which case that innocent party may receive 1000 times more emails due to the original spam emails sent (this is what was happening in my case),
3.Check the original email headers for IP address, to discover the true identity of the person sending spam. It is very easy to create a reply-to address in an email, which spammers often do.
If you are truly trying to reach someone at MyParenTime.com, PrintableChecklists.com, StopSexOffenders.com or JupiterParents.com, please visit the appropriate website for contact information.  Do not hit "reply" - no one will receive your message.
Thank you, and we apologize for the inconvenience.
