Homelessness support services
The Salvation Army is committed to keeping our homelessness services accessible while addressing the COVID-19 restrictions. This includes ensuring the safety and well-being of our clients and staff throughout this time, particularly as we enter the post lockdown stages of COVID-19.
For the current state-based, or service-specific information, please contact individual services by looking for contact information in the 'Find a homelessness service near you' form below.
The Salvation Army is the largest provider of homelessness services in Australia.
Services are free, voluntary, accredited and delivered by professional and committed staff. Our philosophy is that every person deserves dignity, respect and quality of service and that no one should be without a safe, affordable and secure home.
At The Salvation Army we are proud to provide a range of homelessness services specific to adults and families, including accompanying children. This includes accommodation, case management services, advocacy, limited financial assistance, counselling and meals, as well as connection and referral to other specialist services.
