PLYMOUTH — The state's office of labor and workforce development will receive more than $500,000 from the federal government to help find jobs for those laid off when the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station closed this May.The U.S. Department of Labor will provide a $503,079 National Dislocated Worker Grant to the state. The money will help provide services like career planning, resume writing and job placement to the laid-off workers, the department said in a statement. All the dislocated workers have also been certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, which allows them to seek training and support services in preparation for reemployment.The Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station shut down its reactor for the last time on Friday, May 31. The station employed about 600 nuclear professionals, according to Entergy, the plant's parent company. Of those employees, about 50 accepted offers to continue with the company in other locations.Supported by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, Dislocated Worker Grants temporarily expand the service capacity of dislocated worker programs at state and local levels by providing funding assistance in response to large, unexpected economic events that cause significant job losses.
