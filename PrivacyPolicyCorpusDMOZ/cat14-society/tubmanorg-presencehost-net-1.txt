Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect the health and wellness of our clients and staff, some of Tubman's services are being temporarily suspended or shifting to being done remotely. Our 24-hour-line and family violence shelter remain open at this time.
Updates on specific Tubman services can be found here.
Additionally, community resources that may be helpful include:
Health and Wellness Resources
Community Chemical Health Resources
Children and Family Activities
If you have questions, please call our 24-hour line at 612.825.0000.
Tubman provides comprehensive services to serve families and individuals across the Twin Cities. We can help with crisis situations through our 24-hour resource line (612.825.0000) and shelter services. We will also support clients through their long-term healing processes and help them overcome barriers through our core service areas: shelter and housing, mental and chemical health, legal services, youth programs, and workshops and support groups.
Our current Program Guide is available here.
