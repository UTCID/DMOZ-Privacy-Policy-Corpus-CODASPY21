FAQs
Dear readers,
We are experiencing technical problems with our app. The update is underway but is delayed due to a disrupted development schedule because of the coronavirus. In the meantime, we disabled the paywall for app users.
In addition, we encourage you to read the Nation on the website download our issues PDFs and keep in touch via newsletters curated by our editors. We will send you an update once the app is fixed so make sure you are subscribed to receive emails from The Nation. Thank you for your continued support.

How many articles at TheNation.com can I read for free?
We believe that good journalism is worth paying for. It’s true for the content that we pay to read, and it’s true for the content that we produce. In general, we offer three (3) free articles a month. This means that on the TheNation.com, you can read three free articles within a 30-day period. After the first article, you’ll be asked for your e-mail address so we can be in touch. However, we’re always testing the best ways to offer readers our journalism, whether it’s a digital day pass or other types of access. This data allows us to adopt a strategy that supports the financial well-being of The Nation, in turn allowing us to produce even more of the award-winning journalism that our readers have come to expect. As always, thank you for your support!
