Cookie Policy
Cookies
A “Cookie” is a data file that is created and stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit our Services, and it allows our Services to identify your web browser, for example.  Cookies facilitate user preferences, allowing a website to remember the user.  Cookies can also be used in order to allow for our Site to function properly
How We Use Cookies
We use Cookies to track how our users access and use the services offered on our website, to learn when and how users visit the website, to learn which search terms are used, and to learn which websites direct you to the Services. We also use cookies to help display certain information about FrontStream services and to improve your enjoyment and convenience when using or visiting the website; for example, by remembering your contact and other information when you access or use the Services.  We also use Cookies to facilitate login and access actions to enter a user account.
Specifically, we use strictly necessary cookies, which allow you to access and use our Services, and which allow us to deliver those Services to you. For example, when you visit our website and login to your user account, we use Session Id cookies and Javascript check cookies.
We use performance cookies that allow us to track site usage. This allows us to learn more about how users use the Services so that we make changes and improvements, as necessary.
We use targeting cookies that measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and to track sites you’ve visited so that we can measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
We also allow third parties to place their cookies within our Services. For example, some of the companies that use our Services add custom code that allows them to add performance and targeting cookies to the pages they offer to their users.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.  You can decide if and how your web browser will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser.  You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your web browser. If you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Site.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse Cookies, we will issue Cookies when you direct your browser to our Site.
Change settings from within your browser
Our cookie acceptance notification makes it easy for you to enable and disable all non-essential FrontStream Cookies but will not stop all Cookies from other websites being set. To do this you may change your settings from within your browser by going to the “help” function on most browsers. If you choose to have your browser refuse Cookies, then it is likely that some areas of the website will not function properly when you use or visit them.
The instructions for these vary from browser to browser and they may change from time to time as new versions are released. Here are some links to instructions for the most common browsers:
