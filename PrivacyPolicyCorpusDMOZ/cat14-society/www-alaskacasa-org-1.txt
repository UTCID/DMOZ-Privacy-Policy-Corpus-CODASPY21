Become a CASA AdvocateThere are a number of ways to become involved in our organization. A CASA volunteer is a trained community volunteer who is appointed by a juvenile court judge to speak for an abused or neglected child’s best interests. Volunteers are required to complete 30 hours of pre-service training, submit to screening and background checks and they must be 21 years of age or older.
