Practical Help for Pastors' WivesMemorizing ScriptureYour Word have I hid in
my heart that I might not sin against You. Psalm 119:11
Excerpted from
Billy Graham' site:
Living in Christ: How to Memorize Scripture:
How to Memorize Scripture
Do you doubt your ability to memorize these Bible verses? Maybe
these tips will help:
Say it aloud
Say the verse aloud so that you can hear it as well as see it
and think it. Do you ever find yourself thinking about a song
you have recently heard? Or about something someone has said to
you? The ear remembers! Use this built-in "memory chip" to help
you memorize Scripture.
Say it the same way each time
Write the verse on a card and include a topic name, such as
"Applying God's Word," along with the verse and the reference.
Each time you say the verse, do so in this order:
1.
The Topic
2.
The Reference
3.
The Verse
4.
Repeat the Reference
Reciting these four elements the same way each time will help
you to firmly fix the passage in your mind.
Say it one phrase at a time
If you find the verse "too big for one bite," memorize it a
phrase at a time, adding each phrase in order till you have the
whole verse. Even if you start with just three or four words,
say the reference before and after the phrase.
Say it again and again
The real secret of Scripture memorization is review, review,
review. Quote the verses often, asking God for deep
understanding and seeking to apply each verse to your life. ©Billy Graham Ministries

How Does The Message Board Work?
Our Message Board is open to any pastor's wife who has registered. This makes for a safe place to "be ourselves" without judgment. An online message board works like this: One person types a question, situation, or statement. Other members of the Board can read it and reply under what the previous person has written. Most posts receive numerous replies; some long some short.
