Make A DonationAdvocacy from a Distance:
In the midst of this unprecedented pandemic, children and families are struggling to make it through each day, one day at a time. Many of our families, already engaged with the child welfare system prior to COVID-19, will have an even more difficult time than the average family. Fortunately, CASA volunteers can still be strong supporters and advocates for the children they are appointed to and their families, while still observing social distancing and self-quarantining protocols.
The Illinois CASA network of 31 Local Programs are stepping up their contacts with children in new and creative ways with a shared mission to make weekly contact with families and children. We are also reaching out to former youth in care to let them know know they have  a caring adult connection.
Please support youth in care, Illinois’ most vulnerable children.  All donations will go directly to benefit our children.  If you want your donation to go to a specific county or local program email james@illinoiscasa.org with donation information.
