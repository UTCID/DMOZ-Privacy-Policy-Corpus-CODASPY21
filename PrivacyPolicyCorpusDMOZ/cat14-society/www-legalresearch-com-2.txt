Our Customers Say It Best
We just heard the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court! In other words....WE WON! Just wanted to say thank you for all that you have done for us! You have no idea how this little boy's life will be greatly impacted as a result! We needed to win this for TK and could not have done it without you!Experienced LitigatorShreveport, LA“I think LRC fills a very valuable role. There is no way that my firm, or most firms, could produce these projects for the same cost. I know that you thought that I was unusual in directing a client to LRC rather than capturing the work for my firm, but I believe that my professional responsibility is to obtain the best overall result for my client.”Dennis BlackGoldberg Kohn’s Corporate Securities & Tax Group, Chicago, ND“I’ve used LRC’s whole gamut of services—research, memo writing, brief drafting, etc. I’ve also used LRC on a number of appeals. Every time I’ve used LRC I’ve won the case.”Mary MaringFargo, ND“Great #$&*@! brief!”John GehlhausenLamar, CO“I just wanted to express my appreciation and to compliment your staff for the outstanding assistance you provided me. The trial brief and post-trial brief were an invaluable contribution to the over-all effort that achieved the largest verdict in Wisconsin history. I would not hesitate to call upon your services again in the future and I would enthusiastically recommend your services to other attorneys.”Donald A. ShapiroChicago, Illinois
