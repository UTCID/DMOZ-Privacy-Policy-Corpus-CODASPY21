Comment Policy
Comments Submitted Through Social Media Are Not Official Public Comments.
Comments submitted to the Commission through social media platforms, such as Twitter, are not official for purposes of the Commission’s formal rulemaking process. Official public comments must be submitted directly to the Commission by electronic mail or regular mail during a formal comment period. The email address for public comment is Public_Comment@ussc.gov. The Commission may follow, respond directly to users or repost content. "Follows", "mentions" or "retweets" do not imply bias or endorsement.
Comments Will Be Monitored.
The Commission acknowledges that social media tools are intended to foster a healthy dialogue among users, and it encourages the use of social media for that purpose. The Commission also recognizes that social media users may present various, sometimes divergent, views on issues that impact federal sentencing. Commission staff will monitor all comments posted to Commission accounts through social media outlets. The Commission reserves the right to delete comments. Among the types of comments that will be deleted are comments that:
are overtly political, partisan, or made in support of a political party or a candidate in a political campaign;
contain requests to contact any federal, state, or local government official, including a member of Congress;
include advertisements, endorsements, or promotions of specific commercial services or products;
contain language that is vulgar, abusive, or offensive;
include sensitive or personally identifiable information;
contain threats or defamatory statements; or
