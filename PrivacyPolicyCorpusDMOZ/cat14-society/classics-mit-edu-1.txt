Information and Privacy
Policy
The Internet Classics Archive is committed to
preserving the privacy and security of its visitors. Information about
visitors will not be sold or provided to any third party. Visitor
information is collected only to enhance the experience of the visitor
and subsequent visitors. To that end, the following information is
collected by the Internet Classics Archive:
server access log
For every page, script, and image access, an entry is recorded
in the server access log file. The access log is used only for internal
purposes, such as identifying malfunctioning parts of the site,
streamlining the site to better react to visitor behavior, and
determining the frequency of use of various parts of the
site. Occasionally, the access log records may be used to identify
visitors who abuse the site (especially the commentary area);
specifically, the information is used to identify the visitor's host
and Internet service provider in order to send a complaint. Each
access log entry includes time and date information, the requested and
referring URL, the visitor's browser (name, version, and platform),
and the visitor's host IP address. For example (the IP address has
been x'ed out):
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [03/Jun/1998:02:44:53 -0400] "GET /Xenophon/xen.anab.html HTTP/1.0" 200 6993 "http://classics.mit.edu/Browse/browse-Xenophon.html" "Mozilla/4.04 (Macintosh; I; PPC)"
server error log
Every time a visitor encounters an error on the site, an
entry is recorded in an error log much like the server access log. The
error log is carefully scrutinized to determine any mistakes in the
archive. Occasionally, log entries may be correlated with errors
reported over e-mail to more fully determine the cause of an
error. The error log entry includes time and date information and data
about the error, which could include a requested URL and/or the
visitor's IP address. For example (the IP address has been x'ed out):
[Wed Jun
3 18:23:16 1998] [error] Directory index forbidden by rule: /var/classics.mit.edu/htdocs/Hesiod/
and
[Wed Jun
