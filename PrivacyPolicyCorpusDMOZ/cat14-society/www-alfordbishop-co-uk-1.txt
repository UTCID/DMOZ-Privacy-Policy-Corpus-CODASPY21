Alford & Bishop Privacy Policy
Alford & Bishop Legal Recruitment is specialist legal recruitment company who are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
About this Policy
This policy sets out the basis on which any personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be treated. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a new regulation which replaces the Data Protection Regulation (Directive 95/46/EC). The Regulation aims to work as one with data protection legislation across EU member states, enhancing privacy rights for individuals and providing a strict framework within which commercial organisations can legally operate.
Even though the UK has bought to light its intention to leave the EU in 2019, the GDPR will be applicable in the UK from 25th May 2018. The Government intends for the GDPR to continue in UK law post Brexit and has also introduced a Data Protection Bill to replace the current Data Protection Act. Your new rights under the GDPR are set out in this policy but will only apply once the GDPR becomes law on 25th May 2018. Where you provide us with your personal information in person, by email, through our websites, job boards, social media or via any other method you consent to the collection and use of this information by Alford & Bishop in accordance with this privacy policy.
