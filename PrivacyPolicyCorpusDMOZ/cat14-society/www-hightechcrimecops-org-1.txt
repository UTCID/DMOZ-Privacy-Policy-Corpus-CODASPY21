Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us and we take our obligations seriously. To this end, we are required by European law to advise you that this website makes use of cookies and that we may also collect other information about your visit.
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site
If you do not want to receive cookies the simplest ways to avoid them are;
Do not use the internet.
Remove any cookies after your visit
Visit the site using your browser in 'private' mode, also known as incognito mode.
When someone visits this website we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. We collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to find out the identities of casual visitors to our website, however our records may tell us more about you if you have registered for an account.
In the event that you do wish to register for an account, at minimum you may need to provide a user name, email address and a password. Passwords are automatically encrypted in our systems and our staff have no way of knowing what they are, even our system administrators can not see your password in a human readable form. Should you forget your password, please not ask us for it as we do not know what it is. Our 'login' form allows you to reset your password, providing that you have access to your email address.
As part of the service that this website provides, we may from time to time, ask additional information about yourself, your friends or your family. When so, we undertake not to share this information with any third party and we will be upfront about why we are asking this of you.
More About Cookies
We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no options disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use. For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies.
Disabling Cookies
You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
The Cookies We Set
If you create an account on the site then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out, however in some cases they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when logged out.
We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.
This site may offer newsletter or email subscription services and cookies may be used to remember if you are already registered and whether to show certain notifications which might only be valid to subscribed/unsubscribed users.
This site may provide e-commerce or payment facilities and some cookies are essential to ensure that your order is remembered between pages so that we can process it properly.
From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights, helpful tools, or to understand our user base more accurately. These surveys may use cookies to remember who has already taken part in a survey or to provide you with accurate results after you change pages.
When you submit data to through a form such as those found on contact pages or comment forms cookies may be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.
In order to provide you with a great experience on this site we provide the functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you use it. In order to remember your preferences we need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page is affected by your preferences.
Perhaps most surprisingly, if you wanted this site to remember that you would prefer not to receive cookies, you would probably need to receive a cookie to record this preference. For this reason we do not provide this facility and we need to remind you that how you deal with cookies is an entirely personal matter and not something that we are able to help you with.
Third Party Cookies
In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.
This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.
The configuration which we use, allows you to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking providing that you have the relevant browser extensions installed. Search for 'Google analytics opt out' to find out more. For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official Google Analytics page.
Whilst Google Analytics can be described as a third party, at the time of writing it does not usually set third party cookies unless the host site also carries Google advertising.  Whilst this site does not routinely carry advertising, if it were to do so at any time now or in the future it would probably be necessary to issue third party cookies via a third party.
Lastly, we also may use social media buttons and/or plugins, including 'single sign-on' technology that allow you to connect with your social network in various ways. For these to work social media sites such as; Facebook, Twitter and others will set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute to the data they hold for various purposes outlined in their respective privacy policies.
More Information
Hopefully this has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.
That's most of the red tape and legal stuff to do with privacy. Phew!
