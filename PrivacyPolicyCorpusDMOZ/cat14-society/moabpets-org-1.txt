Help us to help those who have no other voice. HSMV is funded solely by donations and grants. We are not affiliated with other state or federal humane societies, hence, we are responsible for funding our own budget.
We are able to accomplish our mission because of your generosity. On behalf of the animals we care for, THANK YOU for your generous support.

DONATE TO THE SUNNY MEDICAL FUND
The Humane Society of Moab Valley sometimes rescues an animal that needs immediate live-saving medical attention.  The Sunny Medical Fund is set up for that purpose. It is named for Sunny, the happiest dog ever, who was found on the street suffering from advanced heart and liver disease.  The Moab community generously donated to save Sunny in March and April 2016 and even though she had to make weekly visits to the vet for treatment, she still was smiling and spreading sunshine and joy wherever she went and to whomever she met.  Please donate now so that we have funds to help the next homeless pet in need of lifesaving medical treatment. Donate to the Sunny Medical Fund.
GIFTS IN KIND
Donate dog and cat food and treats, beds, toys, collars, leashes, crates and kennels or kitty litter.
