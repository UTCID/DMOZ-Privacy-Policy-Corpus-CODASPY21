Our
Privacy Protection Promise to You
1. For the past 40 years we were the first
and continue to be the leader in
protecting privacy for brides-to-be who
have entrusted us with their personal
information. We consider our relationship
with you to be strictly confidential. We
will not sell information about you, your
fiance, your wedding, etc. Only those who
work for us that are directly responsible
for sending emails, your magazine issues
or special mailings through our bonded
mailing house will see your information
unless you personally authorize us to send
information to a wedding professional for
you.
2. Be very skeptical about anyone who
claims that we released any information
about your wedding without your
permission. There are many websites,
clipping services and others who collect
bride-to-be names from other web site
logins, newspaper announcements, other's
bridal show attendance lists & bridal show
vendor prize drawing lists, gift registry
services and even from retail store
customer lists. A large, profitable
business exists to sell or trade your
name, address, and wedding information --
none of which receive any information from
us nor are supported or approved by New
England Bride.
3. In addition to monthly magazines sent
to qualified brides-to-be, we may send you
promotional mailings and/or emails from
us, such as bridal show announcements and
special offers from our advertisers. In
each instance, you can rest assured that
we either send the materials from our
offices directly to you, or we hire bonded
professional mailing/emailing companies
that operate under strictly enforced
confidentiality rules. In fact, we seed
our list with test names to be sure no one
is illegally using our members'
information.
4. We also produce bridal shows. If you
choose to reserve free tickets vendors at
the show will receive your name, address,
wedding date and email address.
5. Periodically our staff will contact
members asking for suggestions and
research information to improve our web
site and our magazine. Again, rest assured
that this information is for our internal
use only and will be held in the strictest
confidence.
6. If you suspect that your personal
information is being circulated or used
illegally, contact or membership
department immediately and report this to
us for investigation at 1-800-241-5458.
