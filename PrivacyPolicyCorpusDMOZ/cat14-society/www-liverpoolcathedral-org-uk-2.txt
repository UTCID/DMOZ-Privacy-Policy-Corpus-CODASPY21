These terms and conditions of sale ("Conditions of Sale") (together with the documents referred and linked to in them) tell you ("you", "You" or "Your" being the purchaser of Bricks) the terms and conditions on which we supply any of the bricks for placement in the People’s Path to you.

Your Status
By placing an order, you promise that: (a) you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts;and (b) you are at least 18 years old.
How the contract is formed between you and us
Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Brick. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm your order by sending you an e-mail that confirms your order ("Order Confirmation"). The contract between us will only be formed when we send you the Order Confirmation. The contract will relate only to those Bricks we have confirmed in the Order Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Bricks which may have been part of your order unless and until such Bricks have been confirmed in a separate Order Confirmation. Any Order Confirmation given is still subject to these Conditions of Sale. All contracts between us and you are subject to the paragraph below entitled “Cancellation of Scheme and Withdrawal of Bricks”.
Statutory Rights of Cancellation
Please note that because the Bricks are bespoke you will not have a statutory right of cancellation under The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.
Cancellation of People’s Path Scheme and Withdrawal of Bricks
We reserve the right to cancel the People’s Path scheme for any reason including, without limitation, because we are not granted appropriate planning permission to complete or continue with the People’s Path scheme.
We guarantee that Bricks will stay in location till 2029. If the People’s Path scheme is cancelled before the end of your Brick’s minimum installation, we will refund you the price you paid for your Brick. Without prejudice to your statutory rights as a consumer, we will not be liable to you or a third party by reason of us cancelling the People’s Path scheme, withdrawing any Bricks or refusing to process any order.
Availability
In rare instances, we may not be able to site your Bricks in a suitable location, even though we have indicated there is availability. Where this is the case, we will inform you of this by email and will give you the option of selecting another Brick or cancelling your order.
Price and Payment
All prices are quoted in £ sterling and include VAT. The Cathedral VAT number is GB548487201. Except in the case of manifest error, the prices payable for the Bricks that you order are as set out on the site at the time at which you place your order.

We reserve the right to refuse credit card payments in our reasonable discretion. We may charge your credit or debit card at any time following submission of your order.
Description of Bricks
The Bricks depicted on our site and in literature are representations of the brick and the actual bricks may differ. The reproduction of colours and styles are as accurate as photographic and image processing will allow but the actual bricks may differ. We do not accept responsibility for slight variances in colour and style.
