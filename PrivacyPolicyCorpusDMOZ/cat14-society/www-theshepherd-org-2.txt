ARBITRATION.
You agree that any dispute between you and us relating in any way to the Services, our
advertising or marketing practices, any Products sold or distributed through the
Services, or this Agreement, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in
court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an
individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or we may seek equitable
relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such
as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose
or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of
this Agreement.
IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH US, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT
PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST
US ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF. INSTEAD, BY
AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING COVERED CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL
ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR
OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY
CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must
send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Administration c/o
Shepherd Church, 19700 Rinaldi Street, Porter Ranch CA 91326. The arbitration will
be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not
inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS' most current
version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject
to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,
available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS's rules are
also available at www.jamsadr.comor by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not
available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the
arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing
and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, we will pay them for you.
In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS' filing, administrative, hearing and/or
other fees for claims with an amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000 unless
the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed
location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court
or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the
interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration
Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this
Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and
liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be
consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part
of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary
damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Agreement (including the
Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or
decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages
awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same
authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND CHURCH HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY
RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PERMITTED HEREIN) AND HAVE
A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Church are instead electing that all
covered claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
Agreement, except as specified herein. An arbitrator can award on an individual
basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a
court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of
an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A
CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE FOR
CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER
OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
USER. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this
section is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or
dispute, neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration of such claim or
dispute and instead the applicable claim or dispute shall be resolved in a court
as set forth below.
EXCLUSIVE VENUE.
To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation
in a court, both you and Meredith agree that all claims and disputes arising out of
or relating to this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state courts in
Los Angeles County, California or federal courts located in the Central District of
California.
GENERAL.
Severability. Subject to "Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions," above, if
any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and
shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect.
Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or
expiration of the Agreement or your relationship with us.
Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree
that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not
apply to any individual claim(s) of which you had already provided notice to us.
Assignment. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be
assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without our prior
written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer
in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
Force Majeure. We shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from
causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war,
terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods,
accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or

Jurisdiction, without reference to conflict or choice of law principles. You agree that

applicable local laws in the jurisdiction from where you access or use the Sites.
SEVERABILITY; WAIVER.
If for any reason, any provision of these Terms is found unlawful, void or
unenforceable, it shall be deemed severed from these Terms and the remaining provisions
will continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Church to exercise or enforce
any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision.
