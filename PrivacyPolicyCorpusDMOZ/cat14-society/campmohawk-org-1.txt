Privacy Policy
Children’s Privacy
The Children’s Online Privacy Act (COPPA) protects the personal information of children under the age of 13. This applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms when they are tied to individually identifiable information. It is important for you to understand this law. We encourage you to read more about COPPA.
