Privacy
NewTechLaw strongly respects your privacy as our clients, friends, and visitors to this website. Since a different privacy and
confidentiality standard is imposed by law for clients and former clients, this policy applies only to information provided by this website.
NewTechLaw does not collect any personally identifying information from website visitors unless the visitor voluntarily submits such information.
To serve our clients better, this website may collect non-personally identifying information to monitor our website traffic and for statistical analysis purposes.
However, we protect the confidentiality and security of this information. We do not provide or sell any of this information to third parties except as otherwise required by law.
NewTechLaw reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time without advance notice by posting a new notice on this website. Any new policy will apply only to information collected thereafter.
