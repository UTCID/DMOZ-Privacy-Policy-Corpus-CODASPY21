Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization
(UCLA Law Review) by Paul Ohm, University of Colorado Law School. Computer scientists have recently undermined our faith in the privacy-protecting power of anonymization, the name for techniques for protecting the privacy of individuals in large databases by deleting information like names and social security numbers. These scientists have demonstrated they can often 'reidentify' or 'deanonymize' individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we will realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed. This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention. We must respond to the surprising failure of anonymization, and this Article provides the tools to do so.

EU - Commission proposes a comprehensive reform of data protection rules
(RAPID)
The European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU's data protection rules. The Commission's proposals update and modernise the principles enshrined in the 1995 Data Protection Directive to guarantee privacy rights in the future. They include a policy Communication setting out the Commission's objectives and two legislative proposals: a Regulation setting out a general EU framework for data protection and a Directive on protecting personal data processed for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences and related judicial activities.

FR - Conservation des données sur Internet : l'Asic se fâche
(ZDNet France)
Les grands noms de l´Internet s´associent derrière l´Asic pour demander l´annulation du décret qui impose aux sites web, aux réseaux sociaux, aux gestionnaires de boîtes mail de conserver un an durant les données de leurs utilisateurs. Les membres de l'Association des Services Internet Communautaires (ASIC) déposeront un recours en annulation devant le Conseil d'Etat. Les acteurs de l'internet contestent massivement un décret paru au journal officiel le 1er mars dernier, visant à obliger les sites à conserver pendant un an: "les nom et prénoms" de leurs clients, "les adresses postales associées", "les pseudonymes utilisés", "les adresses de courrier électronique ou de compte associées", "les numéros de téléphone" ou encore "le mot de passe ainsi que les données permettant de le vérifier ou de le modifier".

EU - The Privacy Platform Meeting: Reding outlines the way forward
(EDRI-gram)
On 16 March 2011, Sophie In't Veld's Privacy Platform met in the European Parliament to discuss the state of play for the review of the data protection directive. In her keynote speech, Ms. Reding said that data protection was her "top legislative priority". She plans to enhance control and build individual rights in four pillars: 1. The right to be forgotten. Individuals have the right to withdraw consent to data processing, and it will be up to the data controllers to prove the need to collect or retain personal data. 2. Greater transparency. For data subjects, the use, collection and retention of personal data must be made clear, intelligible, easy to understand and easy to find. She made particular reference to social networking services and children. 3. The third pillar is "privacy by default". Privacy settings often require considerable operational effort in order to be put in place. Such settings are not a reliable indication of consumers' consent. This needs to be changed. 4. Data protection regardless of data location. The data subject will enjoy protection, independent of the geographical region where the data is being collected and processed, without exception for third-party providers. See Commissioner Reding's keynote speech, Your data, your rights: safeguarding your rights in a connected world.

EU to force social network sites to enhance privacy
(Guardian) The European Union is to enshrine a "right to be forgotten online" to ensure that, among other things, prospective employers cannot find old Facebook party photos of someone wearing nothing but a lampshade. In a speech to the European parliament, the EU justice commissioner, Viviane Reding, warned companies such as Facebook that: "A US-based social network company that has millions of active users in Europe needs to comply with EU rules."

EU - Data Protection Reform Strategy: EDPS sets out his vision
(RAPID)
On 14 January 2011, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) issued an opinion on the Commission's Communication on the review of the EU legal framework for data protection. The EDPS suggests introducing a mandatory security breach notification covering all relevant sectors, as well as new rights, especially in the online environment, such as the right to be forgotten (to have one's data deleted or not further disseminated after a fixed period of time) and data portability (the ability to shift data from one place to another and not be tied to a particular system). Children's data should also be better protected.

ES - Google fights Spanish privacy order in court
(BBC)
Google has challenged Spain's data protection agency, the AEPD, in court over claims that its search engine invades personal privacy. The regulator had told the internet giant to delete links to websites that contain out of date or inaccurate information about individuals. But the company argues that it is publishers - and not search engines - that should be forced to take action. The case revolves around a ruling that some search results contravene the country's privacy laws.

Why 'Web Erasers' Can't Work
(Spiegel)
As part of its pitch to give people more personal privacy on the Web, the German government is encouraging development of software that sets expiration dates on photos and other private information.At the invitation of the German government, an IT professor has introduced software that allows people to set an expiration date for photos they post on Facebook or other sites. What it can't do, however, is prevent others from copying or stealing a person's personal data and posting it wherever they want on the Internet.

The Single Greatest Chart Ever (At Least if You Want to Know Where Your Personal Information Goes)
(ACLU)
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released a report (PDF) that provides an outstanding start on describing the problems of data collection both on and offline. Buried in that FTC report is a small gem: On pages 107 and 108 is Appendix C, a chart prepared by technologist Richard Smith which conveys all of the personal information collected about all of us and where it goes.

US administration proposes 'bill of rights' to protect online privacy
(OUT-LAW News)
The administration of US President Barack Obama may turn its back on its policy of allowing online publishers and advertisers to self-regulate and is proposing Government intervention to protect internet users' privacy. The Department of Commerce has published a report (88-page / 1MB PDF) recommending the creation of a privacy 'bill of rights' for internet users; mandatory privacy codes of conduct; and legal reform to take account of cloud computing. The Department of Commerce's policy framework says that the US Government should "consider establishing fair information practice principles comparable to a 'privacy bill of rights' for online consumers; consider developing enforceable privacy codes of conduct in specific sectors with stakeholders; create a Privacy Policy Office in the Department of Commerce"; [and] review the Electronic Communications Privacy Act for the cloud computing environment.

Why the EU needs new personal data protection rules
(RAPID)
Speech by Viviane Reding Vice-President of the European Commission, responsible for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Privacy matters, The European Data Protection and Privacy Conference Brussels, 30 November 2010. I want to introduce the "right to be forgotten". Social network sites are a great way to stay in touch with friends and share information. But if people no longer want to use a service, they should have no problem wiping out their profiles. The right to be forgotten is particularly relevant to personal data that is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected. This right should also apply when a storage period, which the user agreed to, has expired. Existing legislation has led to divergences between the national laws. Even when there is only one European issue, there is not always one European response. Take the example of Google StreetView and the collection of snippets of personal information from unsecured WiFi networks. This did not only prompt different responses by national data protection authorities but it also led the company to provide different remedies for individuals in different Member States. This situation runs counter to both of the two main objectives of the existing Data Protection Directive: ensuring the protection of a fundamental right and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the Single Market.

EU - Cloud computing and data protection
(RAPID)
Speech by Neelie Kroes, European Commission Vice-President for the Digital Agenda, Les Assises du Numérique conference, Université Paris-Dauphine, 25 November 2010. As summarised on Neelie Kroes' Twitter feed: Clear and robust data protection is a "must have" feature for cloud services. We we all deserve 2 things: 1) cloud suppliers protect personal data efficiently and transparently and 2) countries hosting cloud servers must have laws guaranteeing data protection with any limited security exceptions governed by rule of law.

The Trouble with Facebook's 'See Friendship' Feature
(Time)
Facebook normally catches flack for making private information available to advertisers. But last month, the social-networking site with half a billion users quietly added a feature that makes your private information available to the friends of your friends, which may be a much more nefarious group. A button called "See Friendship" aggregates onto a single page all of the information that two friends share: photos both people have been tagged in, events they have attended or are planning to attend, comments they have exchanged, etc.

UK - Information Commissioner will not fine Google over Wi-Fi data gathering
(OUT-LAW News)
UK privacy watchdog the Information Commissioner will not fine Google over unauthorised collection of personal data by its Street View cars, despite ruling that this was a "significant breach of the Data Protection Act". Google sent cars with roof-mounted cameras around the UK's cities last year to photograph the streets for its photo-map Street View service. Research by the Canadian Privacy Commissioner revealed that significant personal information, including whole emails; usernames; passwords; and addresses were gathered and stored by Google. The ICO has now announced that it will take some action against the company, but will stop short of imposing fines. Instead, Google will be made to sign an undertaking to improve its data protection practices and will face an audit of existing policies and practices. see also Google Street View has got off lightly (Guardian).

EU - European Commission sets out strategy to strengthen EU data protection rules
(Europa)
Controlling your information, having access to your data, being able to modify or delete it  these are essential rights that have to be guaranteed in today's digital world. To address these issues, the European Commission today set out a strategy on how to protect individuals' data in all policy areas, including law enforcement, while reducing red tape for business and guaranteeing the free circulation of data within the EU. This policy review will be used by the Commission with the results of a public consultation to revise the EUs 1995 Data Protection Directive. The Commission will then propose legislation in 2011. Under the review, data retained for law enforcement purposes should also be covered by the new legislative framework. The Commission is also reviewing the 2006 Data Retention Directive, under which companies are required to store communication traffic data for a period of between six months and two years. The Commission is calling on all stakeholders and the public to comment on the review's proposals until 15 January 2011. See also 'Right to be forgotten' proposed by European Commission
