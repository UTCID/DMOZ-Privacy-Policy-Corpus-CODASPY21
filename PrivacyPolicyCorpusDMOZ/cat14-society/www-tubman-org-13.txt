Parenting GroupTubman's parenting group is a trauma-informed group that provides women with a safe space to process the complexities of parenting through various traumatic life challenges, including substance abuse recovery, recovery from trauma caused by domestic violence, involvement with Child Protective Services, and child-parent separation and reconciliation. Each group member is offered support and feedback from other group members during weekly check ins. Learning happens largely through group conversation which is facilitated by therapists who weave evidence based parenting knowledge into the group dialogue.
This group is a required part of Co-Occurring Disorder treatment, and meetings will take place at Tubman Chrysalis Center. Call 612.870.2426 for more information.
