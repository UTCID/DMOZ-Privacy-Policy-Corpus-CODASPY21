Teachings
Love
Serve
Conserve
Practice
Amma has never asked anyone
to change their religion.
Only to go deeper
into their values or faith,
and live by those
essential principles.
Love
"Be like the honeybee who gathers only nectar wherever it goes. Seek the goodness that is found in everyone."
Serve
"Don't be discouraged by your incapacity to dispel darkness from the world. Light your candle and step forward."
Conserve
"Where did we go wrong? The real mistake we commit lies in our inability to differentiate between requirements and luxuries."
