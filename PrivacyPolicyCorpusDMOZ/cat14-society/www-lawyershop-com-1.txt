WE DO NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEBSITE.
This policy describes the information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Einstein Industries, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively referred herein as “COMPANY”) and applies to COMPANY’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by COMPANY on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various Third Party websites, and (c) to COMPANY's other information collection. COMPANY is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of its Clients or other Third Party websites or applications.
1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information. COMPANY collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, COMPANY or a Third Party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to COMPANY, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). COMPANY may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this website. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to COMPANY or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from COMPANY or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to COMPANY.
1.2 Site Membership or Registration. To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from COMPANY, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive email marketing from COMPANY, whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise. We collect information in certain portions of our Website, which may include your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time or where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you submit to COMPANY remains your property, but by submitting that information to COMPANY, you grant COMPANY, the right to use that information for marketing purposes. COMPANY, may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell or lease the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring retail opportunities to our members. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. In addition, COMPANY reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event COMPANY believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its AUP the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if COMPANY is sold or acquired, or when COMPANY deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when COMPANY, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.
"Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for COMPANY's services, either via registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing COMPANY collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number, activity, interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services.
1.3 Other Information. COMPANY may also obtain your information from individuals when you provide it to another party and COMPANY enters into a business relationship with such third party to purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquire the information. Such information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided. When such business relationships occur, COMPANY seeks assurances from the other party that they have obtained your permission to transfer the information to COMPANY and provide offers to you.
1.4 Requests for Assistance or Service. Other occasions when COMPANY obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by COMPANY or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through COMPANY's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a COMPANY’s service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. COMPANY currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, COMPANY may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows COMPANY to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in COMPANY’s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src="x"> programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows COMPANY to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, COMPANY might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in COMPANY's database, visits the cosmetic website, COMPANY receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and COMPANY would then update Jane’s profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics. COMPANY may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, COMPANY also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in COMPANY's database.
(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is COMPANY's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, COMPANY strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
(d) Usage Tracking and Log Files. COMPANY tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.
(e) Optional Registration. COMPANY may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services.
(f) Feedback and Inquiries. You have the ability to contact COMPANY to provide us with their feedback. COMPANY uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues.
(g) IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.
(h) Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as a “Clear GIF” or “1-by-1 Pixel” on the Site and in email communications with users. A Clear GIF or “graphic interface format” is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in email messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to email messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative email presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.
1.6 Outside Information. COMPANY may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of COMPANY including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
1.7 Individual Information. As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information COMPANY gathers or receives about individuals.
1.8 No Information Collected from Children. COMPANY will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If COMPANY obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, COMPANY has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. COMPANY is designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
1.9 Credit Card Information. Company may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from COMPANY. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to COMPANY, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. COMPANY will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
1.10 Links to External Websites. COMPANY’s emails and websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links. Your information may be passed from COMPANY’s database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website). COMPANY is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website they visit.
2. Use of Individual Information.
2.1 General Use. The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how COMPANY currently uses Individual Information, but COMPANY may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, COMPANY may update this policy from time to time. COMPANY may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.
2.2 Email and Unsubscribe Policy. COMPANY uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals and companies including its clients. COMPANY may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all COMPANY’s email lists, a person must send an email to unsubscribe@einsteinindustries.com.
COMPANY's unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by COMPANY on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.
You should also note that unsubscribing from COMPANY’s electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber’s information from any Third Party business associates and licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from COMPANY, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.
2.3 Content of Email Messages. In certain commercial email messages sent by COMPANY, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to COMPANY. The "Subject:" line of COMPANY email messages will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to COMPANY.
2.4 Solicited Email. COMPANY only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from COMPANY or to individuals who have agreed on a Third Party website to receive email from Third Parties. As such, COMPANY does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to COMPANY 's email messages.
2.5 Targeted Advertising. COMPANY uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet, COMPANY uses Technology Information to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and COMPANY attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. COMPANY may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.
2.6 Telemarketing. COMPANY uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. By registering and using this Site, You acknowledge that the processing of your individual information may involve the transfer of such PII from within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that within the European Union. We may use individual information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.
2.7 Wireless Addresses. If the email address you provide to COMPANY is a wireless email address, you agree to receive messages at such address from COMPANY or its business associates (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of this policy).  You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages.
