When you visit the Site, you may provide us with two types of information:
(i) Personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis; and
(ii) Website use information collected on an aggregate basis as you browse our Site.
The Site automatically logs certain information about every request made of it (see below for more details). This information is used for system administration, bug tracking, and for producing usage statistics. The logged information is deleted each calendar month (or not later than 31 days).
Relevant subsets of this data may be passed to computer security teams as part of investigations of computer misuse involving this site or other computing equipment in the University. Data may be passed to the administrators of other computer systems to enable investigation of problems accessing this site or of system misconfigurations. Data may incidentally be included in information passed to contractors and computer maintenance organisations working for the University, in which case it will be covered by appropriate non-disclosure agreements. Otherwise the logged information is not passed to any third party except if required by law. Summary statistics are extracted from this data and some of these may be made publicly available, but those that are do not include information from which individuals could be identified.
The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the Sites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Sites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers which may be based in other jurisdictions. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for the Faculty and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.  For more information see the Cookies page.
Logged data
The following data may automatically logged for each request:
(i) The name or network address of the computer making the request. Note that under some (but not all) circumstances it may be possible to infer from this the identity of the person making the request. Note also that the data recorded may be that of a web proxy rather than that of the originating client;
(ii) The date and time of connection;
(iii) The HTTP request, which contains the identification of the document requested;
(iv) The status code of the request (success or failure etc.);
(v) The number of data bytes sent in response;
(vi) The contents of the HTTP Referrer header supplied by the browser; and
(vii) The content of the HTTP User-Agent header supplied by the browser.
Logging of additional data may be enabled temporarily from time to time for specific purposes. In addition, the computers on which the Site is hosted keep records of attempts (authorised and unauthorised) to use them for purposes other than access to the web server. This data typically includes the date and time of the attempt, the service to which access was attempted, the name or network address of the computer making the connection, and may include details of what was done or was attempted to be done.
