Effective Date: January 1, 2020
We at American Achievement Corporation (“AAC,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected when you visit any of our websites, which include, without limitation, http://www.balfour.com/, http://www.artcarved.com/, http://gradgowns.us/, http://www.delavoy.ca/, https://www.gaspard.ca/, https://www.buildagrad.ca/, https://buildagrad.com/, https://www.keepsakebowling.com/, http://www.balfoursports.com/, http://www.universityphoto.com/ , https://www.artneedle.com/, http://willsieco.com/, http://gradgowns.com/, http://mygraduationstore.com/, and http://www.gradimages.com, (“Websites”), access our mobile app, which may be accessible through mobile devices and tablets (the “Mobile App”), access and use our services provided through the Websites and the Mobile App (“Services”), or purchase our products (“Products”). The Websites and the Mobile App are collectively referred to as the “Online and Digital Properties.”
Acceptance of Terms
By visiting our Websites, accessing our Mobile App, accessing and using our Services, and/or purchasing our Products, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.
What Information We Collect/Receive
We collect and/or receive the following categories of information:
Contact Information
When you contact us through the “Contact Us” page, or sign up to receive special offers & promotions, or sign up to become a Registered User, you will be asked to provide certain information which may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, and student’s name if you are registering on behalf of a student (collectively, the “Contact Information”).
If you sign in using your Facebook or any other social media account, you are authorizing AAC to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Facebook, Inc., or such other social media company could provide to AAC through its Application Programming Interface. Such information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, username, profile picture, unique social media identifier and access token, and e-mail address.

For orders submitted through the Online and Digital Properties, the Billing Information is collected, stored and processed by our third-party payment vendors.
You may also submit orders by using our paper order forms. If you submit orders using our paper order forms, you will be required to fill in the Billing Information on our paper forms.

You may decline to allow us to collect such Geolocational Information, in which case we will not be able to provide certain features of the Mobile App to you.
Other Information

The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.

disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at 1-800-BALFOUR (800-225-3687)

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
