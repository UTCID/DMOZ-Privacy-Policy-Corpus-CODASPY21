Whistleblower Policy
Adopted by the Board of Directors on 10-25-2016
Asheville Humane Society (AHS) is committed to high standards of ethical, moral and legal business conduct. Employees and representatives of the organization must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling their responsibilities and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
Reporting Responsibility
This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable employees, officers, directors, and others to raise serious ethical and legal concerns internally so that AHS can address and correct inappropriate conduct and actions. Each director, volunteer, and employee of Asheville Humane Society has an obligation to report violations in accordance with this Whistleblower Policy.  All reports will be kept as confidentially as possible.
Any persons (herein after referred to as the complainant) who have a reasonable belief that unlawful activity or a Reportable Violation, as defined below, has occurred, may make a report pursuant to the Procedure for Reporting outlined below.
“Reportable Violations” with respect to this policy are defined as:
Unlawful activity, including but not limited to theft, bribery, and fraud;
Incorrect financial reporting; or
Unethical conduct, including but not limited to a conflict of interest.
No Retaliation
It is AHS policy not to retaliate against an employee who, in good faith, makes a report of a Reportable Violation. In line with AHS’ commitment to open communication and its Open Door Policy, this Whistleblower Policy provides an avenue for employees to raise good faith concerns about Reportable Violations without fear of reprisal.  AHS will not retaliate against or penalize any person for making a good faith claim or report of a Reportable Violation or for in good faith providing information regarding a Reportable Violation or any claim of a Reportable Violation.  An employee who retaliates against an individual who has reported a Reportable Violation in good faith will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
1.         Procedure for Reporting.
As set forth in its Open Door Policy, AHS believes in an open communication between employees and management.  If you believe that a Reportable Violation has occurred, you are required, without fear of reprisal, to report it promptly to the Executive Director.  If the Executive Director is unavailable, is the subject of your complaint, or if you otherwise believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, you should immediately contact the Controller or the Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Reportable Violations may be made in writing.
All other work related issues should be brought to the attention of management in accordance with AHS Open Door policy.
2.         Investigation of Reported Violations.
AHS will carefully and promptly investigate each complaint of a Reportable Violation and will take corrective action when appropriate.  This may include disciplinary action, up to including termination, and/or the reporting of such conduct to the appropriate legal authorities.
In the event of a Reportable Violation, the Executive Director will notify the Chair of the Board of Directors who will designate an Investigative Committee to investigate the complaint and take the appropriate action.  In appointing the Investigative Committee, the Chair of the Board of Directors will not appoint any individual who may have a conflict of interest.  Upon the completion of its investigation, the Investigative Committee will recommend to the Board of Directors the appropriate action, if any.
Distribution of Policy
It is the responsibility of the Executive Director to provide this policy to new staff and new board members during their orientation to the organization.  In addition, the Executive Director will ensure that this policy is provided and made available to existing staff and board members through the organization’s internal distribution mechanisms.
