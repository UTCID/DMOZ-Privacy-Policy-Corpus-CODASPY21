account preferences, including your consent to receive our newsletter or other offers;
from our corporate and business customers, the name(s) and title(s) of the person(s) authorized to use the account.
This information is collected and used for the following purposes:
To establish and maintain a commercial relationship with you and to provide you with products and services. Personal contact and credit card information is required to process your purchases. We use your account information to identify you when you log in, to allow you to set up and access your account and download forms and documents which you have purchased. This information is used only for these purposes and is only retained in transaction records required for internal management and auditing purposes, unless you provide your express consent for some other use or unless we are required by law to allow a court or other third party to access it.
To understand your needs and preferences. We maintain a record of the products and services you receive from us, and we may ask you for additional information so that we can serve you better.
To provide you with information you have requested. Your email address will be used to send you our newsletters and mailings ONLY WITH YOUR EXPRESS CONSENT. You can provide this consent when you set up your account. You can withdraw your consent for such mailings at any time.
To develop, enhance or provide new products and services. We may from time to time conduct surveys and research, requesting input from our visitors to help us improve our website, products and services in an effort to serve you better. Your participation in such surveys is voluntary, and in some cases you may have the option to participate anonymously. However, your name, address, email and telephone number may be required to take advantage of bonuses or other benefits which are available to survey participants, in which case your contact information will only be used for notification and fulfillment purposes.
To manage and administer our business. Our server logs record statistical information, such as visitors' IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, web pages requested, and identify visitors by categories such as domains and browser types. These statistics are used strictly for internal informational purposes on an aggregate basis and they do not contain any personal identifying information (name, address, etc).
To meet legal, regulatory, security and processing requirements (such as in response to a court order), and otherwise as permitted or required by law.
If we intend to use personal information for purposes not identified to you or as set out above, these other purposes will be described to you at the time that we collect the information and prior to any use being made of that information. We will not use your information for any other purpose without your express consent.

Third Party Access to Information
We may share information with third parties who perform certain functions on our behalf, such as providing marketing assistance, analyzing data, preparing and maintaining site content, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These agents have access to customer information only as required in order to help them perform their functions on our behalf, but they are not allowed to use that information for any unlawful purpose and must keep such information confidential and not act in violation of any applicable privacy laws.
We also work closely with our affiliates, and in some cases we offer services or sell documents jointly with these affiliates. When you purchase documents or services that are provided jointly by MegaDox.com and one of its affiliates, we share our customer information with that affiliate with respect to your purchase.

MegaDox.com is not in the business of selling customer information to others. Our customer information is not available for sale to any outside entity. Customer information is a valuable business asset. If for any reason MegaDox.com transfers or divests itself of its business assets, all relevant customer information will be transferred as part of those business assets.
