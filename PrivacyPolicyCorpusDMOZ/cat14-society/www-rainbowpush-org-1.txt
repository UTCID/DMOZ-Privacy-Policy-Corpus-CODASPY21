PRIVACY STATEMENT
Privacy Statement
Your privacy is important to us. When you visit our site, we do not collect any personal, identifying information about you unless you volunteer that information using a form. We do not use information from forms for commercial purposes, nor do we share this information with any other organization. You will not receive any email from us as a result of using our website unless you request information and supply us with your email address.
In addition to information you choose to provide us through our form, we gather information about how our site is used. For instance, our web server automatically collects each visitor’s domain name (the internet name of the organization through which the visitor connects to us; examples of domain names include ici.org, sec.gov, and aol.com). We also collect aggregate information about user visits, such as when the site is visited most often and which areas of the site are accessed most often. We use both kinds of information – the information you volunteer through forms and the information we automatically collect – to analyze how to improve our site. We also use this information to compile aggregate statistics on how the site is used.
