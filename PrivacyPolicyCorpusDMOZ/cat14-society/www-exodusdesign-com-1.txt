We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as your name, address, phone, email), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, name, address, email or phone number to contact you) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 952.432.7956 or via email info@exodusdesign.com.
Orders
We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name, phone, and shipping address). If we have questions about your order, we’ll use this information to contact you.
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.
We also partner with other parties to provide printing services. When you request these services, we will share your name, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide printing services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing printing services.
