Frequently Asked Questions
2020-2021 Academic Year
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIPOP) In 1993, the province of Nova Scotia enacted the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Its purpose is to make public bodies more open and accountable to the public in the way they acquire, use and dispose of information.
This is achieved in a number of ways including:
giving the public a right of access to records in the custody and control of the University, subject only to limited and specific exemptions;
giving individuals a right of access to personal information held by the University about them and allowing them the opportunity to request a correction to said information;
specifying limited exemptions to the right of access;
ensuring appropriate collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
The Act also provides the opportunity for individuals to request information, making public bodies directly accountable to each citizen.
A complete copy of the Nova Scotia Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act is available on the government web site at https://oipc.novascotia.ca/legislation.
Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents (PIPEDA)PIPEDA, which came into force January 1, 2001, establishes new rules for privacy. The rules recognize the rights of individuals to control the use of their personal information. The rules also impose obligations on organizations to protect personal information in a manner that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. This legislation protects the privacy rights of all Canadians as it applies to every organization that collects, uses or discloses personal information in the course of commercial activities.
A complete copy of Bill C-6, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act is available on the Privacy Commissioner’s web site at https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/.
Privacy ActUnder the federal Privacy Act, individuals can request access to their own individual information held in federal information banks, including those held by Statistics Canada.
Notification of Disclosure of Personal Information to the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission (MPHEC)
The MPHEC collects student identification information (student’s name, student ID number), student contact information (address and telephone number), student demographic characteristics, and enrolment information from Mount Saint Vincent University.
Enrolment and demographic information is used by MPHEC in the preparation of basic statistics, as well as to understand student pathways through to graduation, and the factors that affect these pathways. The information assists governments and Mount Saint Vincent University in decision-making and in enhancing the post-secondary learning environment.
Personally-identifying information is used only for limited purposes:
To create record linkages between data from different Mount Saint Vincent University in order to track student pathways among Mount Saint Vincent University. Once records are linked, personal information is deleted from the research data file.
To communicate with Mount Saint Vincent University and Statistics Canada during the data validation process. Compile a student/graduate contact list for an MPHEC survey
The legal authority for these activities is provided by a data sharing agreement between Mount Saint Vincent University and the MPHEC, as well as the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission Act. The Act requires that all data received by the Commission is kept confidential, and ensures the protection of personal information. More information about the MPHEC may be found at www.mphec.ca. A copy of its Standard for Maintaining Confidentiality is available here: http://www.mphec.ca/general/confidentiality.aspx

Email: mphec@mphec.ca
Notification of Disclosure of Personal Information to Statistics Canada
The federal Statistics Act provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal information held by Mount Saint Vincent University. The information may be used for statistical purposes only, and the confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student.
Students who do not wish to have their personally-identifying information submitted to MPHEC or Statistics Canada will notify Mount Saint Vincent University by contacting:
