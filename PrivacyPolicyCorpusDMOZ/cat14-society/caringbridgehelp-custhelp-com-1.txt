Find someone's site
CaringBridge authors control their own privacy settings. Some prefer to be accessible to anyone who visits CaringBridge and searchable by name. Others prefer more privacy and choose one of our other options for finding, visiting and posting on their site.
If the site is searchable by name, you can find the site by starting on our home page, www.caringbridge.org, enter the person's name or site name, where it says Visit a Friend's Website and click on the search button. There is also a "Search" option in the upper right corner of most CaringBridge pages.
- This will take you to a list of Search Results. If the author has elected to make their site searchable, their site will be listed among the search results. Click on Visit Site.
- If you can't find the website you are looking for, you may need to reach out to the patient or a loved one for an invitation or a direct link to the website.
Tips:
Depending on the Author's privacy level, you may need to be registered to view their site, to post messages on their site, or to print a copy of their Journal.
