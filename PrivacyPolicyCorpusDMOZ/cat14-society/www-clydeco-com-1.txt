Data Protection & Privacy
We provide businesses with full service data protection and privacy advice across all industry sectors, enabling clients to focus their resources on other business needs.
Data privacy and protection is absolutely fundamental to all types of organisation due to the increasing threat of malicious hackers with the ability to leverage and monetise information.
Multi-national organisations face a web of complex and conflicting laws and regulations surrounding the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of information.
This requires careful attention to data privacy at every stage of the business cycle to avoid the negative publicity surrounding data breaches.
Our team brings together a wealth of experience across a range of sectors and industries to keep you on the cutting edge of developments in the industry. Our strong working relationships with the regulators and industry bodies enable us to resolve issues and provide practical commercial advice.
We advise a wide range of businesses including retailers, insurers, hospitals, information service providers, technology start-ups, financial institutions, educational institutions and governments across the world on the full range of data issues.
