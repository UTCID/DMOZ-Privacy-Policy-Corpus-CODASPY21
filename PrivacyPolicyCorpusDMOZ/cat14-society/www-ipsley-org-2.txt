COVID-19 Privacy Notice
Online List of Clergy, Staff and Visitors to Church buildings
This notice explains how information about you will be used temporarily by the Parochial Church Council (PCC) of Parish of Ipsley during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis so we can take your booking and at the same time put in place a list of clergy, staff and visitors to the church building/s, as requested by the Government in support of NHS Test and Trace.
1. Who we are
The PCC of Parish of Ipsley is the data controller (contact details in section 7. below).  This means we decide how your personal data is used and why.
2. The information we collect about you and why we need it
We collect your data in order to process your booking of a visit to one of the churches in the parish (Christ Church, Matchborough; St. John's, Greenlands or St. Peter's Ipsley).  However, we are also collecting your data for the purpose of supporting NHS Test and Trace, as requested by the Government.
Although we may have your contact details already the Covid-19 pandemic has created a unique situation and additional reasons for us to collect the name and contact telephone number of all clergy, staff and visitors who use/visit our church building/s in order to support NHS Test and Trace.
This is specifically in relation to contact tracing, which is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission and the investigation of local outbreaks.
In summary, Test and Trace:
provides testing for anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus to find out if they have the virus;
gets in touch with anyone who has had a positive test result to help them share information about any close recent contacts they have had; and
alerts those contacts, where necessary, and notifies them they need to self-isolate to help stop the spread of the virus.
This is voluntary, and you can opt out of letting us share your details with NHS Test and Trace.  We will still accept your booking.
For bookings: When booking a place we will need to know the number of people in your group and a contact number or email for the group leader. We will not use these details for any other purpose than keeping a record of those coming to the service and contacting you about the service.
3. Lawful basis
We will use your information lawfully, as explained below:
Consent – We need your consent in order to collect your name and contact telephone number and share this with NHS Test and Trace if requested.  You will give us your consent by providing your details in the Form.
Explicit consent – We need your explicit written consent to collect your data on the basis that you may have revealed a religious belief by using our church building/s. You will give us your explicit consent by completing the Form.
You can withdraw your consent at any time after giving your details by letting us know you no longer want us to keep or share your personal data for this purpose, however, once we have given your details to Test and Trace we will no longer be able to prevent processing.  To contact us, please see our contact details at 7. below.
4. Sharing your data
Your personal data will be treated as strictly confidential and will only be shared with NHS Test and Trace if requested.
Personal data that is collected will be used only to share with NHS Test and Trace. It will only be used for the purpose specified in this Privacy Notice.
5. Data Retention
We will keep your name and telephone number for a maximum of 21 days (from the date of the service) and will dispose of it after this period.
6. Your Legal Rights
Unless subject to an exemption under the GDPR or DPA 2018, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data: -
The right to be informed about any data we hold about you;
The right to request a copy of your personal data which we hold about you;
The right to withdraw your consent at any time, while the [name of church body] still has your data;
The right to request that we correct any personal data if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date;

The right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or processing of your personal data, to request a restriction is placed on further processing;
