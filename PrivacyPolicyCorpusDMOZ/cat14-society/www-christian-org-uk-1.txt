In most cases, this has been by filling in and returning a post card “Keep me informed: please add me to your mailing list”, or by joining our mailing list via our website. Whichever mechanism is used, a person has the choice of joining our post mailing list, our email mailing list, or both. The information provided includes:name and titleaddress including postcode, and/oremail addressSome of our supporters may also provide:a telephone numberthe name of their church or denominationan indication of whether they are a church leader or a studentThose who are on our mailing list are categorised as our supporters. By signing up to receive our mailings, our supporters have regular contact with us.We also collect the following information:amount and frequency (if giving regularly) of donations, gift aid status, and partial bank details (but not sufficient to effect a transaction)information about our relationship with supportersinformation provided by those who contact us for advice or with enquiriesInformation we get from other sourcesWe sometimes use legal publicly available sources to obtain information. For example:a church website to obtain the contact details for a minister who we may wish to contact with a view to holding a public meeting in his churchobtain from public directories the telephone number for a supporter if we have cause to contact them and do not already have a numberto ensure that a supporter’s contact details are up to dateto conduct appropriate due diligence to ensure there is no reputational or financial risk to accepting a particular donationHow we use personal informationWe use personal information to:administer mailings to our supporters, to inform them to pray and actmanage enquiries from supporters and those who contact us, and keep a record of contact and correspondenceoperate our advice service and maintain appropriate recordsmanage our volunteersadminister donations, thank donors, and maintain our own accounts and recordsplan meetings and events to keep our supporters and others informedmake an occasional live telephone call to a supporter for specfic time-sensitive purposesimprove our communications, campaigns and servicesWe endeavour to keep personal information up to date. This includes monitoring returned mail to let us know if a person no longer lives at the address we hold for them. We also use public sources to make sure we do not send communications to the wrong place or person.We occasionally run a petition on our website for the purpose of raising support for a particular issue. Petition entries are not published or shared with a third party unless otherwise stated. Unless a person subsequently asks us to remove their petition entry, we keep a record of this entry for verification purposes until the petition closes, but do not otherwise process this data. At the conclusion of the petition, we destroy the petition data using secure means. If a person also signs up to receive emails from us, then their personal information will be processed for the purposes of sending them the emails they have requested.If a person has applied to work for us, their personal information will only be used for the purposes of recruitment and processing their application. Applicant information is kept for six months after completion of the recruitment process.The exterior of our office is monitored by CCTV for security reasons. All recordings are destroyed after three months.Our responsibilitiesWe only send email mailings about our work and issues to those who have given their consent to us to do so. However, a person can change their mind at any time and withdraw their consent. Every email has a link to help the recipient unsubscribe if they wish to stop receiving emails.In all other cases the law allows us to hold and process the personal information of supporters and others if it is in our legitimate interests to do so. We rely on our legitimate interests to keep our supporters’ details and maintain our mailing list, to write to those who have indicated their wish to receive our postal mailings, to process and administer our donations, provide an advice service to those who seek it, and to keep appropriate records. Relying on our legitimate interests mean that we carry out an exercise to check that we will not cause harm to the data subject by processing their data, that the processing is not overly intrusive and that we will only process data in a way which is described in this privacy notice. Our legitimate interests involve furthering our charitable objects of advancing the Christian faith and education though providing information and advice and providing the service our supporters might reasonably expect.We may on occasions use the church or denominational information provided by some of our supporters, including whether they are a church leader, to inform our work. Our legitimate interests in doing this include exercising a general awareness that some of our publications are likely to be appropriate to the broad demographic of our supporters, and informing our development work, e.g. where we might be able to hold a particular supporter meeting. In so far as such church details are special category data, we also rely on our legitimate activities as a not for profit body with a religious aim.We also rely upon our legitimate interests to telephone our supporters if necessary. This may occasionally involve obtaining a telephone number from publicly available sources in the terms set out above. We will not telephone anyone who subscribes to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) unless they have consented. We never ask for donations on the phone.Advice serviceOccasionally, we are contacted by parents who seek advice in relation to issues which might relate to their children. Wherever possible, we refer to their children in anonymous terms.In the course of providing advice, it may sometimes be necessary to process special category data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.SecurityWe keep personal information secure with appropriate measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information.We use secure server software to encrypt financial and personal information we collect online. However, the transmission of data across the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur whilst data is being transferred.Sharing informationWe will not share the personal information we hold with another organisation for their own purposes and we will never sell personal information for any reason whatsoever.There may be occasions where it is necessary to share personal information where it is required by law or to respond to any legal or regulatory action. We will provide information to HMRC on gift aided donations since we have a legal obligation to provide this information.There are also a few situations where our legitimate interests involve us sharing some supporter information with service providers who are contracted to fulfil specific services for us. For example, we use a mailing house to send our post and the email service MailChimp to deliver to our supporters the emails they have signed up to receive. However, we remain in control of the information and the company is not allowed to do anything with the information other than what we have requested. The service also enables us to gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies including gifs to help us monitor and improve our mailings (see: https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/).Many of our donations are processed through Charity Aid Foundation.Worldwide transfer of dataIf it is ever desirable to transfer data outside of the EEA, we ensure that robust data-sharing agreements are in place. For example, MailChimp hosts its data in the US, but it has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.How long we keep dataWe keep information in line with our data retention policy.Our relationship with our supporters and donors is generally long term, so we keep their personal information for as long as we need it to maintain that relationship or keeping the information is otherwise necessary. We take into account our need to meet any legal, statutory and regulatory obligations. These reasons vary from one piece of information to another. For example, we keep information relating to donations and gift aid for seven years.If a supporter unsubscribes from our emails they are removed from our mailing list. Relying upon legitimate interest, a list of unsubscribed email addresses may be kept to ensure that we do not send emails to those who no longer wish to receive them.Our need to use personal information is assessed on a regular basis and we dispose of data securely, using specialist companies to do this work for us if necessary.CookiesWhat are cookies?Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to a user’s device when they visit a website.Why do we use cookies?We use cookies for the operation, security, monitoring and improvement of our website.
