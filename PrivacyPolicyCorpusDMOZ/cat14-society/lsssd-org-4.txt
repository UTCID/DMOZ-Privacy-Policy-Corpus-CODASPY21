Lasting GiftsIf you want to give a gift that will serve the needs of generations to come, give to the LSS Foundation, either now - with an immediate gift, or plan to give even beyond your lifetime - with a planned gift. The Foundation works like an endowment fund that allows your gift to live in perpetuity (only the earnings of the fund are utilized) so the Foundation continues to grow and your gift continues giving.
Many people include the organizations that mean the most to them during their lifetime in their giving plans-creating a legacy for the future. Please read further about the LSS Foundation, planned giving ideas, and the Founders Family (our planned giving recognition society).
The LSS Foundation is a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and all gifts to the LSS Foundation are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law. Our federal tax id is 46-0423090.
We would love to visit with you about a gift, planned giving, the LSS Foundation, the Founders Family or really, anything you'd like to talk about. Just give us a call. Together we like to reach all the corners, rural roads, and off-beaten paths of South Dakota to meet the incredible people who support the mission and ministry of LSS. Invite us for coffee, meet us in town, or just call for some information.
