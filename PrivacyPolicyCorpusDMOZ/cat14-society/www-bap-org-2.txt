Miscellaneous
These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and BAP with respect to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Headings are for reference only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. BAP’s failure to act with respect to any failure by you or others to comply with these Terms does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar failures. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of BAP, and any assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be null and void. BAP may assign, transfer, sublicense or delegate our rights or obligations under these Terms either in whole or in part, at any time, at our sole discretion, and without your consent. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms.
