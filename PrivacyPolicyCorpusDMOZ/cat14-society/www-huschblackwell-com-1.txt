For example, we use cloud data storage, payroll processors, accounting software, payment processors and marketing service providers.
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with the sites and services, compile reports on their activity, and provide other services related to their activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your internet protocol address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor and any referring website.

“Do not track” signals

Notice to Nevada residents
Nevada law allows Nevada residents to opt out of the sale of certain types of personal information. Subject to a number of exceptions, Nevada law defines “sale” to mean the exchange of certain types of personal information for monetary consideration to a person for the person to license or sell the information to additional persons. We do not currently sell personal information as defined in the Nevada law. However, if you are a Nevada resident, you still may submit a verified request to opt out of sales and we will record your instructions and incorporate them in the future if our policy changes. Opt-out requests may be sent to: privacy@huschblackwell.com.
Notice to California residents
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires that we provide California residents with a privacy policy that contains a comprehensive description of our online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of personal information and of the rights of California residents regarding their personal information.
The CCPA defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Personal information does not include information that is publicly available, deidentified or aggregate. For purposes of this notice to California residents section, we will refer to this information as “personal information.”
Right to know about personal information collected, disclosed or sold
Your right
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we have collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request. This right includes the right to request any or all of the following:

How to submit a request to know

Our process for verifying a request to know
We will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request. Our verification process may differ depending on whether you maintain a password-protected account with us.
If you maintain a password-protected account, we may verify your identity through existing authentication practices available through your account. Prior to disclosing the requested information, we will ask you to reauthenticate yourself with respect to that account.
If you do not maintain a password-protected account, or if you are an account holder but we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity with your account, we will verify your identity as follows:
Request to know categories of personal information: we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty by verifying at least two data points that you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities.
Request to know specific pieces of personal information: we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty by verifying at least three pieces of Personal Information previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities. In addition, you will be required to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the individual whose Personal Information is being requested.
Collection of personal information
The following table presents the categories of personal information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which that information was collected and the categories of third parties with whom we shared that Personal Information for the 12 months preceding the effective date of this privacy policy.

Right to request deletion of personal information
Your right
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we delete the personal information about you that we have collected or maintain. However, a business is not required to comply with a request to delete if it is necessary for the business to maintain the personal information in order to, for example, complete a transaction, detect security incidents, comply with a legal obligation or otherwise use the Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.
How to submit a request to delete
You may submit a request to delete by completing our online request form available here, emailing privacy@huschblackwell.com or by calling us at 1-800-711-5413.
If you submit a request to delete online, you will be asked to confirm separately that you want your personal information deleted.
Our process for verifying a request
We will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request. Our verification process may differ depending on whether you maintain a password-protected account with us.
If you maintain a password-protected account, we may verify your identity through existing authentication practices available through your account. Prior to deleting the personal information, we will ask you to reauthenticate yourself with respect to that account.
If you do not maintain a password-protected account, or if you are an account holder but we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity with your account, we will verify your identity either to a reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm to you by unauthorized deletion.
We will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty by verifying at least two data points that you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities.
We will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty by verifying at least three pieces of Personal Information previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities. In addition, you will be required to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the individual whose personal information is being requested.
If we are unable to verify your identity to the applicable standard, we will treat your request to delete as a request to opt out of the sale of the personal information that you provided as part of processing the request to delete. See the following section for a description of the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.
Notice of right to opt-out of sale of personal information
Your right
If you are a California resident, you have the right to direct a business that sells (or may in the future sell) your personal information to stop selling your personal information and to refrain from doing so in the future.
The CCPA defines “sell” to mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a California resident’s personal information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.
How to submit a request to opt out
You may submit a request to opt-out of sales through our interactive webform available by clicking on this link: “Do Not Sell My Personal Information.” You also may submit a request by emailing privacy@huschblackwell.com or calling 1.800.711.5413.
How we process a request to opt out
We will act upon your request to opt-out within 15 days from the date that you submit the request. The CCPA does not require that we verify the identity of individuals who submit requests to opt out of sales. However, we may deny the request if we have a good-faith, reasonable and documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If we deny the request on this basis, we will notify the requesting party and provide an explanation why we believe the request is fraudulent.
Right to nondiscrimination for the exercise of a California resident’s privacy rights
We will not discriminate against California residents if they exercise any of the rights provided in the CCPA as described in this section notice to California Residents. As such, we will not deny goods or services to that California resident; charge different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the California resident; or suggest that the California resident will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. However, we are permitted to charge a California resident a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by the individual’s data.
Authorized agents
California residents may use an authorized agent to submit a request to know, delete or opt out of sales on your behalf.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or request to delete, we may require that: (1) the authorized agent provide proof of your written permission; and (2) you verify your identity directly with us. These requirements do not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt out of sales, you will need to provide that authorized agent with written permission to do so and submit written proof to us that the agent has been authorized to act on your behalf.
Shine the light law
We do not disclose personal information obtained through our site or services to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Accordingly, we have no obligations under California Civil Code § 1798.83.
