Law Clerk Program (APR 6)
Updated: Dec. 2, 2020
APR 6 Law Clerk ProgramThe Law Clerk Program is an alternative to law school authorized under rule 6 of the Washington Supreme Courts Admission and Practice Rule (APR) 6. It is a four-year program designed to provide educational and practical experience through a combination of work and study with an experienced lawyer or judge. Completion of the program would qualify you to take the Washington lawyer bar examination pursuant to the requirements under APR 3(b) Qualifications for Bar Examination.
News and UpdatesOn June 28, 2020, the Washington State Bar Association approved a Resolution affirming the value of the APR 6 Law Clerk Program.
QualificationsTo qualify for the program applicants must have good moral character, a bachelor's degree, and regular paid full-time employment in Washington state with a lawyer or judge who has at least 10 years of active experience and will serve as the applicant's primary tutor. Applicants find their own employment; neither the WSBA nor the Law Clerk Board can assist with finding an employer/tutor. Employment is a requirement to apply for the program. Applicants must have qualifying employment with the tutor when applying. Employment offered contingent upon enrollment in the program is not acceptable.To ApplyIMPORTANT NOTICE:We are currently working on a new online admissions portal. As such, Law Clerk Program applications will be online only beginning Jan. 15, 2021. Paper or PDF applications will not be accepted after Dec. 7, 2020 .Read the APR 6 Rules and Regulations Pamphlet to be sure the law clerk and tutor applicants are eligible.Complete the Application Packet and send it with the $100 application fee by the appropriate deadline.Applications are due 60 days prior to each Law Clerk Board meeting. WSBA may ask you for more information. WSBA will assign an individual Law Clerk Board member to meet with you before the board's review. You will be notified of the board's decision within one week after the board's meeting.

APR 6 Law Clerk Program Application MaterialsAPR 6 Rules and RegulationsLaw Clerk Application InstructionsSAMPLE ApplicationPetition for Advanced StandingPrimary Tutor ApplicationEmployment Waiver Guidelines
Advanced Standing, Foreign CredentialsWhen you apply, you may petition for advanced standing in the program based on law school courses completed. The courses may be from either an approved or unapproved law school, but only law school courses may be considered. Undergraduate and paralegal courses, and employment experience will not be considered for advance standing credit. If you have completed undergraduate studies and/or law school in another country, you should provide an education credential evaluation report.EnrollmentThe Law Clerk Board makes determinations on enrollment and advanced standing in the program. Once you are enrolled, a fee payment is required each calendar year (currently $2,000/year). The Law Clerk Board and WSBA staff monitor participation in the program, but the law clerk and tutor study independently as they complete the course of study required by the regulations. A minimum of 32 hours per week performing the duties of a law clerk, including work and study, is required. The tutor is required to give at least three hours each week of personal supervision to the law clerk, which should include discussion of the law and cases and the critical analysis of the law clerk's written assignments.LimitationsYou do not earn a J.D. degree by completing the Law Clerk Program. The program is not accredited by the American Bar Association. It meets the requirements for admission to the practice of law in Washington state only and may not satisfy requirements for admission in other states; admission requirements are established on a state-by-state basis. For more information about other state’s requirements, contact the National Conference of Bar Examiners.
Please Note : All applicants are subject to a character and fitness review prior to being admitted to practice law in Washington.  Factors considered by Admissions staff and Bar Counsel when determining whether an applicant should be referred to the Character and Fitness Board are set forth in Washington Supreme Court Admission and Practice Rules (APR)  20-24.2(a).
Any discrepancy or conflict between the information provided here and the rules and regulations set by the Washington Supreme Court, or the Bylaws and policies of the Washington State Bar Association, is unintentional and will be resolved in favor of strict compliance with the rules, regulations, Bylaws and policies.
