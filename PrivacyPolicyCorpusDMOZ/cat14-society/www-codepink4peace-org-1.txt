Personal information is collected from supporters, donors, and volunteers for the overall purpose of meeting CODEPINK's mission to end war in Iraq, prevent new wars, and help sustain peace around the world. Prior to collecting personal information, the specific purpose and intended use is documented on all sign-up forms, petitions, and donation pages.
The personal information gathered by CODEPINK is kept in confidence. CODEPINK staff and volunteers are authorized to access personal information based only on their need to deal with the information for the reason(s) for which it was obtained. Safeguards are in place to ensure that the information is not disclosed or shared more widely than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was gathered.

CODEPINK sends frequent information and action alert notices through email. All emails sent include a link to CODEPINK's "unsubscribe" online form, which users may fill out should they wish to have their names removed from the email list.
