Scam emails
Scam emails & letters
We have been made aware that from time to time members of the public may be sent fraudulent emails and letters, purporting to come from Clyde & Co or from Barlow Lyde & Gilbert, a former practice with which Clyde & Co merged in 2011. Such emails and letters may include a copy of the logo of either firm and relay imaginative factual circumstances with a view to inducing the recipient to provide the sender with personal information or money or both. The emails and letters may suggest that the recipient is due a large sum of money (for example, inheritance, unclaimed bank funds, lottery wins or loans) and request the recipient to pay a smaller sum, sometimes termed a transaction fee or brokerage cost, in order to claim it. Such emails are known to the Metropolitan Police and NCA as "419 scams". Neither Clyde & Co nor Barlow Lyde & Gilbert has any involvement with these emails and letters. Recipients of such emails and letters should not respond to them.
Clyde & Co has a dedicated email inbox for reporting scams and other suspicious emails. If you receive an email which says it comes from Clyde & Co or Barlow Lyde & Gilbert and you have any doubts about it, please send it to scams@clydeco.com. Your query will be addressed by the Firm's Information Security and Risk teams who will advise you on next steps.
ALERT: We have recently been made aware of scams in which unsolicited emails are being circulated that purport to be from Clyde & Co personnel, including Austin Barham, Lee Bacon and Owen Carragher, all who are partners in this firm. These emails may set out a fictitious set of circumstances with the purpose of engaging the recipient and obtaining their personal details. If you receive an unsolicited email of this nature, you should carry out the checks outlined above. If the email is not genuine, we recommend that you report it to Action Fraud (0300 123 2040), or, if you are not based in the UK, to your local law enforcement agency.
