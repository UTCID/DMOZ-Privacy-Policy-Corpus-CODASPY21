Terms And Conditions
Terms of Use
Last Updated: November 17, 2017
Welcome to FirstGiving, an online platform powered by FrontStream Holdings, LLC and its affiliates, including FirstGiving, Inc. (together, “FrontStream,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Use (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of this website (the “Site”), which is designed to allow you to make donations to the Panorama Global Impact Fund, a donor-advised fund of Global Impact (the “Fund”), and to recommend that the Fund make contributions to qualified United States nonprofit organizations that have signed up for FrontStream’s online services (“NPO(s)”).
Please read these Terms before accessing or using the Site. By accessing or using the Site, you agree on behalf of yourself and any organization that you represent (together, “you”) that you have read and understand these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms and our Privacy Policy
in their entirety, you may not use the Site.
ARBITRATION NOTICE: These Terms contain a binding arbitration provision. You agree that, except for certain types of disputes described in the arbitration provision below, all disputes between you and FrontStream will be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration and you waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
FrontStream may update these Terms from time to time, and the latest version will be posted on the Site. By accessing the Site after changes are posted, you agree to those changes. Accordingly, you should periodically review these Terms as they appear from time to time on the Site. Material changes will be conspicuously posted on the Site.
1. PRIVACY POLICY
We may collect certain information from your use of the Site as set forth in our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by this reference. Your use of the Site constitutes your consent to the information collection, use, and sharing as set forth in our Privacy Policy.
2. YOUR ACCOUNT
While you may make donations using the Site without signing up for an online account, you will be required to set up an online account to use certain features of the Site. To create an account you will be required to submit certain information and will be required to establish a username and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any information you use in connection with the Site, including your username and password. Keep your password in a secure place and do not allow any unauthorized persons access to your password. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account, your password or other security breach, notify FrontStream immediately.
In connection with your access and use of the Site and that of any person authorized by you to access and use the Site, you are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, regulations
an-d policies of all relevant jurisdictions, including all applicable local rules regarding online conduct. You warrant that all information you provide to us in connection with your access to and use of the Site is true, accurate, and complete to the best of your knowledge and belief.
3. DONATIONS; FEES
FrontStream facilitates real-time tax receipting, and distribution of donated funds by, among other things, partnering with Global Impact, a U.S. tax-exempt organization that is able to accept donations through the Site and apply them (less applicable fees as described below) in furtherance of Global Impact’s charitable and other tax-exempt purposes to qualified U.S. nonprofit organizations.  Global Impact operates the Fund as a donor-advised fund in accordance with applicable U.S. tax laws.  Donations made using the Site are irrevocable gifts made to the Fund and are subject to the full authority, discretion, and control of Global Impact.  When you make a donation using the Site, you have the option to recommend that the Fund make a distribution to one or more NPOs in the amount of your donation, less applicable fees (a “Donor Recommendation”).  Global Impact will generally follow Donor
Recommendations, but has no obligation to do so.  Section 4 addresses certain instances in which Global Impact may not follow Donor Recommendations.  Global Impact, and not the recommended NPO, will issue you a contribution acknowledgment in accordance with applicable law, which acknowledgement may be provided through the Site.
Each time you make a donation using the Site, you represent and warrant to FrontStream and to Global Impact that each Donor Recommendation made by you in connection with such donation, if approved by Global Impact, (a) is not being used to satisfy any legally binding charitable pledge made by you; (b) does not provide you with more than an incidental benefit or any person related to you; and, (c) to your knowledge, will not be used for illegal purposes.
Donations made using the Site must be made by credit or debit card. Information about our collection and use of payment-related information is set forth in our Privacy Policy. If the credit or debit card information that you submit is incorrect or invalid, your donation will not be processed. We have no responsibility or liability if your credit or debit card is declined by your financial institution. Donations are processed by our PCI-compliant third-party payment processor. Refunds, if available, are solely the responsibility of Global Impact and are at Global Impact’s sole discretion.
All donations made via the Site will incur a fee of up to 7.5% of all such amounts (inclusive of any banking, credit card processing, wire transfer, and similar fees remitted to third-party payment processors or similar providers), which fee is deducted from the amounts disbursed by Global Impact to the NPOs in accordance with the Donor Recommendations (the “Fee”).
If a Donor Recommendation is approved, Global Impact will generally make payments to the recommended NPOs no more frequently than weekly. This payment schedule is subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of FrontStream and Global Impact.
4. NPOs; UNRESOLVED FUNDS
The NPOs listed on the Site may change at any time without notice to you. You understand and agree that there are some instances when your Donor Recommendation will not be approved by Global Impact or when Global Impact is unable to deliver a contribution to the NPO you have recommended (“Unresolved Funds”). These instances include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the recommended NPO has dissolved; (ii) the recommended NPO no longer qualifies as a tax-exempt public charity; (iii) the recommended NPO no longer qualifies under Global Impact’s internal vetting process with respect to anti-terror, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, OFAC “watch lists,” or other criteria as determined by Global Impact from time to time; or (iv) Global Impact is unable to make a contribution to the recommended NPO for any other reason (e.g., returned or uncashed checks). If Unresolved Funds cannot be delivered to the recommended NPO(s), Global Impact may redirect such funds to its general fund to be used for charitable purposes, or to any other qualified NPO.
5. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
The Site may provide links to or be linked to third-party websites not maintained or controlled by FrontStream. Such links are provided solely for your convenience. We do not review or endorse, and are not responsible for, any content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available from such websites.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM FRONTSTREAM OR IN ANY MANNER FROM THE SITE CREATES ANY WARRANTY.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Global Impact, FrontStream, its affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, contractors, representatives, licensors, information providers, and any other service or software providers (together, “FrontStream Parties”) from and against any and all third-party demands, claims, actions, proceedings, damages, liabilities, losses, fees, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and the costs of any investigation) arising out of or in connection with (A) your breach of these Terms; (B) any negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct by or on behalf of you or your employees or agents; or (D) your access to or use of the Site (including your donations) or your misuse of any material, data, or other information downloaded or otherwise obtained from the Site. FrontStream reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of
any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with FrontStream in the defense of such matter.
10. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FRONTSTREAM PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE, OR ANY OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE INPUT OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND OTHER INFORMATION INTO THE SITE), WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF A FRONTSTREAM PARTY HAS EXPRESS KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE LOSS OR DAMAGE.

GOVERNING LAW
These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia applicable to agreements made and wholly performed therein. Venue is exclusively in the state or federal courts, as applicable, with jurisdiction over Reston, Virginia, with respect to any dispute arising under these Terms unless otherwise determined by FrontStream in its sole discretion. The parties expressly agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
18.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS WAIVER; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
Please read the following paragraphs carefully because they require you to arbitrate disputes with FrontStream and limit the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of these Terms (together, “Disputes”) shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis as set forth in these Terms (this “Arbitration Agreement”). But, in the event of any actual, alleged, or threatened violation of confidentiality or violation of the FrontStream’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights, FrontStream may immediately resort to court proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in order to seek immediate injunctive relief without posting of a bond, proving damages, or meeting any similar requirement. Any institution of any action for injunctive relief will not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of either party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive relief to arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you; FrontStream; FrontStream’s
affiliates;
FrontStream’s and its affiliates’ respective directors, officers, employees, owners, agents, predecessors in interest, successors in interest, and assigns; authorized and unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Site; and any third-party beneficiaries.
Arbitration proceedings will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before an arbitrator chosen by agreement of the parties. If the parties fail to reach agreement on the arbitrator within 30 days after service of the demand for arbitration, the arbitrator will be chosen by the AAA. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding. Any final award or judgment may be filed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties will share equally in the costs assessed for the arbitration and each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Any arbitration proceeding may not be consolidated or joined with any other proceeding and will not proceed as a class action.
The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate disputes through a court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, and to participate in a class action or other proceeding involving multiple claimants, but they have instead
chosen to have all Disputes decided through individual arbitration.
The place of arbitration will be Reston, Virginia, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1–16, will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Any and all actions taken under this Arbitration Agreement, including all filings, orders, judgments, and awards made in any arbitration proceeding, are confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party. Arbitration proceedings must be initiated within one year after any Dispute arises; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred.
19.
INTERPRETATION; GENERAL
These Terms, including our Privacy Policy
and any terms or conditions incorporated by reference herein, are the entire agreement between you and FrontStream with respect to your access to and use of the Site. These Terms shall not be construed as creating or constituting a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties. We may assign our rights and delegate our duties under these Terms at any time to any party without notice to you. You may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any right or obligation set forth herein without FrontStream’s prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void and of no effect. These Terms are binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns. Any provisions of these Terms that are intended to survive termination
(including any provisions regarding indemnification, dispute resolution, or limitation of our liability) will continue in effect beyond any termination of these Terms or of your access to the Site. No failure of FrontStream to exercise or enforce any of its rights hereunder will act as a waiver of such rights. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by FrontStream. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be considered severable from the remaining provisions and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The headings in these Terms are for convenience only and do not affect the interpretation of these Terms. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein, all remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity or otherwise.
These Terms do not confer
any rights, remedies, or benefits upon any person other than you, except that our affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms.
