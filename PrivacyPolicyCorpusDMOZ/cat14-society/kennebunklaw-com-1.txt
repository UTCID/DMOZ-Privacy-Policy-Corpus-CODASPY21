Types of Nonpublic Personal Information We Collect
We may collect nonpublic personal information about you that is provided to us by you or obtained by us with your authorization.
Parties to Whom We Disclose Information
For current and former clients, we do not disclose any nonpublic personal information obtained in the course of our practice except as required or permitted by law, or by order of Court. Permitted disclosures include, for instance, providing information to our assistants and employees, and in limited situations, to unrelated third parties who need to know that information to assist us in providing services to you. In all such situations, we stress the confidential nature of information being shared.
Protecting the Confidentiality and Security of Current and Former Clients’ Information
We retain records relating to professional services that we provide so that we are better able to assist you with your professional needs and, in some cases, to comply with professional guidelines. In order to guard your nonpublic personal information, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with our professional standards.
Please call Lisa Hodsdon at (207) 985-6184 if you have any questions, because your privacy, our professional ethics, and the ability to provide you with quality legal services are very important to us.
