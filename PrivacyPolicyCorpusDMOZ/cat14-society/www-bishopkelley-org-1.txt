HomeAboutPrivacy Policy
Bishop Kelley High School respects your privacy and we do everything we can to ensure the confidentiality and security of any information you may provide to the school. We collect information when you fill out a registration, provide an alumni update, or make an online payment. We will not sell or trade your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, or any other information you may provide to us.
We do publicly thank our donors in our Giving Report, often by the level of support. This Registry of Donors is mailed and may also be posted online. Donors may also be recognized in our online newsletter, the Bishop Kelley Connection. Donors to specific events such as the Auction and Angelo Prassa Golf Tournament will be listed in materials related to those events. If you wish for any donation you make to Bishop Kelley to remain anonymous in our publications, please contact Margaret Jones in the Philanthropy Office at 918.609.7142.
From time to time, we publish celebrations relating to jobs and life events in our Alumni News. This information may be mailed or published online. Please contact alumni@bishopkelley.org if you wish to opt-out of including any of your own information in Alumni News.
If we change Bishop Kelley's Privacy Policy, those changes will be posted on this page.
If you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy, you may contact us at info@bishopkelley.org.
