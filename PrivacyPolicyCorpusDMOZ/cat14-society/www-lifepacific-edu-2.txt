Privacy Policy
Your privacy rights are important and Life Pacific University has implemented guidelines for its departments and offices requiring that information you submit will only be used for the purposes for which you have consented. We collect personally identifiable information that you choose to provide to us when you subscribe to sign up for e-mail newsletters, request a tour of the campus, request information about a degree, apply to become a student, register for events, or otherwise communicate with us. When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous.
Life Pacific University will never sell, rent, loan, trade or lease personal information to any third party. However, Life Pacific University may share lists of enrolled students with the Foursquare Church in limited instances.
We are committed to protecting personal information and respecting your privacy rights.
In some instances, we may be required to provide personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.
