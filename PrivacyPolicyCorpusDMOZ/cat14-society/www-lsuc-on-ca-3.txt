Rules and Protocol
Online Examination Rules and Protocol - added June 11, 2020
(Applicable to online licensing examinations)
Rules and Protocol - revised October 2019
Online Examination Rules and Protocol
(Applicable to online licensing examinations)
For the purposes of writing online licensing examinations other than the cancelled March 2020 Solicitor Licensing Examination, the below additional provisions are deemed included in the Rules and Protocol as the Online Examination Rules and Protocol section.
I. Definitions
Licensing Examination means Part 1 and Part 2 of the Licensing Examination administered or delivered by the Law Society or a Provider.
Note-taking Material means a single blank notepad, a piece of scrap paper, or the online note-taking feature provided by a Provider. For clarity, Note-taking Material includes all pages in the blank notepad, not merely the pieces of paper upon which a candidate writes.
Permitted Items means the items set out below as permitted items.
Proctor includes an individual retained or employed by a Provider to provide proctoring services.
Prohibited Actions includes the additional actions set out below that a candidate is prohibited from doing.
Proper Identification means a Law Society ID Card (including an expired card) or valid, government-issued photo identification that confirms the candidates full legal name as it is on file with the Law Society.
Provider means a direct or indirect service provider of the Law Society authorized by the Law Society to administer, proctor, or deliver a Licensing Examination.
Smartphone means a smartphone that meets the technical requirements provided or published by the Law Society or Provider for purposes of the Licensing Examination and that is disabled other than in respect of the camera.
Testing Area means the room where the candidate writes the Licensing Examination.
II. Online Administration
Candidates who wish to write an online Licensing Examination must review in its entirety and accept the privacy policy of MonitorEDU Inc., a Provider, available at https://monitoredu.com/privacy. References in the Rules and Protocol to scantron forms and Licensing Examination booklets are deemed amended to their equivalent, if any, applicable to an online Licensing Examination.
The Candidate schedules the start time for Part 1 with a Provider.
Candidates must follow the instructions and directions given to them by the Law Society, a Provider, a Proctor, or any agent or employee of any of them.
The total length of each Licensing Examination is 4 hours. Each Licensing Examination comprises two parts, each of which is 2 hours in length. Part 1 of the Licensing Examination must be written first. It is followed by a break of 30 minutes. After the 30-minute break, candidates must commence Part 2.
Candidates cannot access the questions in Part 2 of the Licensing Examination during Part 1. Candidates cannot access the questions in Part 1 of the Licensing Examination during Part 2 and cannot change their selected answers to questions in Part 1 of the Licensing Examination during Part 2.
Should a candidate leave the Testing Area during Part 1 of the Licensing Examination or during Part 2 of the Licensing Examination for unforeseen reasons, despite such departure from the Testing Area being a Prohibited Action, the time for the Licensing Examination continues to run. In addition, the candidate must, prior to leaving, and upon return to, the Testing Area, follow the Proctors directions and answer the Proctors questions. The potential consequences for engaging in a Prohibited Action apply.
Candidates must not remove anything from the Testing Area or bring anything into the Testing Area during the 30-minute break.
Candidates must verbally notify the Proctor prior to leaving the Testing Area during the 30-minute break and must follow the Proctors directions. Candidates must verbally notify the Proctor immediately upon returning to the Testing Area and must follow the Proctors directions.
Candidate are encouraged to return from their 30-minute break 5 minutes in advance.
For clarity (contrary to what is set out elsewhere in the Rules and Protocol designed for in-person licensing examinations), there is no morning/afternoon scheduling for Part 1 and Part 2: scheduling is only for Part 1.
Candidates are required to be ready to test on the scheduled day and at the start time provided by a Provider. Candidates must follow the check-in procedures provided by the Provider and Proctor. Candidates must show the Proctor Proper Identification before the Licensing Examination can begin. Candidates must abide by the Proctors request to show the Proctor the Testing Area before the Licensing Examination can begin and abide by the Proctors directions in respect thereof. Announcements will not be made in both English and French. Communications from the Provider and Proctor will be in the language of the Licensing Examination.
The Provider will send a link to the Licensing Examination to the candidate through the candidates email address prior to the start of the candidates Licensing Examination. Once the check-in procedures have been completed and the Proctor has verified the candidates Testing Area and identity, the Proctor will provide the candidate with an access code in order to access the Licensing Examination. The candidate will not be provided with a wristband and is not required to meet any procedures associated with wristbands. Prior to beginning the Licensing Examination, the candidate will be required to agree to the Candidate Agreement.
A candidate who begins Part 1 of a Licensing Examination is deemed to have attempted that Licensing Examination. The Licensing Examination will be marked and an official result given, whether or not the candidate completes the Licensing Examination or attempts Part 2.
Candidates who seek to begin to write Part 1 of the Licensing Examination more than 30 minutes after the scheduled start time will not be permitted to start and will receive an official result of Unexcused Absence for the Licensing Examination (both Part 1 and Part 2). Candidates must begin to write Part 2 of the Licensing Examination immediately upon the end of the 30-minute break. The time allotted for Part 2 will commence upon the end of the 30-minute break (subject to any additional time deemed necessary by the Proctor to complete scanning and security activities). Candidates who seek to begin to write Part 2 of the Licensing Examination more than 10 minutes after the end of the 30-minute break may not be permitted to begin Part 2. If that occurs, their official result nonetheless will be calculated based on the Licensing Examination as a whole.
Time for the completion of each part of the Licensing Examination is kept on the computer, not by a Proctor. No additional time is allotted for feedback and candidates will not receive an Examination Feedback Form. Candidates may be provided with another means to provide feedback. There is no Licensing Examination Day Schedule.
Candidates must ensure that the conditions set out below are met. A candidates failure to meet these conditions prior to the Licensing Examination starting may result in the Licensing Examination not being held and the candidate receiving an official result of Unexcused Absence for that Licensing Examination. A candidates failure to meet these conditions during the Licensing Examination may result in the Licensing Examination being terminated and the candidate receiving such result as the Law Society deems appropriate. A candidates failure to meet these conditions that may impact the security or integrity of the Licensing Examination may result in the matter being referred to the appropriate parties at the Law Society for disciplinary action, as indicated in the Candidate Agreement (and as outlined in section 8 of the main body of the Rules and Protocol).
Conditions
The candidate has watched the video on proctoring made known to the candidate by the Law Society or a Provider.
The candidate has accessed sample online licensing examination questions in a Providers software (information in respect of which was posted by the Law Society or a Provider or sent to the candidate) and has become sufficiently familiar with the functionality and features of the software that will be used for the Licensing Examination that the candidate, acting reasonably, expects not to experience concerns with using the software during the Licensing Examination.
The candidate has reviewed the Candidate Agreement.
The candidate has available (a) a laptop computer, or a desktop computer with a monitor, and a webcam and (b) a Smartphone. Both (a) and (b) meet the technical requirements provided to the candidate (by email, through online posting, or by other means) by the Law Society or a Provider.

III. Prior to Starting and During the Licensing Examination
Prior to starting the Licensing Examination and during the Licensing Examination, candidates must comply with any Proctor request to
remove items that are not Permitted Items;
show that their pockets are empty;
demonstrate that an object on, about, or being used by the candidate is not being used to facilitate a Prohibited Action; or
demonstrate that a concern noticed by the Proctor within the Testing Area is not a security concern.
During the Licensing Examination, candidates are not permitted to do any Prohibited Actions. A candidate's failure to meet these conditions during the Licensing Examination may result in the Licensing Examination being terminated and the candidate receiving such result as the Law Society deems appropriate. A candidate's failure to meet these conditions that may impact the security or integrity of the Licensing Examination may result in the matter being referred to the appropriate parties at the Law Society for disciplinary action, as indicated in the Candidate Agreement (and as outlined in section 8 of the main body of the Rules and Protocol).
The Prohibited Actions are the following:
Wearing a hat, hood, coat, or bulky clothing (except where same constitutes Religious Attire).
Wearing headphones, earplugs, or similar items.
Refusing to cooperate with the Proctor or to satisfy requests made by the Proctor, including requests to move the candidates computer, Smartphone, or other object, whether same is inside or outside of the Testing Area.
Wearing a watch.
Having access to, accessing, or using non-required electronics.
Having access to, accessing, or using a communication device or any type of recording device, other than those listed as required for the Licensing Examination.
Having anything in the candidates pockets.
Making notes on or in any way marking up (whether by folding corners, highlighting, or otherwise) anything other than the permitted Note-taking Material.
Having anything on the desk or within reach, other than Permitted Items.
Leaving the Testing Area during Part 1 or during Part 2 of the Licensing Examination.
Failing to commence Part 2 of the Licensing Examination within 10 minutes after the end of the 30-minute break.
During and after the Licensing Examination, candidates are prohibited from communicating with any person about the Examination Content. During the Licensing Examination, candidates are prohibited from communicating with any person about anything that may be related to the Examination Content (e.g., relevant law). References to candidate obligations (including prohibitions) during the Licensing Examination include during any breaks, whether such breaks are included or excluded in the calculation of the time allotted for the Licensing Examination.
During the Licensing Examination, the Proctor will be monitoring the candidate. Should the Proctor observe behaviour or circumstances that the Proctor determines may entail a risk to the security or integrity of the Licensing Examination, the Proctor will contact the candidate. Depending on what the Proctor observes, the Proctor may take any of the following actions, alone or in combination, or such other action as may be reasonable:
make further inquiries;
request that the behaviour cease;
request that the circumstances be changed;
begin recording the candidate;
notify the Law Society or a Provider, or both; or
stop the Licensing Examination.
If the Law Society or a Provider is notified, they may take such action as is reasonable.
The following is a non-exclusive list of behaviour and circumstances that the Proctor may determine entails a risk to the security or integrity of the Licensing Examination:
the candidate looking away from the Licensing Examination and study materials in an unusual manner or pattern;
the candidate speaking aloud, including reading from the Licensing Examination;
obscuring of a camera;
obscuring of the candidate;
obscuring of the Testing Area; and
other areas of the Testing Area being accessed by the candidate or another person.
IV. The End of the Licensing Examination
When there are 30 minutes left in the time allotted to complete each of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Licensing Examination, a pop-up window will appear on the candidates screen and the candidate must close this window to continue writing the Licensing Examination. The time allotted for the Licensing Examination stops while the pop-up window is on the screen. No lead Proctor will make announcements to stop writing or to leave the Testing Area. At the end of each part of the Licensing Examination, the Licensing Examination will automatically close and candidate answers will automatically be submitted.
Immediately after completing each part of the Licensing Examination, rather than all candidate print materials being shredded by the Law Society, the candidate is required to shred, destroy, or rip into miniscule bits any paper Note-taking Material (including pieces of paper upon which no notes were made if so requested by the Proctor). Such shredding, destruction, or ripping shall be done both completely and to the satisfaction of the Proctor. Even if the Proctor does not request same, the candidate must complete the shredding, destruction, or ripping. All shredded, destroyed, and ripped Note-taking Material must also be immediately discarded in such a manner that it cannot be retrieved. Candidates are prohibited from attempting to re-construct, copy, retain, or otherwise make use of the Note-taking Material.
Once a candidate finishes each part of a Licensing Examination, the candidate must follow the instructions on the computer screen and from the Proctor. There is no Exit Pass.
V. Priority
Where the above provisions are contrary to what is set out below in the Rules and Protocol such that compliance with both is impossible, the above provisions apply. Where the provisions in the Rules and Protocol are contrary to what is set out in the Candidate Agreement such that compliance with both is impossible, the provisions in the Candidate Agreement apply.
Where the above provisions appear inconsistent with other information or instructions published or provided by the Law Society relating to online licensing examinations, the above provisions apply unless such information or instructions specifically state that they take priority over contrary provisions in the Rules and Protocol.

3. Confidentiality and Security
The Law Society maintains strict confidentiality and security of the Examination Materials.
Stringent protocols and security measures have been put in place to ensure that the integrity of the Licensing Examinations and the Examination Materials is always maintained. These measures are designed to eliminate any unfair advantage among candidates and avoid the high cost of replacing the Examination Materials in the event of a security breach. These protocols have been implemented at all phases of development of the Examination Materials, including development, review, translation, printing, transportation and disposal of the Examination Materials.
All Examination Materials are the exclusive property of the Law Society and are protected by copyright.
In order to preserve the confidentiality and security of the Licensing Examinations, candidates are strictly prohibited at all times from disclosing to any person or organization, reproducing (through memorization or by any other means) or publishing any Examination Content (such as any items from a Licensing Examination or any multiple-choice answers to them) or any of the Examination Materials.
Candidates are prohibited from disclosing any accommodation granted to them by the Law Society, or information related thereto, to any person other than
a medical professional, such disclosure being permitted
(i)    only for the strict purpose of the medical professional advising or evaluating the candidate with respect to the writing of the Licensing Examinations and
(ii)    only to the extent necessary to meet such purpose; and
the candidates family, friend, or service provider, such disclosure being permitted
(i)    only for the strict purpose of receiving support with the implementation of an accommodation (e.g., to drop off or pick up the candidate from the licensing examination site or a medical appointment) and
(ii)    only to the extent necessary to meet such purpose.
Please note that candidates are not prohibited from discussing their feelings or mental health concerns (e.g., anxiety) arising from the licensing examinations.
A candidate who opens the sealed Examination Materials package is deemed to have attempted his or her Licensing Examination. The candidates answer sheet will be marked and an official result given, whether or not the candidate completes the Licensing Examination.
Candidates must bring all print study materials, notes and textbooks into the Testing Area prior to the start of Part 1 of the Examination Sitting. Candidates are not permitted to bring any additional materials into the Testing Area after the Licensing Examination has begun (including for Part 2 of the Examination Sitting). Please refer to the list of Permitted Items in Section 6 below for further details.
4. Format and Timing of the Examination Sitting
A. Examination Format:
Licensing Examinations may be written in either French or English at any Examination Site. At each Examination Site, announcements will be made in both languages unless, as of ten business days prior to the Examination Sitting, there are no candidates at that Examination Site who have registered to write the Licensing Examination in one of the languages or who have indicated that their language of correspondence is one of the languages.
The total length of each Licensing Examination is 7 hours (420 minutes). Each Examination Sitting is comprised of two parts, each of which is 3.5 hours (210 minutes) in length. Part 1 takes place during the morning, and Part 2 takes place during the afternoon. At the end of each Part an additional 5 minutes is allotted for completion of an Examination Feedback Form. A lunch break is provided between the two Parts of the Examination.
B. Admission to the Testing Area:
Candidates must be seated in their assigned seats within the Testing Area by no later than 30 minutes prior to the start of Part 1 of the Examination Sitting. Upon entering the Testing Area, candidates must proceed directly to their assigned seat. Candidates should confirm that they have arrived at their assigned seat by checking that the seat number identified on their desk matches the seat number listed on their registration wristband.
Candidates who fail to arrive at the Examination Site by the required time are permitted to enter the Testing Area for up to one hour after the start of Part 1 of the Examination Sitting. Such candidates will not be provided with any extra writing time.
Candidates who arrive at the Examination Site more than one hour after the start of Part 1 of the Examination Sitting will not be permitted entry to the Testing Area. Such candidates will be deemed to have failed to attend the Examination Sitting, and where such candidates fail to provide valid notification to the Law Society they will receive an official result of Unexcused Absence for that Licensing Examination.
Candidates who arrive late for the start of Part 2 of the Examination Sitting will not be provided with any extra writing time.
C. Examination Timing:
Time is kept by a digital timer and a clock visible to all candidates. The Lead Proctor will start and stop the timer and instruct candidates when to start and stop writing the Licensing Examination.
Candidates are prohibited from writing any answers to items in the Examination Materials prior to an announcement to start writing the Licensing Examination. Candidates are also prohibited from writing, erasing or otherwise altering any answers to items in the Examination Materials after an announcement to stop writing the Licensing Examination.
No verbal time cues will be provided during the writing of the Examination. Candidates may make use of the projected digital timer and clock to track their progress through the examination questions. In addition, the Licensing Examination Day Schedule below is included on the Quick Reference - Licensing Examination Rules and Protocols sheet at each seat.  The Schedule lists details of the events of the day, time for each and for when candidates are permitted to enter and exit the Testing Area, and to take restroom breaks.
License Examination Day Schedule (PDF)
D. Procedures for the Conclusion of either Part of the Examination Sitting:
When the Lead Proctor makes the announcement for all candidates to stop writing at the end of the allotted time for either part of the Examination Sitting, all candidates must immediately stop writing, put down pencils and erasers, and close their Licensing Examination booklet. At the conclusion of either part of the Examination Sitting, all candidates must remain seated until the Examination Materials have been collected. Candidates are not permitted to take restroom breaks during this time, because Proctors will be collecting materials and unavailable to assist candidates.
Candidates will be provided with an Examination Feedback Form to report to the Law Society any perceived issues with the administration of the Examination Sitting or with the Examination Materials. When Proctors have collected the scantron answer sheets, 5 minutes will be provided for candidates to complete the Examination Feedback Form. Proctors will then collect the examination booklets and, at the conclusion of the examination sitting, the Examination Feedback Forms. Candidates are not permitted to remove their Examination Feedback Forms from the Testing Area. The Examination Feedback Form will be reviewed by the Law Society.
The Lead Proctor will provide instructions for dismissal from the Testing Area. Candidates should be aware that the dismissal process at the end of Part 1 and at the conclusion of the examination sitting involves a security screening and for large groups can take up to 20 minutes.
The Testing Area is secured and closed during the break between Part 1 and Part 2 of the Examination Sitting. Candidates are not permitted to remain in the Testing Area during that break.
When leaving the Testing Area after either part of the Examination Sitting, candidates may remove from the Testing Area their Permitted Items contained in their Storage Bag, their sweater, or other item of clothing, and any clear plastic beverage containers. All pieces of paper (including tissues, wrapping and receipts), except for candidates coat check tickets, will be removed from candidates Storage Bags upon exiting the Testing Area.
All other materials, including the Examination Materials and any print materials the candidate brings into the Testing Area, must remain in the Testing Area at the candidates desk, both during the break between Part 1 and Part 2 and at the conclusion of Part 2 of the Examination Sitting. After the Examination Sitting, all candidate print materials will be shredded.
E. Candidates who Finish Early:
A candidate who determines that he/she has completed either part of the Examination Sitting prior to the allotted time must raise his/her hand and remain seated until a Proctor has attended their desk. The Proctor will review the candidates Licensing Examination booklet and answer sheet, collect all Examination Materials, and provide the candidate with an Exit Pass. Candidates are not permitted to leave the Testing Area without an Exit Pass.
Candidates are not permitted to leave the Testing Area until one hour has elapsed after the start of a part of the Examination Sitting. Candidates who exit the Testing Area prior to the allotted time for either part of the Examination Sitting will not be permitted re-entry during that part. Candidates who determine that they have completed either part of the Examination Sitting during the final 15 minutes of the allotted time are not permitted to leave the Testing Area early and must remain seated in the Testing Area until the announcement is made for all candidates to stop writing.
Candidates who exit the Testing Area prior to the allotted time must do so quietly, out of courtesy to those candidates still writing. Upon exiting the Testing Area after either part of the Examination Sitting, candidates may not gather with other candidates in any area adjacent to the Testing Area during the Examination Sitting.
F. Disruptions or Interruptions:
In the event of a disruption during the Examination Sitting (for example, a fire alarm), instructions will be projected on a screen at the front of the Testing Area room or provided orally. The Law Society may stop the timer to make any necessary announcements. Minor interruptions will not result in the timer being stopped.
Candidates must ensure they are available until 7:00 PM on the day of each Examination Sitting for which they are registered, in order to accommodate any unforeseen circumstances resulting from disruptions or emergencies that may necessitate the time specified for the Examination Sitting to be extended or altered.
5. Registration and Security Screening at the Examination Site
Candidates who have registered for an Examination Sitting must arrive at the Examination Site by the time established by the Law Society. Candidates who fail to attend an Examination Sitting for which they have registered and fail to provide valid notification to the Law Society will receive an official result of Unexcused Absence for that Licensing Examination.
Upon arrival at an Examination Site, candidates must first report to the Registration Desk to sign the registration sheet in the presence of a Proctor in order to be eligible to write the Licensing Examination. Candidates must present their Law Society ID Card at that time, for confirmation of their identity. Candidates without their Law Society ID Card will not be admitted into the Testing Area.
The Law Society ID Card follows protocols established by Citizenship and Immigration Canada with respect to photograph specifications. In particular, hats and head coverings must not be worn, unless they are worn daily for religious beliefs or medical reasons. In every case, a candidates full face must be clearly visible and any head covering must not cast any shadows on the candidates face. At the time of registration, a candidate may be asked to remove any Religious Attire, or part thereof, if necessary to establish the candidates identity. If this is required, the Law Society will take measures to respect the dignity of the candidate.
After a candidate has signed the registration sheet, a Proctor at the Registration Desk will issue the candidate a registration wristband, which indicates the candidates pre-assigned seat number. The Proctor will immediately secure the registration wristband to the candidates right wrist. The candidate must wear the registration wristband for the duration of the Examination Sitting. Candidates are not permitted to enter the Testing Area without their registration wristband.
Following registration, candidates must proceed to the designated security screening area and submit to an inspection of all personal items conducted by Proctors and Law Society staff. Candidates will be required to proceed through the security screening area a total of four times during each Examination Sitting: upon entry to and exit from the Testing Area for both Part 1 and Part 2.
Candidates are prohibited from falsifying or misrepresenting information required for admission to the Testing Area. Candidates are also prohibited from impersonating other candidates, and from allowing an impersonator, to write any part of a Licensing Examination on their behalf.
Friends, relatives or children who accompany a candidate to the Examination Site will not be permitted access to the registration area, security screening area or Testing Area. Friends, relatives or children may not wait in the Testing Area nor may they contact a candidate who is writing the Licensing Examination. Persons who wish to contact a candidate on an urgent basis should contact the Law Society, who will relay a message to a candidate.
6. Personal Belongings
To ensure the security of the Testing Area, Prohibited Items (as defined below) will not be permitted inside the Testing Area. Outerwear items, including coats, ponchos, hats, other headgear, and gloves, must be stored with the complimentary coat check service provided by the venue.
The Law Society is not responsible for lost, stolen, broken or misplaced property and strongly recommends that candidates do not bring personal, valuable or non-examination items with them to the Examination Site.
A. Permitted Items:
Inside the Testing Area, the Law Society provides each candidate with the Examination Materials (a booklet with examination questions and a scantron answer sheet), two pencils, a highlighter, a calculator, and an eraser. Only the pencils provided may be used to fill in the answer sheet.
Candidates may bring only items designated as Permitted Items into the Testing Area. Except as stated in item (1) below, candidates may remove Permitted Items when exiting the Testing Area.
The Law Society has designated the following items as Permitted Items:
1. Print materials prepared for the purpose of assisting the candidate in writing the examination, including Law Society Examination Study Materials, other study materials, notes, and textbooks, which may be bound or loose. Binders are not recommended for use in the Testing Area; loose binder rings and cerlox bindings are preferable.
Commentary: These materials may be carried into the Testing Area in a disposable bag, but not in any form of luggage listed as a Prohibited Item. Bags must be left in the Testing Area. The Law Society respects the environmental concerns of its Licensing Candidates and wishes you to be aware that binders in large quantities cannot be screened or repurposed by The Law Society, and must be destroyed. Candidates may exit the Testing Area with loose binder rings (but not with binders) at the completion of the examination. All print materials and paper must be left in the Testing Area and will not be returned to candidates under any circumstances.
2. Non-alcoholic beverages in clear plastic containers.
Commentary: There is no limit on the number of beverage containers a candidate may bring into the Testing Area. Containers which have already been opened are permitted only if they are re-sealable. Candidates should be sure to bring sufficient beverages for the day.
3. A single sweater, blazer, cardigan, or hooded sweatshirt ("hoodie"). When inside the Testing Area, candidates wearing a hoodie are prohibited from wearing its hood up over their head, and must keep the hood visible at all times. Scarves and wrap-style shawls may also be worn around the neck and shoulders in the Testing Area. When not being worn, items above must be stored beneath the candidates seat.

a) Law Society ID Card.
b) Food in its original wrapping/container, or re-covered in a clear wrapping (e.g., Saran Wrap).
Commentary: Out of consideration for their colleagues, candidates are asked not to consume foods in the Testing Area that are noisy, distracting, or have a strong scent (e.g., uncut apples, raw carrots, unpeeled oranges, fish). Those kinds of foods can be consumed freely during the lunch break outside of the Testing Area, but should be left inside the candidates Storage Bag while inside the Testing Area.
c) Plastic cutlery.
d) Hygiene products.
Commentary: Some candidates are mildly to severely allergic to certain scents and odours. Candidates are asked to use any perfume, aftershave, cologne, hair spray, or lotions only in moderation, and are asked not to re-apply any of these scent- and odour-producing products at the Examination Site.
e) Medication(s) in clear containers or packaging (but not in non-clear pillboxes, organizers or cases).
f) Tissues (loose or in a clear wrapping).
Commentary: As with all paper, tissues may not be removed from the Testing Area once they have been brought in.
g) Wallets
Commentary: Remove all paper from your wallet before entering the Testing Area (e.g., proof of insurance form, paper forms of identification, lottery tickets, travel documents, photos). As with all paper, if such papers are inadvertently left in a wallet, they may not be removed from the Testing Area once they have been brought in.

Commentary: In compliance with the security screening procedures and protocols, to ensure the integrity of the Licensing Examinations and Examination Materials, a candidate may be asked to remove Religious Attire, or part thereof, if necessary to establish the candidates identity. If this is required, the Law Society will take measures to respect the dignity of the candidate.
7. Conduct during the Examination Sitting
All candidates must comply with the Law Societys Licensing Process Policies. Pursuant to these Policies, candidates shall not engage in any form of dishonesty, fraud, cheating, misrepresentation or other misconduct related to the Licensing Examinations, including, but not limited to:

Proctors and Law Society staff will monitor and observe all candidates during the Examination Sitting. Candidates must comply with all requests or instructions made by a Proctor or Law Society staff member during an Examination Sitting, including, but not limited to, a request to leave the Testing Area. Candidates are prohibited from being physically or verbally abusive towards any Proctor, Law Society staff member, or other candidate at any time during an Examination Sitting. Candidates may not create any continuing distraction by sound, movement or odour which could disrupt the concentration of other candidates in the Testing Area.
Inside the Testing Area, candidates must display their Law Society ID Card at the top right corner of their desk (or whichever corner is closest to the aisle) at all times during the Examination Sitting.
Candidates must keep their Storage Bag directly under their chair at all times during the writing of the Licensing Examination. Candidates may not access their Storage Bag during the writing of the Licensing Examination except under the direct supervision of a Proctor. Candidates who require an item from their Storage Bag during the writing of the Licensing Examination must raise their hand and a Proctor will assist them.
Candidates may not leave their seat during the Examination Sitting unless escorted by a Proctor. Candidates who require a restroom break should raise their hand and a Proctor will collect their Examination Materials and escort them to and from the restroom. Restroom breaks are not allowed during announcements which occur before and after each part of the Examination Sitting.
Candidates who remove any articles of clothing (such as a sweater, scarf, etc.) during the Examination Sitting must place the clothing directly under their chair.
A candidate who behaves inappropriately may be instructed to leave the Testing Area and their Licensing Examination may receive an official result of Fail.
In the event of a disruption or an emergency of any kind, when the Law Society has stopped the clock, candidates must immediately stop writing, put down pencils and erasers, and close their Licensing Examination booklet. Proctors will collect all examination materials and candidates should remain seated and wait for instructions from Law Society staff.
