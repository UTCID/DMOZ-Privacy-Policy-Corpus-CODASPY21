This Privacy Statement is effective as of the date written above and is designed to meet the following principles and practices:
We fully disclose what information is collected on our sites and how we use that information;
Campaign organizers, participants and supporters who participate in our online campaign programs may choose whether they want to continue to receive communications from us;
We provide our registered campaign organizers with access to their account information and the ability to modify that information; and
We are dedicated to creating a secure environment for user information and use an advanced network server security system to safeguard user information.
In the more detailed description of our privacy practices below, when we use the term "you," we are referring to registered campaign organizers, participants, supporters and general users of our web sites who order campaign products or information from our web sites. When we use the term "personal information," we are referring to user's first and last name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Fundraising.com does not collect social security numbers.
Violating our privacy policy is cause for termination of your campaign. In addition, Fundraising.com reserves the right to cooperate with municipal, state and federal officials in any law-enforcement investigation requiring either personal information or reports about lawful or unlawful user activities on this site.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. Registration Information In order to use our services, and/or to receive a free information kit, campaign organizers must complete an online registration form or call our toll-free number at 1-800-561-8388. When registering online or by phone, campaign organizers need to supply contact information, relevant affiliation(s), and details related to their fundraising campaign, such as their first name, last name, group name, email address, phone number and physical mailing address. We collect this information from fundraising campaign organizers to assess the organizer's fundraising needs and to respond to them with information relevant to their request.
We use their first and last names to personalize usersâ€™ fundraising.com access. We use email address to contact users, if necessary. We use the campaign organizers mailing address to send profit checks and their phone number to contact them when requested. Some information, that is not of a personal nature, such as which browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Netscape, etc.), the operating system you are using (Windows, Mac Os, etc.) and your domain name (IP address) or Internet provider, may be collected. This information will be used in statistical analyses of site usage. It helps us improve and personalize our service and content to better meet your needs and make the site more enjoyable, efficient and secure to use.
Order Information
To purchase or order sample campaign products through any of our sites, you will need to provide order information (which may include credit card information). If you are purchasing campaign products from us, once your credit card has been approved by our third-party transactional company for the amount equaling the total of the supporter's desired purchases, the third-party supplier(s) will receive all relevant purchase details (item description, quantity, etc.) needed to fulfill the order. All personal information collected during the ordering process is used for order processing, billing and shipping.
Information Sharing
We will not rent or share your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their promotional purposes. As detailed above, Fundraising.com does not give your personal information to third parties not associated with our campaign products or services. Our third-party suppliers use a variety of external delivery companies to ship orders, and a third-party firm processes the campaign supporters' credit cards for goods purchased. These companies, by contractual agreement with us, are not permitted to retain, store or use personally identifiable customer information except for order processing and fulfillment.
Data Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at online@fundraising.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Fundraising.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. If you receive an email inviting you to visit our site, this email was initiated by the Fundraising campaign manager and not by Fundraising.com. Fundraising supporters may also receive reminder emails about the fundraising campaign.
