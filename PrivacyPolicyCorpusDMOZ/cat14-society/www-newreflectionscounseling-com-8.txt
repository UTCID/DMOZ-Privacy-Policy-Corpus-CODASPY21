Health Policy
Our offices will remain open for in-person counseling unless the State of Ohio rules that businesses of even a few people gathering together are a threat to public safety. Given everyone’s level of stress and anxiety, counseling is needed more than ever.
Our standard policy (in existence before the virus) is if you are sick you can cancel your appointment at any time and you won’t be charged. During elevated levels of health risk, we won’t be greeting anyone by shaking hands and will remain the recommended 6 feet apart. You can wear a mask, but we aren’t requiring this during your counseling session.
For your protection and the protection of other clients like you, including those who may be allergic or have asthma, please do not use tobacco products. Smoking is not allowed in the building or outside near the entrances to the building. Please do not smoke immediately before attending your appointment.
We appreciate your cooperation with our health policy. Thank you so much!
