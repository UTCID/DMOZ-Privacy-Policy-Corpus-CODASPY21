School Policies and Relevant Procedures
All Schools are required to have a clear set of policies and procedures. Some are required in order to comply with Government legislation, such as Health and Safety. All our policies and procedures are like a firm foundation, on which to build our school. The comprehensive set of guidelines enables children, staff, governors and parents to work together to benefit the learning potential of each child.
