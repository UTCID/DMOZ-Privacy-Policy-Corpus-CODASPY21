Every day I realize how blessed and privileged I am to be a Glenmary Home Missioner. I get to enter sacred spaces with my encounters and interactions with the people of God.
- Brother Jason Muhlenkamp, Glenmarian
Taking a trip to the missions taught me that I can’t take my faith and the ability to practice that faith for granted.
- Rita M., Glenmary supporter.
The amazing thing about being a Glenmary volunteer is that the Glenmary spirit of ecumenism and charity is everywhere.
- Alyson M., mountain manager at Toppa Joppa, Grainger County, Tenn.
Many times, the faith and dedication of the people of the missions humbled me and challenged me to rededicate myself to our missionary work.
- Father Aaron Wessman, Glenmarian
