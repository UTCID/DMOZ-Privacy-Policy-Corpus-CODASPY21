“A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.”
— Steve Jobs - Wired, 1996
WHAT CLIENTS SAY ABOUT ME
“We hired Gary because he knows his way around high-tech and Internet law (and related topics like intellectual copyright) — but apart from being an expert, he is also an ideal adviser to us in other ways. He’s got a deep understanding of how small businesses work, and as such he makes sure we spend our dollars wisely. Not only that, but he’s a genuine pleasure to do business with — friendly, no-nonsense, and able to translate legal concepts into accessible language.”
— Web Designers
“Gary is a great person to work with. He is practical, to-the-point and will always make time for his client when it is crunch time. I highly recommend him.”
— Software Developers
