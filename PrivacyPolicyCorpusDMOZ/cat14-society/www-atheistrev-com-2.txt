Atheist Revolution is a personal weblog. It is not intended to be a source of objective journalism, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, a set of "holy" documents, or anything of the sort. The views expressed here are mine and not those of my employer or anyone else.
Like most open-minded people who make an effort to remain rooted in reality, my thoughts and opinions inevitably change over time. Individual blog posts provide a glimpse into what I may have been thinking at one point in time; they do not necessarily reflect my current views. In fact, many of the old posts you will find here reflect positions I no longer hold.

I will not be liable for any errors or omissions in this information, the availability of this information, or for any losses, injuries, or damages resulting from the access, display, or use of this information.
