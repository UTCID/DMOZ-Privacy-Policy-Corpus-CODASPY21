Home/Need Help or Advice?/Parents/FAQs on Domestic Violence for fathers
Our interactive Advice ServiceParents discussion boardFAQsFathers FAQSFAQs on Domestic Violence for fathersDomestic Violence advice for mothersYoung Parents' Advice website
This section of the website is for fathers (or men in a parenting role) who are involved with children’s services because their children are (or may be) harmed by experiencing and/or witnessing domestic violence.
Domestic violence can involve physical or sexual abuse, rape, emotional abuse and isolation, coercion, threats, intimidation, economic abuse, financial control, forced marriage and honour-based violence. It can happen online as well as offline.
Research shows that witnessing domestic violence can be very harmful for children. The damage it causes is specifically included in the legal definition of significant harm to a child.
In this section of the website you will find FAQs on:
Early help
Male victims of domestic violence
Child in need
Child protection
Pregnancy
Contact arrangements for children
Section 20 accommodation
Care proceedings
Rights to information
There are more FAQs for fathers in the Parents section of our website which we hope will help you to work with children’s services if they are involved with your children.Young fathers (aged up to 30) may be interested in our Young Parents Project and our new mobile-friendly Young Parents Advice website.
Note on the language we have used: We refer to survivors of domestic violence as "the mother" or "she". We refer to the abuser or perpetrator as "the father" or "he". We have chosen to use this language because it reflects the situation in the majority of cases. However, we recognise that men can also be survivors of domestic violence and that domestic violence can occur in same sex couples.
The information we have provided generally applies to England and Wales. However, there are some differences in the law between England and Wales. If you live in Wales you could get local advice from a solicitor or Citizen's Advice Bureau.
Thank you to Noel Buxton Trust for funding Family Rights Group to develop these advice resources.
