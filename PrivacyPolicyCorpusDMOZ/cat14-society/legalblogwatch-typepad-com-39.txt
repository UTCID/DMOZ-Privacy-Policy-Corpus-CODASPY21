What year will the HLR stop publishing?
Volokh Conspirator Orin Kerr, in his links to SCOTUSblog's new reports with voting stats from the recently completed Supreme Court term, tucks an interesting aside into his commentary. Referring to the reports, he writes:"(This used to be a job for the Harvard Law Review's annual Supreme Court issue, but thanks to G&H's summer associates and the blogosphere more generally, such stats will be old news by the time the issue comes out in the coming winter.)"Exactly. Click here for Kerr's review of notable findings from the reports and here for Kerr's post on new elite law review editorial policies that call for shorter articles.

3Ls: Who will train you?
J. Craig Williams is caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place: A seasoned attorney who only hires colleagues with 10 or more years of experience for his own firm, Williams is now watching the newly minted lawyer in the family, son Michel Ayer, job hunt.
"So how do we balance the desire not to pay for "training" lawyers with the desire to hire (and for that matter use in law firms) only trained lawyers?" asks Williams.
So, 3Ls, what do you think the profession owes itself -- and you? Comment here.

MacEwen runs the numbers on Am Law 100
Yup, the rich really are getting richer, says Bruce MacEwen.
The blogger of Adam Smith, Esq., spent yesterday running the numbers in year-over-year comparisons of revenue growth for The American Lawyer magazine's annual report.
Here's what he found:
"So what do we see?  I would argue:  Striking visual evidence that the hypothesis is correct. For each of the three series, the rate of increase in revenue is higher for larger firms than for smaller ..." I performed one other test.  Using Excel's "forecast" function, which extrapolates a series out to a future data point, I asked what revenue growth would look like for AmLaw firm #200, and these are the almost shocking results:Based on an extrapolation of the 2004 vs. 2003 series, firm #200 would have revenue "growth" of -7.18%.  (Yes, that's a minus sign.)
Equally damning, based on an extrapolation of the two-year series (2004 vs. 2002), that same firm would scarcely enjoy any net revenue growth at all for the two years:  Specifically, a charitable-to-call-it-anemic 0.12%.
"I anticipate copious emails from the incredulous, the triumphant, and the Ph.D. statisticians."For an explanation of this graphic and MacEwen's methodology, click here.

Supremes on globe: Flat as they want it to be
Todd Zywicki, whose no-baloney blogging and congressional testimony about bankruptcy law impressed me even when I disagreed with him, has written a terrific post about the Supremes' treatment of international law.
In one blistering paragraph, Zywicki writes, "Leaving aside all of the intellectual arguments for whether the Court should or should not rely on international law for constitutional guidance, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Court's periodic reliance on world legal opinion is purely strategic rather than sincere, perhaps to dress up the Court's personal predilections in the guise of legal authority." More.
Amen. You should really read the whole, articulate thing -- and the 20 comments he has elicited. My 2 cents: Zywicki's right -- the Court is treating the globe as flat when it suits them, and round when it doesn't.

Move over Grokster: National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services
As legal and civilian discussions of Supreme Court decisions on the Ten Commandments, eminent domain and peer-to-peer file sharing continue, J. Craig Williams wonders who else is worrying about cable. Williams thinks it may have more of an effect on the Internet than Grokster: "In this latter case, the Court considered whether cable companies would be required to open up their lines to Internet service providers like Brand X and EarthLink. The Court said, "No," giving cable companies a benefit unlike the telephone companies, which are required to allow other telephone carriers access to their telephone lines. "Remember MCI? That's how they get started. EarthLink and Brand X wanted the same leg up from the cable companies. Now, however, Internet companies can't tap into cable lines, thanks to this Supreme Court decision. The effect on cable companies is certain: profit is secure and won't have to be shared. Consumers, on the other hand, may not get such a benefit, according to consumer groups ..."More here.

Do you mark up what you sub-contract and outsource?
Carolyn Elefant, writing today about her struggle with her own policy, welcomes your thoughts. She writes, "In this context, allowing a law firm to profit off contract lawyers or outsourced services is not just ethical, but further, conduct we would want to encourage.  If a firm can hire a contract attorney with a decade of experience for $100 an hour and bill her out at $200, then the client gets a far, far better product at a lower cost than if the law firm had used a junior associate.  Here, the financial reward to the firm should motivate it to enter into more of these types of arrangements that benefit all parties involved.
"But while the ethics of profiting off contract services is clear, I still can't bring myself to wholeheartedly endorse mark-ups on contract service as a matter of policy ..."Find out why and offer your comment here.
Speaking of outsourcing, Bruce MacEwen recommends this cartoon.

Why do Skadden lawyers earn twice as much as Baker ones?
So asks Bob Ambrogi, who is musing over the Am Law 100, the list of America's 100 top-grossing law firms from 2004. With an eye to their hefty accounts receiveable, Ambrogi writes: "I find it interesting that top-ranked Skadden earned $212 million more than number two Baker & McKenzie even though it has roughly half the number of lawyers -- 1,554 at Skadden compared to 2,992 at Baker. That means that, on a per-lawyer basis, Skadden's lawyers earned more than twice as much as Baker's lawyers -- $927,000 versus $410,000. The calculations for number three Latham & Watkins are more in line with Skadden -- earning $234 million less than Skadden with 52 fewer lawyers, for revenues per lawyer of $803,000. There must be more to this story than these numbers reveal."Related stories:

David Post, revisiting yesterday's immediate response to Grokster, writes today that:"The unanimous Supreme Court decision holding Grokster & StreamCast liable as contributory copyright infringers for distributing peer-to-peer file-sharing software turns out, on close examination, to be not nearly the victory for the entertainment industry it might have seemed at first glance. [This, interestingly, repeats a pattern in these cases -- Sony v. Universal Studios (the Betamax case) was not (nearly) as big a loss for Hollywood as it appeared, nor, as I have argued elsewhere, was the Napster case as big a win) ..." MoreRead on to learn what work-around you may have if your business embraces peer-to-peer file-sharing.

Holy profit$, Batman: Bloggers on Am Law 100
As the Am Law 100 list of top-grossing law firms makes its way around the Internet, crowned by a five with stunning, billion-dollar-plus earnings, the firm-watchers on Law.com's blog network have a few thoughts to add. Here's a roundup:
The Wired GC: "... These are really staggering numbers when you look at the column showing law firms with revenues into 10 figures. Sort of makes you feel less guilty about being taken to lunch. Next time I’m ordering a double cheeseburger ..."
Ron Friedmann: "Some quick (and unrelated observations) ... To the best of my knowledge, recent mergers have not changed the top-10 rankings. A couple of firms in the top 10 did merge -- Sidley Austin with Brown & Wood; Mayer Brown with Rowe & Maw -- but that was a couple of years or more ago if memory serves ..."
Mike Fox says the survey takes him back 30 years, "back to when I first was exposed to the world of "big law firms" sometime in my freshman year at the University of Texas School of Law in the fall of 1972 ... I have no clue what the annual revenues were, but I do know that the starting salaries when I graduated in the spring of 1975 was a princely $1,300 a month (the quick math is $15,600 a year.) "
Matt Homann: In his post, "Ten Law Firms that Wouldn't Hire Me Out of Law School," Homann writes that "you can order an electronic spreadsheet or subscribe to American Lawyer to see the other 90 firms that wouldn’t have hired me either." Heh.
Bruce MacEwen: "My very quick and dirty calculation of the change in revenue over last year's AmLaw 100 is that at the top (Skadden, what a shock) the increase was 8.27% ($1.440-billion vs. $1.330-billion), while at the bottom (Ballard Spahr this year, Preston Gates last year) the increase was only 5.82% ($200-million vs. $189-million).  Are the rich getting richer?  Very preliminarily, it certainly looks that way."

A sneak peek at the Am Law 100
The American Lawyer magazine and Law.com have posted this sneak peek at the Am Law 100, the list of America's 100 top-grossing law firms from 2004.
Let's just say it's been a banner year: Of the top ten firms, five firms posted revenues in excess of $1 billion in 2004. An editor sent me this snippet of the story: "Sidley Austin Brown & Wood broke the billion-dollar barrier for the first time in 2004, while the others did so previously -- Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 1999; Baker & McKenzie in 2001; and Latham & Watkins and Jones Day in 2003. Gross revenue figures on this chart are rounded to the nearest $500,000. "Here's how this chart works:
- Firms that tied in the rankings are listed alphabetically.
- Some firms provided fractional full-time equivalent or full-year equivalent lawyer numbers, which were rounded up to the nearest whole number.
- Firms marked with an asterisk have more than one partnership tier or some partners who are predominantly on fixed-income status

Is Supremes vote on Grokster "Not one-sided"?
The Supremes have laid down the law in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. et al., v. Grokster, Ltd., et al. Volokh Conspirator David Post writes that, yes, the Supremes have handed the entertainment industry a big win -- "but actually not quite as one-sided as all that." Post writes: "The full court says: even if you meet the Sony standard (i.e., even if you have "substantial noninfringing uses"), you can still be liable for inducing copyright infringement, if there's evidence that you actively encouraged or promoted infringing conduct. And there is such evidence in this case.More interestingly, though, the Court is split on the question: Can you be liable for distributing file-sharing software if you are NOT actively inducing/encouraging/promoting its use for infringing purposes ..."More here -- don't miss the trackbacks.

Which of the Ten Commandments is enforceable anyhoo?
Now that the Supremes have delivered a 5-4 ruling that forces individual courthouses to examine where they hang the Ten Commandments on a case-by-case basis (see Hope Yen's great story for The AP), The Volokh Conspiracy is digging in to the issue. My favorite post to date is blogfather Volokh's modern application of the commandments. Here's an excerpt: 5. "Honour thy father and thy mother ..." Not legally enforceable.
6. "Thou shalt not kill." Legally enforceable, though of course with the usual qualifiers.Read the entire "Nifty prose" piece. Here are some others, with terrific links off to Scotusblog and many other discussions: All posts on one page here.

Week in review: Law.com bloggers ignite nearly unite on Kelo v. New London
The Supremes' interpretation of the Fifth Amendment in Kelo v. New London has had an inflammatory effect on bloggers in the past few days -- and not a few political action groups (hence The Castle Coalition's graphic).  See Tony Mauro's report on Thursday's 5-4 ruling here.
Many a Law.com-affiliated blogger has weighed in.  In Eugene Volokh's opinion, the core debate "is over whether the "public use" requirement of the Takings Clause means (1) "the taken property must be owned by the government, or sold by the government to a common carrier that has the legal obligation to serve everyone" or (2) "the taken property must be used by the government as a means of benefiting the public, even if the government benefits the public by selling the property to a private property owner."
Few Law.com bloggers are as calm when they discuss the decision. "Whose Constitution is it anyway?" asks J. Craig Williams in a post titled, "Eminent Domain Means Never Having To Say Your Sorry As Long As It's A *Public* Benefit." VC co-conspirator Todd Zywicki is so "wound up" that he shares subject lines he wrote and tossed as too over the top, including this gem: "Wal-Mart Celebrates: Now Wal-Mart need not lobby for huge development and tax subsidies for its new stores, it can just get the government to take the land it wants ... " I kinda like it.
Over on Crime & Federalism, Timothy Sandefur takes a slightly less aggrieved perspective. He writes, "Kelo is, obviously, a deplorable example of what happens when we start tinkering with property rights to begin with. ... That being said, there is room for optimism. Kelo really does little that Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), did not already do..."

Anesthesiologists left their practices for days at a time to pore over [thousands of] closed insurance claims. Data was coded and fed into computers for analysis. What they learned led to significant changes in medical practice.
"Lawyers are totally accustomed to examining the past to see what happened. Litigators look at cases, transaction lawyers at past deals. They are not accustomed, however, to examining how they did their work. If lawyers examined how they practiced, they would undoubtedly discover many ways to improve ..."More here.

Legal Guide to Blogging
I'd like to add my voice to the many bloggers who have commended the team at the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their fantastic, consumer-friendly Legal Guide for Bloggers, launched on June 13 when I was speaking in Germany.
I have read -- on too many blogs to trackback -- that Kurt Opsahl coordinated the project, involved many people at EFF, including bloggers Donna Wentworth and Wendy Seltzer. The whole team gets credit for a legal guide that is, frankly, a fun read. At one point the FAQ reads, "Enough of your legal mumbo-jumbo, give it to me straight!" The result, as Bob Ambrogi writes, is "a legal guide that's not just for bloggers."
No indeed, says Seltzer, whom I interviewed about the guide after learning of her role heading up The Chilling Effects Clearinghouse. When I asked her about its activist tone, she told me, "Some of this document is encouraging people as they think of themselves as journalists to take advantage of some of the newsgathering opportunities that are out there. Sometimes it helps for people to go back and think from time to time about what it means that Congress can't restrict the freedom of speech or of the press. The Freedom of Information Act is a very powerful statute ... Bloggers who have a deep interest in something and expect that there might be some government records relevant to their subject should very much think about, 'Are there records that I could help bring out into the public because that's not limited to people writing for dead-tree media?'" You can hear more from Seltzer and Lauren Gelman, associate director of Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society and author of the bloggers' amicus brief in Apple v. Does, by listening to my audio interviews with them here. I spoke to them in advance of their appearance at BlogHer Conference '05, where Law.com Editorial Director Jennifer Collins will walk them through their legal tips for a consumer blogging audience.
Hint: If you're not donating to EFF and you're a blogger, you should be. Off to walk my talk ...

There is no indication that any of the requests were related to the Patriot Act; no indication of what kind of information investigators sought or why; and no indication of whether this number is higher or lower than pre-2001 contact rates. Nonetheless, the ALA is claiming that this shows the DOJ is lying to the Amercian people that it isn't conducting surveillance at libraries..."Find out here what Kerr thinks and why.

Mike Fox reports:"Justice Thomas writing for the Court found the 6-year statute of limitations for qui tam actions, added in 1986, is not applicable to the retaliation provision of that statute which was added the same year. Instead, courts should look to the most applicable state statute of limitations. Graham County Soil & Water Conservation District v. United States ex. rel. Wilson (U.S. 6/20/05) [pdf] ..."

EU patent directive: "absurdity" or "turning point"?
In his post on software patentability policy in the European Union, Bill Heinze reports that, "According to a June 20, 2005, report by EurActive, 'The Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee adopted the draft directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions. Most of the major amendments proposed by the rapporteur, Michel Rocard, and other MEPs critical of the proposal were rejected ...'"More here.

Get your blog on, part II
"How will that help me in my practice?" That question and others are part of Bob Ambrogi's post on yet another perspective on attorneys and blogs. The day after Carolyn Elefant said "Doing what you can is certainly better than doing nothing at all," Ambrogi writes:  "Blogging is still a foreign concept to most legal professionals. Out of about 60 attendees (lawyers and paralegals), only two said they had ever heard of blogs. The value of blogging is difficult to convey in a seminar. To appreciate blogs, one has to dive in and use them for awhile ..."Update: Don't miss J. Craig Williams' insights on why to blog.

I win! No -- I win! California applies State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Campbell
California has tested the limits of punitive damages in two recent state supreme court decisions, Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding, and Johnson v. Ford Motor. State supreme justices essentially reduced a $1.7 million verdict to $5,000 and a $10 million verdict to $53,435 plus a visit to an appellate court for more review, respectively. (Here's the Law.com Newswire report.)
According to J. Craig Williams, however, these decisions demonstrate that, for plaintiffs and defendants and the attorneys crafting their cases, the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Campbell is still up for interpretation:  "[T]hose decisions also left states some wiggle room, and wiggle California has done."In response to the pair of California cases on punitive damages, Plaintiffs' lawyers claim it's a win and Defense lawyers claim it's a win. Yes, I know the last two links are exactly the same; that's my point."Nobody's quite sure yet."Do we still have some more wiggling to do? Here's how Justice Werdegar put it: 'California law has long endorsed the use of punitive damages to deter continuation or imitation of a corporation's course of wrongful conduct, and hence allowed consideration of that conduct's scale and profitability,' she said in the Johnson case. 'We do not read the high court's decisions, which specifically acknowledge that states may use punitive damages for punishment and deterrence, as mandating the abandonment of that principle ...'"More here.

Get your blog on -- without a monkey on your back
Carolyn Elefant has some sage words of encouragement to lawyers who want to blog -- but fear the spectre of multiple, daily deadlines. Citing her recent article for GP Solo, Elefant writes: "I realize that many serious bloggers advise that a blog can't succeed without multiple, regular postings or that you can't optimize the benefits of a blog without reading feed from dozens.  I disagree. Whether it's blogging or exercise or saving money any other new habit one wants to acquire, I don't think you always need to go all out to realize the benefits.  Doing what you can is certainly better than doing nothing at all ..."This is just a taster -- read her proof of concept here. For what it's worth, I agree -- my work here and here makes it impossible for me to update my personal blog daily. But I still find it valuable to have a soapbox at the ready and an opportunity to write about my professional life. If you're interested in blogging, or if you're asking yourself, "Why blogs?" I urge you to go for it.

Training day at Tyco: What they missed
The Wired GC has a hint for colleagues who may have to evangelize a better "tone at the top" than Tyco executives achieved before last week's bruising decision. As we know, the company's high-living CEO and CFO were found guilty on 22 criminal counts by a New York jury, who apparently took issue with their inability to explain why certain "compensation" (a) was news to the board (b) wasn't reported.
The Wired GC suggests, During compliance training, I like to use a common response when someone asks if conduct X is potentially a problem. "Think about your parents, spouse or child reading about it in the newspaper" is the reply.
"I think I know two people who might have had some faint recollection of that concept last Saturday morning ..."
