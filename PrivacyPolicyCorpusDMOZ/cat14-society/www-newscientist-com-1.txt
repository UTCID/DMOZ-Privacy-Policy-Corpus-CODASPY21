How do I advertise with New Scientist?
For further information about our advertising solutions, please see our media information. Find this at any time by clicking the “Advertise with us” link at the bottom of every page.
How can I contact the author of an article?
A list of contact information for New Scientist is located here. You can email the section the article appeared in for further information (Features, News, Letters, Feedback or The Last Word).
Remember that the easiest way to contact companies mentioned in the text of an article is to call directory enquiries for a number, as our journalists are very busy and may take some time to get back to you with information. Likewise, reports or articles referred to in news stories are best obtained from the publisher of the individual report or article, rather than New Scientist, which is simply writing about the report.
I have a product/discovery I would like New Scientist to cover. Where should I send the information?
Press releases should be sent to our news desk. We regret that due to the number of press releases received, a personal reply will not usually be possible.
How do I get in touch with an expert on my illness?
The staff at New Scientist magazine are not medical experts, and as such we are not equipped to advise on medical matters. If you have questions about your illness, then you should approach your family doctor, who will be best placed to advise you about your own condition.
One of your articles mentioned a product I would like to buy, how can I get in touch with the supplier?
If an article mentions a product, the article itself will usually contain all the necessary information to track down the research team or company developing the product, and online articles will often have a link. It is unlikely that we have any further details we would be able to disclose.
I would like to have my letter published in the magazine’s Letters section. What are the terms and conditions?
Letters to the Editor are for publication. Include your full postal address and telephone number, and a reference (issue, page number, title) to articles. We reserve the right to edit letters. New Scientist reserves the right to use any submissions sent to the letters column of New Scientist magazine, in any other format. If you want to send a private message about the content of an article, you should find the appropriate department here. Due to the volume of correspondence we receive, we regret that we cannot guarantee a reply.

If you are interested in re-using New Scientist material you should read the syndication page for information on permissible use of content and to ensure you will not be violating copyright.

Most of the photographs we use come from photo libraries – check the credit next to the picture for the name of the company. The copyright on these pictures does not belong to New Scientist, and we can’t give permission to use them. If you can’t find a number for the photo library in question, you can email the picture desk for contact information. New Scientist does commission a lot of original artwork, but the copyright always belongs to the artist who did the work.

How do I apply for a permanent position at New Scientist?

What is “sponsored content”?
Selected organisations sponsor New Scientist content in return for the display of their name and logo. New Scientist retains full editorial control, giving no sponsor any influence over any content, including choice of topics, the views expressed, or the style of presentation.
Can I send in an article for publication in New Scientist?
The vast majority of the news section of New Scientist magazine is written by staffers but we do publish the occasional freelance piece. Most of our feature articles are written either by researchers (who usually give first hand accounts of work in which they are involved) or by science journalists, but we are open to anyone who can write in our style on topics which we find exciting. We don’t encourage people to send in full-length material out of the blue because we will often not have time to read it. If you have a good idea for a feature article, you should send a short synopsis – no more than 400 words – by email to the features editor. If you are a freelance journalist interested in pitching a news story, please check our Guide for Freelancers for further information. And everyone is welcome to send letters for publication, though you must include a postal address for your letter to be published.
I am writing an essay, research paper or project and hope you can help.
