Last updated: 17 August 2020Our privacy policy summarises how we handle your personal information.

The Privacy Act
We comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) when we handle personal information.

We also disclose personal information to overseas recipients with consent or where authorised or required by, or under law, or in accordance with an international treaty or convention.

When the personal information that we collect is no longer required, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner, in accordance with the requirements of the Archives Act 1983 and IP Australia’s Record Disposal Authority.
