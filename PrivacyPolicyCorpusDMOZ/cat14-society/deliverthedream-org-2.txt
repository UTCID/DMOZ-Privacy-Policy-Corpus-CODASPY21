Music Is Helping Us Feel Close While We Stay Safe at Home
It’s important that we all do our part to limit the spread of Covid-19, but it is not always easy staying home – especially for the families served by our charity who have children with cancer and a range of other serious illnesses and conditions. The staff and volunteers who make our kids’ charity the amazing force it is are working from home to continue the mission of Deliver the Dream.
We told you about Hope from Home, our virtual program for children staying home and staying-safe, in a previous blog post. The Campfire Series, which features online concerts from talented musicians and singer/songwriters, is an exciting part of our online offerings. The series allows the children and families we serve as well as the generous supporters who donate to our charity to gather together to enjoy the beauty and the balm of live music. It’s also an opportunity to see friends and familiar faces – even if it is on a screen.
Upcoming concerts in the Campfire Series include:
SARA ANN
June 12, 2020 from 7 pm to 8 pm on Zoom
Sara Ann is a talented singer/songwriter/musician based in South Florida. She performs as a solo artist in shows that feature her guitar and piano playing skills along with her vocals and as a lead vocalist with a full band. To register, please click here.
SHAUNA SWEENEY
June 26, 2020 from 7 to 8 pm on Zoom
The multi-talented Shauna Sweeney is a singer, songwriter, guitar player and percussionist. She has opened for the Gin Blossoms, 10,000 Maniacs and Donavon Frankenreiter, among others, and has performed at thousands of other events.  To register, please click here.
“The beauty of music therapy is that it helps people in a physical, mental, emotional and social way,” the website CPR Certified says. “Music therapy can help to improve everything from a patient’s speech to their memory and physical balance. It also provides emotional healing, helping people to develop positive self-image and aids in prioritizing stress and pain. Music also helps people take their mind off of physical pain, which can help them cope with a number of ailments.”
We will hope to see you at the next concert in our Campfire Series! If you can’t make it but would like to support the children our charity serves, we would welcome your donation to our nonprofit charity for children and families.
