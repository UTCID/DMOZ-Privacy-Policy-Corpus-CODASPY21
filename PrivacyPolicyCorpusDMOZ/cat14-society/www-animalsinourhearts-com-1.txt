Privacy PolicyYour privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the animalsinourhearts.com website. On various pages, you can sign up to receive newsletters, register for workshops, pay for consultations, order products, or email us. Requested personal information may include but not be limited to your name, email address, postal address, or phone number. We do not collect credit card numbers on this site. All credit card payments are made through Paypal which increases the security of online payments made to Animals in our Hearts. We have no record of your credit card information at any time.
We do not share your personal contact information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order such as entering it into a USPS system to print a mailing label.
When you share your email address and other contact information with us by emailing us, as part of the required information for attending workshops and events or purchasing products, that information is not shared with or sold to other organizations. If you receive periodic product update information or newsletters from us after attending one of our events or purchasing products and wish to be taken off our mailing list, you can unsubscribe at any time with one “unsubscribe” click at the bottom of any received mailing or by emailing us with your request.
If you are a Registered Customer or Registered Wholesale Customer, you can access all your personally identifiable information that you have submitted by logging into your store account and changing the information.
IP AddressesFor each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name & IP address, not the e-mail address or any other contact information. An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer and available whenever you access the Internet. If you access pages from this website, our server will enter your IP address into a log. We reserve the right to store IP addresses for a period of time to assist law enforcement authorities and Internet Service Providers in the investigation of breaches of our in-house rules or terms of service and to help identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others.
We may also use this information to measure site traffic for purposes of system administration. This aggregate data also helps us to improve our website and our business. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
Our Commitment To Data SecurityTo prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children's PrivacyProtecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
Product Refund and Replacement Policy In the rare event that a product received is defective or damaged in transit, please notify us immediately so we may discuss what happened and make arrangements to replace the item or issue a refund. Notification to Animals in our Hearts about any product problems must be received within 30 days of your order confirmation for refunds or replacements to be issued.
Consultation Refunds What is Refunded: If a consultation is cancelled before 24 hours of the scheduled session, a full refund will be made. If a client is unhappy with the messages from their animals during a session, and makes that clear to me during the session, I am happy to end the consultation and refund the unused time on a pro-rated basis.
What is Not Refunded: If after a consultation a client is unhappy with the information and messages translated and shared from their animal to me, refunds are not provided. My commitment to my clients is to work diligently and consciously in every consultation to listen to their animals for both the facts and feelings the animals convey to me and to describe these to my clients in a clear, understandable, supportive and loving manner. I intentionally provide ample time during sessions—at several junctions—for clients to comment on what their animal has expressed. As stated above, if a client is unhappy with the messages from their animals, and makes that clear to me during a session, I am happy to end the consultation and refund the unused time on a pro-rated basis.
However, if a client does not speak up about any confusion or displeasure about the messages from their animals during a session, but waits until after the consultation to do so and requests a refund, a refund will not be provided. I wholeheartedly and genuinely want my clients and their animals to be helped by and pleased with our consultations. However, it is extremely important to note that no animal communicator, including me, can guarantee that a client will be pleased with what their animal has to say or even how they say it. Animal communicators can tell you what your animal is saying but we cannot make you like it, agree with it, or believe it. I cannot assume responsibility for another person’s reactions to their animals’ messages. Because of this, refunds are not provided for anyone who, after a session, states that they were unhappy with the messages conveyed.
Cancellations PoliciesConsultationsScheduled consultation times are reserved exclusively for the person making the appointment. As a courtesy to Teresa's full schedule of other work commitments and to other clients waiting for appointments, please give 24 hour notice if you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment. Missed appointments with no notice and appointments canceled within 24 hours will be charged the full amount of the consultation fee.Payment is expected by the day prior to a scheduled appointment time. If your payment is not received by that time, we will notify you that it hasn't been received and that your session needs to be rescheduled. When your payment is received we will contact you again to reschedule your session for the earliest available opening.
WorkshopsAll payments for workshops are non-refundable unless the workshop is cancelled by Animals in our Hearts at which time all deposits and payments will be refunded. Individuals who need to cancel their participation in a workshop may offer their paid seat in a workshop to a friend or other party. Original payment for that workshop seat will remain with Animals in our Hearts.
