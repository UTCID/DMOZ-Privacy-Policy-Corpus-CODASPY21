Non-discrimination Policy – Career Services Office
It is the policy of the University of Maine School of Law not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, transgender status, gender expression, national origin, citizenship status, age, disability, genetic information, or veteran status in its education program, admissions policies, employment policies, and other school-administered programs. Employers who discriminate in violation of the school’s policy or who refuse to sign an acknowledgment of our policy are denied access to the Law School’s Career Services Office. A limited exception to this policy exists for military recruiters and federal agencies but only to the extent that their employment and hiring practices are permitted under federal law. This exception to the University’s policy does not in any way reflect acceptance of, or agreement with, discriminatory hiring practices. Anyone with information that any employer discriminates should contact the director of career services or the dean of the Law School.
The University of Maine School of Law is an EEO/AA employer, and does not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, transgender status, gender expression, national origin, citizenship status, age, disability, genetic information or veteran’s status in employment, education, and all other programs and activities.
