Adopt a Bird
Click here to adopt one of our education ambassadors
If you have any questions or issues in registering, contact us at office@houstonaudubon.org.
Houston Audubon's animal ambassadors are the hardest working critters in Texas! Our raptors and other animals inspire 30,000 people a year by teaching them about native Texas wildlife at schools, libraries, hospitals, and more. Your generous support through the adoption program ensures high-quality housing at our Raptor and Education Center, food, veterinary care, and training. Since these birds can no longer return to the wild, they now receive the best care possible and bring the “wild” to audiences across the Houston-Galveston region, thanks to you. All adoption levels are fully tax deductible.
