THE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION EDUCATION CENTER/ [LINE BREAK] ILLINOIS COUNCIL AGAINST HANDGUN VIOLENCE
The Gun Violence Prevention Education Center (GPEC) and the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence (ICHV) are combining forces to be a preeminent leader in the fight to reduce death and injury caused by gun violence in Illinois through education, research, organizing and enforcement around public policy. We are preparing to maximize impact by organizing operations, identifying strengths, and strategically expanding the gun violence prevention (GVP) efforts already in progress.
Using proven digital and grassroots strategies, GPEC and ICHV will come together to build a powerful network that holds institutions accountable for passing and enforcing common sense gun policies.
