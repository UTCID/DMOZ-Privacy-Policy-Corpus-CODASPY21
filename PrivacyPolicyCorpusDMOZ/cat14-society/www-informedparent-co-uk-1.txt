Shouldn't the after-effects of vaccination be discussed before?
TIP Privacy Policy
This Policy is effective as of May 25th, 2018 and compliant with GDPR.
What is GDPR?
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was passed by the EU Parliament in April of 2016. Replacing the Data Protection Directive from the 90s, it’s the biggest overarching legislative change in data privacy regulation to take place the last 20 years.
GDPR was created to standardize data privacy laws throughout Europe—and to put greater protection on the data privacy of EU citizens. The big changes are:
A Change in Legislative Scope: Now, all controllers and processors in the EU are subject to GDPR—even if the data they’re accessing is processed outside of the EU. The reverse is also true. If you’re a company processing the data of EU citizens (either to offer goods and services, or to monitor behavior taking place in the EU)—it doesn’t matter where you’re based, or where you’re processing the data. You still have to comply with GDPR.
Greater Penalties for noncompliance: The maximum fine for noncompliance with GDPR is up to 4% of annual global turnover, or 20 million euros—depending on which is greater.
Strengthened Conditions for Consent: No more legalese. Consent has to be given in an easy, accessible way before processing a persons data. You also have to disclose the purpose for that data processing, and make it as easy to withdraw consent as to give it.
A full list of the key GDPR changes can be found on the EU GDPR website here.
