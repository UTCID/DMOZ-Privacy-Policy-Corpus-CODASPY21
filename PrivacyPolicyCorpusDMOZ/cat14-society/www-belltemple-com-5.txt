We know it is not if, but when.
With the incidence of data breaches proliferating the globe, insurance has become critical to comprehensively managing the response and mitigating the loss for all types of organizations.
With the Canadian Mandatory Privacy Breach Notification Regulations coming into force November 1, 2018, and the GDPR on May 25, 2018, we are focusing on educating and consulting for organizations on the importance of preparedness and the role of insurance as part of their mitigation strategy.
We provide a full range of legal advisory services, from planning and risk management to post-breach coaching. We partner with reputable forensic consultants. Our team leverages their knowledge of national and international legislation and regulatory frameworks to implement cost-effective and strategic plans to assist businesses with data protection and breach response.
With the introduction of the Canadian Mandatory Privacy Breach Notification Regulations we expect an uptake in breach reporting and potential litigation. Our exceptional experience in the courtroom will be an asset to data breach defence litigation.
Areas of Experience:
• Strategic Risk Assessments
• Incident Response Plans
• Data Breach Coaching
• Litigation
DRONES (UAVs)
As part of our technology focus, we have legal advisory experience in the area of drones from a commercial and healthcare perspective. We work with clients who are innovators in the area of drones and healthcare.
We partnered with EDIT (Expo for Design, Innovation & Technology) which took place in Toronto in October 2017, where Katherine Kolnhofer curated and hosted a panel on the use of Drones (UAVs) in facilitating healthcare initiatives. She explored the various liability risks, privacy concerns and insurance coverage issues. EDIT was an international event which partnered with the UNDP and was supported by high profile sponsors and world renowned innovators.
As drones enter the commercial and healthcare market, Canada is developing a regulatory framework to address the privacy and liability risks, and is mandating liability insurance for drone operators. Insurers are also seeking to utilize drones to monitor and assess losses in catastrophic environmental situations or difficult to reach loss zones. The use of drones is also emerging with organizations in specialized industries such as mining, oil and gas to monitor equipment for the purposes of loss prevention and mitigation.
In Canada, UAV operators must apply for a Special Flights Operations Certificate (SFOC), follow the rules in the Canadian Aviation Regulations, respect the Criminal Code, and adhere to any applicable municipal, provincial, and territorial laws that may apply. We provide legal support to our clients at every stage of UAV operations, from application through to Regulatory compliance.
