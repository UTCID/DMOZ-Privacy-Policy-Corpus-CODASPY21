Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we may personalize our Sites. To do so, we may link together and analyze the Personal Data that we hold about you. Personal Data processed for personalization purposes, whether or not linked, may be augmented with Preferences Data. We may create Preferences Data, or obtain it from third parties, using Personal Data we hold about you. We process Preferences Data so that our communications and Sites are more relevant to you.

We may also use Preferences Data in connection with use analytics. See Your Rights and Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of this processing.
USE ANALYTICS

The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for use analytics purposes may build a profile of you containing this information, and may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time. These services may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have used certain services. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to direct services to, determine whether and how services you use are effective, and may augment your profile with information derived from these observations. See Your Rights and Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of this processing.

Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our affiliates or trusted third parties) may send you promotional communications to the extent allowed by law: if you sign up for such communications, download content from us, register on our Sites or for a promotion or contest with us or a partner, or in connection with your communications with, or submission of User Content to, us. These communications may be personalized. See Your Rights and Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of promotional communications.
