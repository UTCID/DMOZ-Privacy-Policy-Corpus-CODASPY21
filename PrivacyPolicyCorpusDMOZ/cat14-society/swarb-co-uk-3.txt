(Appeal from High Court of Justiciary (Scotland)) It was not an infringement of a defendant’s right to a fair trial where the costs of defending the case brought against him would be substantial, but where his solicitors would be paid only a small fixed fee sum. In this case the defendants had the benefit of solicitors and counsel continuing to act for them, despite any such difficulty. The difficulty of conflict of interest in a solicitor under financial pressure to deal with a case simply was to be controlled by the professional standards governing his activities. Where however, because of the regulations, no representation could be found, the defendant’s right to a fair trial might be prejudiced, and some solution had to be found.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead agreed with Lord Hope: ‘1. As Lord Hope has indicated, there are respects in which these solicitors, remunerated in accordance with the Criminal Legal Aid (Fixed Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1999, (SI 1999 No 491) will not receive reasonable remuneration for the work done by them in this case. This cannot be regarded as a satisfactory state of affairs. But this does not, of itself, afford a sufficient ground for supposing that, if the solicitors continue to act, they may fail properly to discharge their professional responsibilities towards their clients. 2. Different considerations would arise if the solicitors were to withdraw, and the appellants were unable to find replacement solicitors because of the inflexibility of the 1999 fixed payment regulations. But at present this is no more than a speculative possibility. I will therefore say nothing further about the position which might then arise, especially as the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Bill is currently before the Scottish Parliament.’Lord Hope said: ‘I share the concerns which my noble and learned friends Lord Clyde and Lord Hobhouse have expressed about the potential for injustice which is inherent in the fixed payment regime. A scheme which provides for various items of work and the associated outlays to be paid for in stages, for each of which a prescribed amount will be paid as a fixed fee, will not necessarily be incompatible with the Convention right to a fair trial. But the greater the inflexibility the greater is the risk that occasionally, especially in exceptional or unusual cases, the scheme will lead to injustice.’Lord Clyde stated: ‘But I do not consider that it would be right to leave the case without making some observations on the present form of the regulations. While I have not been persuaded that they have caused, or on the present information are likely to cause, a contravention of Article 6 in the present case, it seems to me that there is a real likelihood that in another case a serious risk of a contravention may arise. If the result of the regulations is that no legal representative is available for an accused in a case where the Convention requires that he should be represented, then a breach will occur. This does not seem to me to be a fanciful possibility. We were informed that cases have occurred where as a result of the regulations no solicitor has been found to act for an accused person. The case of Glendinning in Perth Sheriff Court (February 2001) was quoted to us as an example.
. . I see nothing wrong in principle in a scheme which proceeds upon a basis of fixed sums for specified work. Moreover, in so far as the approach adopted recognises that different cases will require different amounts of work, and that different cases will have different degrees of profitability, the policy of adopting a basis of a fixed sum may not in itself be unreasonable if in its general operation the solicitors engaged in the work covered by the regulations, taking as it were the rough with the smooth, will find the amounts acceptable. And it is right to recognise that the scheme is not altogether rigid. In a rough and ready way account is taken of the extra costs involved in a long trial, reflecting the extra work involved. Moreover the outlays covered by the fixed sums are only the ‘prescribed outlays’ and that phrase may be open to construction so as to allow for outlays, but not fees, which fall outside the scope of the definition. In that connection it is to be remembered that in deciding whether or not the regulations comply with the Convention every effort of construction has to be made in order to avoid such a contravention. Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires subordinate legislation to be construed in a way compatible with the Convention ‘[S]o far as it is possible to do so’. That approach may go some way to avoid a contravention, but if it is found to be impossible to find a compliance by any technique of interpretation, the consequence may be an invalidity in the regulations. It appears that the danger has been recognised by the Scottish Executive, in that some provision for a remedy has been incorporated in the current Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Bill. This allows for the making of regulations to prevent a person being deprived of the right to a fair trial. No draft regulations were shown to us and it remains unclear what solution is to be devised. The most obvious, but perhaps not the only, risk may arise from the lack of flexibility in the present regulations. No allowance is made for any unusual or exceptional circumstances. The requirements of fairness in judicial proceedings are rarely, if ever, met by blanket measures of universal application. Universal policies which make no allowance for exceptional cases will not readily meet the standards required for fairness and justice.’Lord Hobhouse said: ‘There is much to be said for schemes of legal aid which reduce the bureaucracy involved provided that they do not undermine the principle that the lawyer should receive fair remuneration for the work which he is required to do.. . ‘As has been pointed out, the critical defect in the 1999 Regulations is their inflexibility. A more sophisticated code for predefined fixed payments might avoid the pitfalls but the First Schedule to the 1999 Regulations is anything but sophisticated. If the 1999 Regulations are to be retained as the structure, they need to be amended to incorporate an element of flexibility to give the Legal Aid Board the power to avoid breaches of Article 6 of the Convention. This is apparently also the view of the Scottish Executive. It has introduced into the Scottish Parliament the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Bill to amend certain enactments, including those relating to legal advice and assistance and legal aid, which are or may be incompatible with the convention and to enable further changes in the law where there is or may be incompatibility. Clause 8 of the Bill would amend the 1986 Act, with retrospective effect, so as to enable the fixed payment regime to be amended so as to avoid accused persons being ‘deprived of the right to a fair trial’. This is a welcome development even though the proposed revised regulations have not yet been published even in draft.’ Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Clyde, Lord Hobhouse Gazette 12-Jul-2001, [2001] 1 WLR 2425, [2001] UKPC D3, 2001 GWD 19-720, 2001 SCCR 475, 2001 SLT 780, 2002 SC (PC) 1, [2001] UKHRR 793 PC, PC, Bailii Criminal Legal Aid (Fixed Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1999, European Convention on Human Rights 6 Scotland Cited by: Cited – Regina v Moore CACD 12-May-2003

The defendant sought legal aid to defend an action to abate a statutory nuisance under the 1936 Act. Held: Such an action was criminal in nature. The action had been brought under section 99, but the imposition of a penalty under s94 was a criminal sentence. ‘On analysis, the position seem to be that proceedings are initiated by information under section 99, and that the information is then dealt with under section 94(2). It appears plain that the proceedinbgs under section 94(2) are criminal in character. The offence is the wrongdoing which leads to whatever order is in fact made; in this case, putting it generally, allowing premises to be in such a state as to be prejudicial to health.’ Mann LJ [1989] 1 WLR 408 Public Health Act 1936 9492), Legal Aid Act 1974 28(5) Citing:

There was an interlocutory dispute over the granting of an extension of time for service of the defence. The legally aided plaintiff challenged the costs orders made by the district registrar and the judge. Each ordered that the costs be the defendants’, ‘not to be enforced without leave of the court save by way of set-off as against damages and/or costs’. Held: The plaintiff’s appeal on the costs order failed. ‘The issue in this appeal is whether, in a case where one party is legally aided, an order for costs in favour of the other party can direct that those costs be set-off against either damages or costs to which the legally aided party has become, or may in future become, entitled in the action.’ The court confirmed the right of a party to set off a costs award against a subsequent damages or costs award in favour of an assisted person. Section 16(8) simply preserved those rights of set-off that the general law would allow and protected them against the charge created by section 16(6). It did not create any new right of set-off. Its effect was to make it clear that whatever rights of set-off were available under the general law were available against legally aided parties notwithstanding the board’s charge.Scott LJ discussed the principles applying on an application for set-off costs: ‘The broad criterion for the application of set-off is that the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s claim are so closely connected that it would be inequitable to allow the plaintiff’s claim without taking into account the defendant’s claim. As it has sometimes been put, the defendant’s claim must, in equity, impeach the plaintiff’s claim.
Set-off of costs or damages to which one party is entitled against costs or damages to which another party is entitled depends upon the application of the equitable criterion I have endeavoured to express. It was treated by May J in Currie and Co v The Law Society [1977] QB 990, 1000, as a ‘question for the court’s discretion’. It is possible to regard all questions regarding costs as being subject to the statutory discretion conferred on the court by section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981. But I would not have thought that a set-off of damages against damages could properly be described as a discretionary matter, nor that a set-off of costs against damages could be so described.’ and ‘A set-off of costs against costs, when all are incurred in the prosecution or defence of the same action, seems so natural and equitable as not to need any special justification. I would expect a party objecting to the set-off to give some special reason for the objection. It is, in my opinion, less obvious that a set-off of costs against damages would always be justified.’ Farquharson LJ, Sir John Megaw, Scott L [1992] 1 WLR 492, [1992] 2 All ER 589 Legal Aid Act 1974 16(8) England and Wales Citing:

The plaintiff could not recover damages for the mental distress of conducting litigation. The court found it difficult to draw the line as to where such damage could be identified. In this case the damage could not reasonably be said to have flowed from the solicitor’s failures about which the complaint was made: ‘In these circumstances I think that, just as in the law of tort, so also in the law of contract, damages can be recovered for nervous shock or anxiety state if it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence. So the question became this: when a client goes to a solicitor, is it a reasonably foreseeable consequence that, if anything goes wrong with the litigation owing to the solicitor’s negligence, there will be a breakdown in health? It can be foreseen that there will be injured feelings; mental distress; anger; and annoyance; but for none of these can damage be recovered. It was so held in Groom v. Crocker [1939] 1 K.B. 194 on the same lines as Addis v. Gramophone Co. [1909] A.C. 488. Is it reasonably foreseeable that there may be an actual breakdown in health? I do not think so. It was suggested in this case that there were special circumstances in that Mrs. Cook was peculiarly liable to nervous shock. I am afraid she was. The history of her life shows one nervous breakdown after another. If this special circumstance was brought home to Mr. Swinfen, it might enlarge the area of foreseeability so as to make him liable. But it was not pleaded. and when Mr. Moloney put questions to Mr. Swinfen, he did not succeed in showing that special circumstances were brought home to him. All Mr. Swinfen knew was that she was a woman obviously highly strung and worried as any woman would be in the circumstances. But that does not mean that he should foresee that, if he was negligent, she would suffer injury to health. In all these cases of nervous shock and breakdown in mental health, it is very difficult to draw the line. In King v. Phillips [1953] 1 Q.B. 429, 442 I asked: ‘Where is the line to be drawn?’ I found the answer given by Lord Wright: ‘Only where’ in the particular case the good sense of the judge decides”.’ Lord Denning MR [1967] 1 WLR 457 England and Wales Citing:

They acted for him and, in the absence of proof of an agreement between him and them or between them and the insurance company that he would not pay their costs, they could look to him for payment for the work done and his liability would not be excluded by the fact that the insurance company had itself agreed to pay their costs.

The House considered the impact of the statutory charge under the 1974 Act in matrimonial proceedings. Held: The costs in respect of which the statutory charge bit were the costs of the whole divorce proceedings and not just the financial relief aspect. For property to have been ‘recovered or transferred’ for this purpose, its ownership or transfer had to have actually been in issue in the proceedings. The House gave guidance on the interpretation of Legal Aid Statutes: ‘The subsection, being an adaption for the benefit of the legal aid fund of Victorian legislation enacted for the benefit of solicitors, inevitably presents problems of interpretation. Two fall to be considered in this appeal. The first is to identify the proceedings to which the subsection applies. The second is to determine the meaning of the words ‘recovered or preserved” Lord Simon said: ‘property has been recovered or preserved if it has been in issue in the proceedings – recovered by the claimant if it has been the subject of a successful claim, preserved to the respondent if the claim fails. In either case it is a question of fact, not of theoretical ‘risk.’ In property adjustment proceedings, in my view, it is only property the ownership or transfer of which has been in issue which has been ‘recovered or preserved’ so as to be the subject of a legal aid charge. What has been in issue is to be collected as a matter of fact from pleadings, evidence, judgment and/or order. I can see no reason for extending the words to items of property the ownership or possession of which has never been questioned.’ As to the use of punctuation, Lord Lowry: ‘To ignore punctuation disregards the reality that literate people, such as parliamentary draftsmen, do punctuate what they write.’Lord Lowry set out the circumstances in which a regulation made under a statutory power was admissible for the purpose of construing the statute under which it was made. Judges may look at the punctuation in order to interpret the meaning of legislation accepted by Parliament.Lord Scarman said that in most cases a reference to the legal aid certificate would determine the extent of the charge. In two cases where this would not be appropriate – the inclusion in the certificate of proceedings which ought not to have been included such as proceedings for which legal aid was not available and the inclusion in one certificate of two sets of proceedings for which separate certificates should have been issued.

The two parents sought to challenge a decision that their child should be taken into care. Each parent had learning difficulties, but their income though small precluded the grant of legal aid. They wished to appeal against final care orders, but such cases did not come within the exemptions. Held: Sir James Munby spoke of the severe inequity and consequences of the withdrawal of legal aid: ‘The father has a learning disability. He is a ‘protected party’ within the meaning of Rule 2.3 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. As a matter of law he is not able, as a protected party, to act without a litigation friend. Quite apart from that, the father’s learning disability in any event requires him to have considerable support and assistance to be able to participate effectively in the proceedings. The Official Solicitor has agreed to act as his litigation friend. The Official Solicitor cannot be compelled to act as anyone’s litigation friend. His practice is to agree to act only if there is funding for the protected party’s litigation costs, because his own budget – the monies voted to him by Parliament – is not sufficient to enable him to fund the costs of litigation of the type the father is involved in. The Official Solicitor was willing to act here only because the father’s solicitor and counsel have agreed to act, thus far, pro bono. But without the protection against an adverse costs order which the father (and derivatively the Official Solicitor) would enjoy if the father had legal aid, the Official Solicitor has a possible exposure to an adverse costs order – for instance, if the local authority was to obtain an order for costs against him – which, understandably, he is unwilling to assume. The consequence is that the Official Solicitor was not willing to act as the father’s litigation friend unless Ms Stevens agreed, as she has, to indemnify him against any adverse costs orders. And as if all this was not enough – indeed, far more than enough – I am told that Ms Stevens has spent in excess of 100 hours, all unremunerated, working to resolve, thus far without success, the issue of the father’s entitlement to legal aid. This is devotion to the client far above and far beyond the call of duty.’ Sir James Munby P SN14C00004 Judiciary Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and Pa

The appellant argued that the Costs Practice Direction, supplementing Parts 43-48 of the CPR, had the same force in law as the Legal Aid in Family Proceedings (Remuneration) Regulations 1991; and that they impliedly amended or repealed them in so far as they were inconsistent. Held: The argument was rejected. Hale LJ said: ‘Unlike the Lord Chancellor’s orders under his ‘Henry VIII’ powers, the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 themselves and the 1991 Remuneration Regulations, the Practice Directions are not made by Statutory Instrument. They are not laid before Parliament or subject to either the negative or positive resolution procedures in Parliament. They go though no democratic process at all, although if approved by the Lord Chancellor he will bear ministerial responsibility for them to Parliament. But there is a difference in principle between delegated legislation which may be scrutinised by Parliament and ministerial executive action. There is no ministerial responsibility for Practice Directions made for the Supreme Court by the Heads of Division. As Professor Jolowicz says . . ‘It is right that the court should retain its power to regulate its own procedure within the limits set by statutory rules, and to fill in gaps left by those rules; it is wrong that it should have power actually to legislate’.’ Hale LJ [2001] 1 FLR 602 Legal Aid in Family Proceedings (Remuneration) Regulations 1991, Civil Procedure Rules England and Wales Cited by:

This was a criminal appeal by solicitors who had submitted their bill of costs in which work was claimed at prescribed legal aid rates for grade A fee earner level, which was however accompanied by a letter, which started with the following paragraphs: ‘We are grateful for the kind extension of time granted to submit our bill of costs with the further extension allowing us to send our papers by DX on Monday 22 instant. Enhancement is respectfully claimed in this case for the following reasons …’ No percentage enhancement however is actually mentioned in either this letter, or of course in the bill. The Determining Officer refused to allow any enhancement, holding that what he had to consider was the bill and that any accompanying letter was a supporting document not to be read as part of the bill. The Costs Judge affirmed the decision of the Determining Officer, but granted a certificate to allow the matter to proceed to a final appeal in the High Court. On the facts the Judge decided the appeal against the solicitors, but he did lay down some general principles to be followed in future cases to ensure that decisions of Determining Officers were not ‘Wednesbury unreasonable’. He apparently suggested that the Determining Officer could, in a situation such as arose here, either refer the whole bill back to the solicitors to make a proper claim to include enhancement; he could deal with it as if enhancement had been claimed; or he could make reasonable enquiries. What seems to have been fatal to the solicitors’ appeal in this case is that they neither claimed enhancement in the bill itself, nor did they specify in the accompanying letter what rate of enhancement they were seeking. However in the light of the Judge’s comments summarised above it seems unlikely that this situation will recur. The Judge made no order as to the costs of the appeal, although the Lord Chancellor’s Department was represented by counsel. References: [2001] EW Costs 12 Judges:

CourtService In these two related appeals heard together the learned Judge dealt with the appropriate penalty to apply when Regulation 109 of the Legal Aid (General) Regulations was invoked. In the first case there had been a delay of 4 years between the conclusion of the proceedings and the notice of commencement of the assessment proceedings, which the Deputy Costs Judge had held to be totally unreasonable, so that he allowed no profit costs whatsoever. The authorities were reviewed. A complete disallowance of the solicitors’ profit costs was not an appropriate remedy, bearing in mind that the Legal Services Commission had not suffered any prejudice, and indeed the only prejudice suffered might have been that of the claimants’ solicitors. The Judge did not feel it appropriate to lay down any rule in relation to such applications, but, on the facts of this case where the bill was some andpound;30,000, he felt that a 30% deduction from the bill was appropriate. In the second case the Costs Judge had taken an adverse view of the claimants solicitors conduct, which the learned Judge did not consider to have been correct, but in that case he did not feel that he had sufficient information to come to a final decision, and therefore remitted the matter to the Costs Judge for reconsideration in the light of his judgment.

This was a review under RSC Order 62 rule 35. Many years previously, E had suffered abuse when in care. He obtained legal aid to bring a claim for compensation against his local authority and his solicitors wished to instruct an expert who was based in London. He lived in Liverpool. The relevant Legal Aid Board would not give authority to incur the expenses of travelling to London. After challenging the Legal Aid Board decision at various hearings, he obtained legal aid to apply for judicial review of the Legal Aid Board’s refusal. He was successful and an order for costs was made against the Legal Aid Board as well as an order for a legal aid taxation. The main issue in this review related to costs claimed in respect of the judicial review proceedings before legal aid was granted. On taxation (in 1998) the Master disallowed the pre legal aid costs relying on the indemnity principle. The Master held that there was no legal liability on E to pay these costs to the solicitor and, therefore, there were no costs in this period which E could claim from the Legal Aid Board. On 6 April 1999, in the period after taxation but before objections were heard by the Master, E signed a witness statement which stated, amongst other things: ‘My solicitor advised me that I would be personally responsible for the fees involved and whether steps were taken to recover those costs would be a matter of good will on my solicitor’s part. It was never agreed expressly or impliedly that under no circumstances whatsoever would I be responsible for the costs involved or that I would not have to pay any costs. It was, of course, well known to me and my solicitors that my means were extremely limited … However this did not mean that I was not legally responsible for my solicitors costs which were not covered by legal aid.’ References: [2001] EW Costs 8 Judges:

The plaintiffs were trustees of an occupational pension scheme. It began professional negligence proceedings to recover an expected surplus paid to the employer by the solicitors whose advice had been acted on. The anticipated costs were disproportionate, so the case was assigned with the consent of the court to beneficiaries who sued under legal aid. They then applied to the court to be substituted as plaintiffs. Held: The application failed. The trustees had not failed in the performance of their duty to protect the trust estate by declining to continue the action and the applicants had no cause of action against the solicitors since they had no legal or equitable property in the subject-matter of the action. They were simply beneficiaries of any property recovered by the trustees. The trust estate would probably be liable for costs if the action failed and there was nothing in the rules of court to justify handing over the conduct of the action against the third party and accordingly he had no jurisdiction to make the orders sought.

If a court laid a charge of contempt of court, legal aid should normally be granted to the defendant. It was wrong, first to hear representations which led to the charge of contempt being withdrawn, and then to decide that legal aid should not be granted because it was no longer necessary. The effect of this practice would be that legal aid would only be available for sentence for contempt. Contempt is a potentially serious matter and a defendant will generally require representation.

The claimant had successfully challenged the policy of the school as racially discriminatory. He now sought an ancillary order that the respondents should not be allowed to request their costs from the defendant’s appeal whatever the outcome, the Legal Services Commission having withdrawn legal aid. It was argued that the protection sought would remove from the appellant school the protection on costs provided for in the 1999 Act. Held: (Majority) It was essential that there should be representation for both sides before the Court. The case would raise issues of considerable public importance, and it was in the public interest that both sides of the argument should be properly presented. The result of the Commission’s position would be that a legally aided person could not be promised protection against personal liability for costs even if successful at all stages and took no part in an appeal. The LSC must re-instate the legal assistance and pay the costs of the hearing.‘It should be understood, as a principle of general application, that if the Legal Services Commission decide to fund a litigant whether by way of claim or a defence who is successful in his cause, that decision must ordinarily be seen to carry with it something close to an assurance that the Commission will continue to support him in any subsequent appeal by the unsuccessful party whilst he remains financially eligible. This will particularly be so where (a) the withdrawal of support would expose the publicly funded litigant to a substantial risk for future costs, (b) he retains a significant interest, quite apart from his interest in resisting any future costs liability, in maintaining his success in the litigation and (c) the issues raised on the appeal are of general public importance which it is in the public interest to resolve and his case on these issues is unlikely to be properly argued unless he continues to be funded by the Legal Services Commission.’ References: [2009] UKSC 1, Times 17-Oct-2009, [2010] 1 All ER 1, [2009] 1 WLR 2353, [2010] 2 AC 728 Links: Bailii, SC Judges:
