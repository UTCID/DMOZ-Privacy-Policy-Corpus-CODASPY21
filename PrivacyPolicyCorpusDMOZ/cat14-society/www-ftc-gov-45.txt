Public Comments
The FTC requests feedback from the public on proposed rulemakings, regulations, and updates, proposed settlements, modifications of existing orders, workshops, and other agency activities.
Comments from the public help us learn about new technologies and business practices, consider diverse points of view, and improve the quality of our policy-making, law enforcement and education efforts.
You may submit public comments through regulations.gov. If you are unable to submit comments online, you may submit comments in paper form using the instructions for the specific matter you wish to comment upon. Comments are published on the regulations.gov website. Please do not include any sensitive or confidential information.
