This policy may be changed or updated from time to time.
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at office@uufsd.org.
We are available to answer your questions or hear your concerns.
The first principle of Unitarian Universalism is to covenant to affirm and promote the inherent worth and dignity of every person. We believe that this principle impels us to protect the privacy of visitors.
