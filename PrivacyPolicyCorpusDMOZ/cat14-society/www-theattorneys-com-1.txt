What Our Clients Say
Joann is a breath of fresh air. Her wisdom, strength and confidence follow her into the courtroom. My family and I were impressed. She does NOT back down. She hears the client!! She doesn't go about creating her own case (which happens often in family court) She sees the problem and attacks it head on. I hope we don't end up back in this family court system, but if we do, Joann is the one for the job.Denise
