Donate Goods
Give with confidence. Your donation will be put to good use. Thank you!
Your donation of goods frees up financial resources to be used directly in our programs for seriously ill children. Gifts provide the additional resources that Children’s Wish Foundation needs to thrive. Our wish list is below, but we are open to new ideas! Contact us in advance about yours.
Call our office to schedule a drop-off or pick-up. With your donation, include a contact name, address, and description of the goods. We will return a tax receipt to you with our heartfelt thanks.
