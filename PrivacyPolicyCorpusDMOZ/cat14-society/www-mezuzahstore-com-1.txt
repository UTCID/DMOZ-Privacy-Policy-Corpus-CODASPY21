Privacy Policy
Making a purchase at MezuzahStore.com is 100% safe – we guarantee it. When we request personal information from you (such as, name, address, phone number, credit card number) it is done on our secure servers. We use industry standard technology to protect confidential information – SSL (Secured Socket Layer) – an advanced encryption technology that makes personal information unreadable as it travels over the internet.
We realize that customers are concerned about how the information they provide on-line will be used. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will only use the information that we collect to process your order. We will not share your information with any other party.
Spam
MezuzahStore.com is against spam. From time to time we send an email to all of our customers to inform them of special discounts or important information. Every email that we send has a permanent unsubscribe link. If you opt out once, you will never receive email from us again.
Phone Numbers.
In an effort to provide you with superior customer service throughout your transaction, we may require your phone number when registering or completing your sale. Having your phone number will allow us to contact you in case we need to speak to you about your order to correct or complete inaccurate information. We will never use your number to make sales calls and we will never give your number to any other party.
