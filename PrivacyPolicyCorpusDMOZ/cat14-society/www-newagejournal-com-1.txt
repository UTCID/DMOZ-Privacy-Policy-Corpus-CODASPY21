Privacy Policy
The following describes the Privacy Policy for our NewAgeJournal.com website.
Your Privacy
Your privacy is important to us at Cedar Cottage Media. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. You agree to agree to these policies by virtue of using our website in a way that leads to you providing us with personal information.
State Law & Accompanying Rights
Please understand that you may have additional rights originating from State laws based on where you live. These State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow compliment any privacy rights you have inherently or under Federal law. Our policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every jurisdiction in which we operate. Accordingly, you are free to use our Contact information to reach us at any time to assert any State rights.
Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, our website will never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.
Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not allowed to use our website and access our services. It is not our intention to offer products or services to minors.
Collection of Personal Information
When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Other information may be collected as well by Cedar Cottage Media, which is rather typical of most websites. For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally known. Likewise, your duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be tracked. Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you are using to access our website has. Similarly, the type of web browser is often noted. Again, this is common data collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience.
Cookies are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our website. Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the content and experience at NewAgeJournal.com to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on. You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so choose. Please understand that refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some aspects useless to you.
At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it. For instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise. Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve requested.
A prime example of limited access to our website is where some NewAgeJournal.com content may be protected by a username and password. Whether a username and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information related to or connected with you. This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private.
Handling of Personal Information
Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional. As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private” information is now “public,” and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place.
Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so. Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.” However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.
However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base. Further, we may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion.
While we are staunch privacy advocates at Cedar Cottage Media, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our NewAgeJournal.com website. Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website. In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law. On the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect our own interests. For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information.
Google Adsense and the DoubleClick DART Cookie
Google, as a third party advertisement vendor, may use cookies to serve ads on this NewAgeJournal.com website. The use of DART cookies by Google enables them to serve adverts to visitors that are based on their visits to this website, including past visits, as well as other websites on the internet.
To opt out of the DART cookies you may visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the following url http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html Tracking of users through the DART cookie mechanisms are subject to Google’s own privacy policies.
Other Third Party ad servers or ad networks may also use cookies to track users activities on this website to measure advertisement effectiveness and other reasons that will be provided in their own privacy policies, our website has no access or control over these cookies that may be used by third party advertisers. However, you can opt out of some, though likely not all, of these cookies in one easy location at http://ww.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
Links to Third Party Websites
We have included links on this website for your use and reference. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own.
CHANGE NOTICE: As with any of our administrative and legal notice pages, the contents of this page can and will change over time. Accordingly, this page could read differently as of your very next visit. These changes are necessitated, and carried out by Cedar Cottage Media, in order to protect you and our NewAgeJournal.com website. If this page is important to you, you should check back frequently as no other notice of changed content will be provided either before or after the change takes effect.

This material may not be used in any way for any reason and unauthorized use is policed via Copyscape to detect violators.

FTC ComplianceMay 7, 2015Federal Trade Commission Compliance
The following describes the Federal Trade Commission Compliance for our NewAgeJournal.com website.
We make every effort at candor regarding any products or services we use, recommend, or otherwise make mention of at Cedar Cottage Media.  We strive to clearly differentiate between our own products or services versus those of third parties, to facilitate inquiries, support, and customer care.  Likewise, just as we (and any other legitimate business) may profit from the sale of our own products or services, we may also profit from the sale of others’ products or services (like any retailer) at NewAgeJournal.com.  Additionally, wherever products or services may give rise to income generation, we endeavor to provide realistic and factual data, but highlight the fact that the variables impacting results are so numerous and uncontrollable that no guarantees are in any way made.  It is our goal to embrace the guidelines and requirements of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the benefit of all, and with that in mind provide the following disclosures regarding compensation and disclaimer regarding earnings & income.
Note that material connections may not be made known at every single advertisement or affiliate link.  Thus, to be safe, you should simply assume there is a material connection and that we may receive compensation in money or otherwise for anything you purchase as a result of visiting this website, and also that we may be paid merely by you clicking any link.
Amazon.com
One or more parties affiliated or associated with our Cedar Cottage Media website in some way may be an Amazon.com affiliate.  This means that links to products on Amazon.com, as well as reviews leading to purchases, can result in a commission being earned.  Again, disclosure of this material connection and the potential for compensation may not be made at every single possible opportunity.  To be safe, simply assume there is a material connection and potential for compensation at all times.  While this does not imply skewed or unduly biased reviews, full disclosure calls for this warning.
Compensation
You should assume that we may be compensated for purchases of products or services mentioned on this NewAgeJournal.com website that are not created, owned, licensed, or otherwise materially controlled by us. Stated differently, while most people obviously understand that individuals make a living by way of the profit that remains after the costs associated with providing their product or service are covered, at least theoretically there may be someone out there who does not understand that a third party can “affiliate” someone else’s products or services and be compensated by the product or service creator/owner for helping spread the word about their offering. Just compare it to retailers.  They seldom produce anything, but rather make their money connecting product and service creators with end users.
Admonition
Having said that, you cannot count on anyone looking after your interests but you. So, you ought to always do your own research into various offers and opportunities, to the extent that leaves you comfortable, doing your own due diligence prior to making any purchase of any product or service from this NewAgeJournal.com website or any other. Here is a great set of guidelines for you to keep in mind:
First, just always operate from the position that any website proprietor, including us at Cedar Cottage Media, will have a material connection to the product or service provider, and may be compensated as a result of your purchase, unless expressly stated otherwise. Aside from your purchases, note that even you actions could result in earnings for this website.  For instance, there could be ads displayed on this NewAgeJournal.com website that we are compensated for displaying whenever a website visitor clicks on them.
Second, to the extent that we have every interest in positively furthering our business relationship with you, we certainly desire to share only those offerings that we believe will benefit you. Just because we are not the founder or originator of the product or service, we are not going to withhold knowledge of this offering from you. If you can get some benefit from it, regardless of whether or not you’ve taken advantage of our own products and/or services, we want you to do well. Thus, we make a good faith effort to only present to you items that we either personally use, have actually tried, or else have faith in the reputation of the provider or concept. You can count on us making this determination based on all relevant and applicable information at the time of the recommendation.
Third, despite the fact that it would be counterproductive to mention products or services that you’ll find disappointing or inferior, not only are people different, but it’s also possible for us to have a lapse in judgment. Thus, to be extra cautious, even if you believe in our good faith motives, you may as well go ahead and keep in mind that we could be at least partially influenced by the monetization factor of listing various products or services on our NewAgeJournal.com website. Furthermore, in that vein, the reality is that there are sometimes other connections between parties that are not monetary, such as personal capital, goodwill, or otherwise, that could be an underlying undercurrent swaying the decision to promote a particular offering. Due to this hypothetical possibility, you should again simply nor rely solely on what we have to say, but rather just form your own independent opinion just to be safe. Finally, bear in mind that we might also receive free products or services, gifts, or review copies of items too.
Testimonials
Testimonials regarding the outcome or performance of using any product or service are provided to embellish your understanding of the offering.  While great effort is made to ensure that they are factually honest, we at Cedar Cottage Media are not liable for errors and omissions.  Aside from human error, some information may be provided by third parties, such as customers or product/service providers.  The best results are not uncommonly correlated with the best efforts, discipline, diligence, and so on, and thus the results depicted cannot, in any way, be construed as common, typical, expected, normal, or associated with the average user’s experience with any given product or service.  Exceptional results may be depicted by our website as highlights, but you are responsible for understanding that atypical outcomes may not reflect your experience.   Aside from market conditions, products and services change over time.  Older products may lose effectiveness.  Newer products may not have a reliable track record.
Where products or services might pertain to earning money, the same safeguards about use of testimonials apply.  Additionally, note that any related income figures are highly specific to the individual or entity that produced those results, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to leverage the same, or similar, products or services to achieve comparable results.  The results, though real, may be the result of the conflation of a number of favorable circumstances that would be difficult to replicate, and so you must proceed with the knowledge that your outcome can differ from any shared on our website.
Professional Consultation
Many products and services are designed to solve problems.  Common problem areas include legal, financial, and medical.  We are in no way purporting to counsel you on issues related law, finances, or health.  If you require guidance in these arenas, you should consider securing your own counsel from lawyers, accountants, tax professionals, investment advisors, or medical professionals before taking any action.  Nothing we may ever communicate at Cedar Cottage Media, in print or spoken word, will ever be intended to constitute any such counsel, as we do not claim to be professionals in any of those disciplines.  You assume all risk for actions taken, losses incurred, damages sustained, or other issues stemming from your use of any product or service in any way connected with or mentioned on this website.  Indeed, such decision is solely your own, or else determined in conjunction with the professional guidance of the advisor of your choosing.
Use Of Products & Services
The following are facts you should be advised of if you intend to take advantage of any products or services.
The price paid for products and services change over time.  Even the prices of staples and basic commodities change, and there are many factors such as supply and demand, sales and other customer acquisition incentives, and more.  Price, and value, can be quite relative.  Technology, innovations, product improvements, market penetration, and numerous other factors all weigh in.  It is impossible to define the “right” price for any product and service.  Willing buyers and willing sellers determine price at any given time.  You accept the fact that your purchase reflects your own attribution of value at the time of purchase, and that the price may increase or decrease in the future.
The outcome you experience is dependent upon many factors.  Aptitude and attitude go a long way towards success with products and services in virtually any niche, whether fitness or making money.  Circumstances, experience, innate abilities, personality, education, time commitments, and perseverance are just a few factors.  Given the smorgasbord of interrelated variables, there is no way to reasonably predict your specific outcome with any degree of reliability or certainty.
Income-Producing Products & Services
Income-producing products & services are likewise subject to the above cautions.  In addition, however, there are additional factors we like to point out at Cedar Cottage Media.  Unlike weight loss products or self-help materials, income-producing methods are influenced by the overall health of the economy in which one operates.  In times of liquidity, money flows freely and commerce is easier.  In times of perceived scarcity, fear, recession, depression, or otherwise, commerce is stymied.  Results can be influenced by market sentiment, just as the stock market indices around the world are swayed heavily on news.
Income-producing products & services purchased should be viewed as just that – purchases.  Though they can be investments in one’s business, it is not unreasonable to expect that there may not be an express return on that investment, per se.  Often, business success is the convergence of a number of factors, methods, strategies, and so on.  It can be hard to peg success to one method or machination.  This does not necessarily undermine value of any given product or service, as it can have an additive effect.  Or, it may have no effect.  Since it can be difficult to tell, you should operate on the assumption that your outcome could be zero.  We make no guarantees and you should only risk what you can afford to lose on any purchases on or through NewAgeJournal.com.
Earnings & Income
In light of all of the factors above, impinging on the very nature of income-producing products and services, there is no way to guarantee results of any kind whatsoever.  Accordingly, we affirmatively declare that we make no guarantees as to your earnings & income of any kind, at any time.
As with any business endeavor or investment, past performance is no guarantee or predictor of future performance.  Any testimonials or other representations of results are for illustrative purposes only and, though every effort is made to ensure they’re factually honest, they are not intended to imply or insinuate what is likely to happen with you.  Your reliance on them as such is not advised.
It should be noted that “earnings & income” is so phrased with specific intent.  While income may typify the earnings most either seek or are accustomed to, earnings can come in non-monetary forms.  These include some forms that are abstract or intangible, and thus not even readily converted to currency or a common medium of exchange.  Thus, note that all manner of compensation, including earnings of a non-income yet nevertheless beneficial form, are covered by these provisions.
Affiliates & Other Third Parties
It should also be noted that we only have control over, and thus only accept responsibility for, the content of this NewAgeJournal.com website authored by us.  Any representations made by others should be considered prima facie unauthorized.  You may also read, hear, or otherwise come into contact with commentary about any of our products & services or offerings, and should assume those have likewise not been authorized.
While information, in any form, can arise, at any time, regarding our products & services, there may be times when this results from an affiliate relationship.  In other words, we may permit our products & services to be marketed through other individuals, businesses, websites, and otherwise, just as providers of goods and services use retailers and other vendors to make available what they offer.
You should not construe a third-party offer as an endorsement by that third party of any product or service.  You should, more conservatively, view it as an offer to buy something.  Likewise, as alluded to previously, note that we cannot fully control all marketing practices by all parties.  With the use of “mirror” sites, indirect or unauthorized affiliates, “tiered” affiliate structures, and so on, policing the world wide web with any modicum of thoroughness is unlikely.  We make reasonable efforts to ensure our affiliates comply with our policies and represent our products & services consistent with our guidelines.  However, at Cedar Cottage Media we cannot always guarantee they will do so.  You are always free to report concerns or abuses via our Contact information.
Customer Care
Last, but not least, please note that our role in briefing you on products and services other than our own is simply as a “matchmaker.” We do not provide any support or customer service for those items and you should always contact the owner or provider of those products or services to have any and all questions answered to your satisfaction before purchasing.
CHANGE NOTICE: As with any of our administrative and legal notice pages, the contents of this page can and will change over time.  Accordingly, this page could read differently as of your very next visit.  These changes are necessitated, and carried out by Cedar Cottage Media, in order to protect you and our NewAgeJournal.com website.  If this page is important to you, you should check back frequently as no other notice of changed content will be provided either before or after the change takes effect.
COPYRIGHT WARNING: The legal notices and administrative pages on this website, including this one, have been diligently drafted by an attorney.  We at Cedar Cottage Media have paid to license the use of these legal notices and administrative pages on NewAgeJournal.com for your protection and ours.  This material may not be used in any way for any reason and unauthorized use is policed via Copyscape to detect violators.
