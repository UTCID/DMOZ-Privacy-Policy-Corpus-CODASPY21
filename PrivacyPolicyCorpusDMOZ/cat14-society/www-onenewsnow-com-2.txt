Reprinting, Republication, Use in Audio and/or Video Productions
AFN has separate policies for "incidental use" and "recurring use" of our copyrighted material, and special restrictions for use in audio and/or video productions.
The policies stated below regarding AFN material are effective as of August 21, 2007 and may be superceded at any time, without notice, at the sole discretion of AFN management. You are responsible for checking this page to confirm that any use of our copyrighted material conforms to these policies. By using our copyrighted material, you agree to be bound by the terms of these policies.
Incidental Use
Incidental use is defined as one-time, or infrequent and irregular republication or redistribution of news reports for the purpose of informing and/or educating members of a church or denomination, or supporters of some other non-profit organization. For-profit entities do not qualify for incidental use.
Incidental print reproduction of AFN copyrighted material requires that:
The author's (or authors') byline must be included and "OneNewsNow.com" must accompany the byline.
The article must be reprinted in its entirety, unedited, including any "Editor's Note(s)," disclaimer(s), or other annotation(s) that appear(s) at the end of the article.
The statement "Copyright 2010 American Family News Network - Used by permission." must appear at the end of the reprinted article.
Items published in the "Perspectives" section of OneNewsNow.com may not be reprinted, primarily because they are usually written by guest columnists who are not employees of AFN and the permission they have granted AFN to publish their material, usually, does not include redistribution authority. Contact information for most "Perspectives" authors is included at the end of their columns.
Incidental online or email reproduction of AFN copyrighted material requires that:
The author's (or authors') byline must be included and "OneNewsNow.com" must accompany the byline. The reference to "OneNewsNow.com" accompanying the byline must appear as a hyperlink to our home page.
As much as, but no more than the first three paragraphs of the article may be reproduced, and the republished excerpt must be unedited.
The reproduced paragraph(s) must be followed by a text link to the original article at OneNewsNow.com, using the phrases "Read the Full Story" or similar words of identical meaning such as "article" or "story" as the text for the hyperlink. No news item may be referred to as a "column" or "editorial" or any by other word that would reasonably mislead the reader to believe that an AFN news report is an opinion-editorial column.
Opinion-editorial columns - which are published by AFN exclusively in the "Perspectives" section on OneNewsNow.com - may be reproduced according to the above guidelines for incidental online use, except that the reproduced paragraph(s) must be followed by a text link to the original article at OneNewsNow.com, using the phrases "Read the Column" or similar words of identical meaning such as "op-ed" as the hyperlink text. No "Perspectives" item may be referred to as "news" or as a "story," "report," "article," or any by other word that would reasonably lead the reader to believe that an opinion-editorial was published by AFN on OneNewsNow.com as a news item.
Originally-produced, copyrighted news and opinion items published by AFN on OneNewsNow.com may not, under any circumstances, be reproduced in larger part than described above, including reproduction of entire pieces, on other websites. Fair use provisions of U.S. and International Copyright Law allow excerpts for critical review with proper attribution, as described above. Any use in violation of these policies or laws is subject to civil and criminal penalties.
Recurring or Commercial Use
Recurring use is defined as:
Two or more items reproduced within any seven-day period by a publication or website that is updated daily or more often than daily,
Two or more items reproduced within any 31-day period by a publication or website that is updated weekly or more often than weekly but less frequently than daily,
Two or more items reproduced within any 90-day period by a publication or website that is updated monthly or more often than monthly but less frequently than weekly,
Two or more items reproduced within any six-month period by a publication or website that is updated quarterly or more often than quarterly but less frequently than monthly, and/or
Any use by a publication or website that is owned or operated by a for-profit entity or that is funded by advertising or subscription revenue, unless such revenue is paid as Unrelated Business Income to a corporation qualified under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
All requirements for "incidental use" apply to users of AFN material who engage in "recurring or commercial use." In addition, those users who qualify under the definition of "recurring or commercial use" above for print republication are also required to do one of the following:
Place a display ad for OneNewsNow.com at least two (2) columns by one (1) inch in size, using the OneNewsNow.com logo provided by AFN, and containing the text "the One site for your News right Now" in at least 10 point Verdana or similar typeface, in any location on the front page of the publication. The OneNewsNow.com logo must occupy at least eighty (80) percent of the width of the ad.
Place a display ad for OneNewsNow.com at least three (3) columns by two (2) inches in size, using the OneNewsNow.com logo provided by AFN, and containing the text "the One site for your News right Now" in at least 12 point Verdana or similar typeface, in any location on the back page of the publication. The OneNewsNow.com logo must occupy at least eighty (80) percent of the width of the ad.

If the site engaging in recurring or commercial use includes text links to other news websites on its home page, the OneNewsNow.com link must be co-located with those links. The OneNewsNow.com text link may not be displayed in a listing of text or other links for websites that are, in the sole opinion of AFN, "blogs."
Place a button or banner ad - provided by AFN, unedited, and linked to "" - on the home page of the website engaging in the recurring or commercial use, the size of which will depend on the ad's physical placement on the home page:

Comments in Response to Articles
AFN appreciates the desire of our readers, listeners and viewers to comment on the news reports and opinion columns we produce. We remind you, however, that our primary purpose is to publish news and expert commentary from a Christian perspective. OneNewsNow.com is not a blog. If your desire is to participate in a "running discussion" of an issue, please visit The Stand, which is the official blog of our parent organization.
All comments submitted to OneNewsNow.com are reviewed by a moderator before posting. Comments must respond directly to the article about which they are submitted. Comments may not address, refer or respond to other comments.
Comments must be your original writing and may not "cut-and-paste" from the work of others, except for short (less than two sentences) quotations. Comments may not contain profanity, threats, libel, accusations of wrongdoing (moral or legal) against others, copyrighted material, HTML code or hyperlinks, or violate any part of our Acceptable Use Policy (above). Comments may be no more than 300 words (approximately 1,500 characters not including spaces). Comments written in ALL CAPS will not be published.
Comments are reviewed and published Monday through Friday. Comments submitted during weekends will be reviewed the following Monday, as time permits.
Any comment in violation of any part of this policy may be edited or deleted at the sole discretion of the moderators. Comments are chosen for publication at the sole discretion of AFN moderators and we will no longer respond to emails concerning why a particular comment was, or was not, chosen for publication.
TOP
OneNewsNow Polls
Polls posted by OneNewsNow are not scientific, but are provided solely to engage our readers and - like reader comments - allow them to register an opinion about a particular story. Except on weekends, a poll closes roughly 24 hours after it is posted. Final poll results, which remain embedded in the related stories, are used for no other purpose than to allow readers to subsequently view those results.
On occasion, groups and/or individuals may "target" a poll with the objective of skewing the results in their favor. This is known as "freeping" - cheating an online poll by repeatedly voting (usually by clearing cookies or using proxies). OneNewsNow reserves the right to remove or revise any poll that has been targeted. When that happens, it will be so noted and explained at the bottom of the related story.
