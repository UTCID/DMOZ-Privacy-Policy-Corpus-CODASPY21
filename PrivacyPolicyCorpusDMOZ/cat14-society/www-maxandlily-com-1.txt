Samples are available so that you can see finish colors.Wood is unique, variations in grain, color, fit & finish are normal and to be expected. Wood is porous and will expand and contract due to humidity changes in the home. Changes in temperature or humidity can cause joints to open & close and/or wood to warp and crack. Extreme changes may also cause moisture to become trapped under the finish and cause cracking & peeling. As wood expands and contracts it may cause cracking in the joints of painted furniture which is considered normal and unavoidable. Replacement parts are available on a case by case basis.ERRORS & INACCURACIESBest efforts are made to ensure accuracy of information and prices on our website, promotional materials and communications. However, Max & Lily and Maxwood Furniture, Inc. reserve the right to amend any pricing, typographical and/or human or technical errors on our website or materials. Errors discovered in items which have been ordered will be communicated as soon as possible along with the option of reconfirming an order at the correct price or canceling it. If we are unable to contact a customer regarding an error, we will treat the order as canceled.

Dispute Resolution: The following outlines the protocol for any dispute, claim or controversy that mary arise.

This includes disputes arising out of or relating to federal or state statutory claims, common law claims or this Agreement. Also included are disputes over the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the determination of the scope of its applicability. Such disputes, claims or controversy will be, to the full extent permitted by law, determined by arbitration in Charleston, SC before one arbitrator.
The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Maxwood Furniture/Maxtrix®’s principle place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject matter of the dispute.  If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).  The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision.  The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding.  Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial.  This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.
Miscellaneous: You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change this Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, as modified.
