Protecting your privacy is of the utmost importance to the European IP Helpdesk (‘European IP Helpdesk’). The European IP Helpdesk is committed to respecting and protecting your personal data and ensuring your rights as a data subject. All data of a personal nature that identifies you directly or indirectly will be handled fairly, lawfully, and with due care.
This processing operation is subject to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies and on the free movement of such data.

Personal data is not used for any other purposes as outlined above or disclosed to any other recipient nor third countries or international organisations.
5. How does European IP Helpdesk protect and safeguard your information?
European IP Helpdesk takes appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard and protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access.
All personal data related to the implementation of the European IP Helpdesk tasks is stored in secure IT applications according to the European IP Helpdesk quality management and data security standards, as well as in specific electronic folders accessible to authorised recipients only. Appropriate levels of access are granted individually only to the abovementioned authorised recipients.
6. How can you access your personal information and, if necessary, correct it? How can you receive your data? How can you request your personal data to be erased?
You have the right to access, rectify, erase, and receive your personal data, as well as restrict its processing or object to the same, as provided in Articles 17 to 24 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
European IP Helpdesk wants to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date.

To modify or remove your personal information completely from the European IP Helpdesk website and database, please send an email to:
service@iprhelpdesk.eu
Your request will be answered without undue delay, and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.

The European IP Helpdesk will inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.

Personal data will be kept only for the time needed to achieve the purpose for which it is processed.
All data related to the project will be stored for the duration of the project. This is normally five years from the start date of the contract. Information will be shared on the website and in the media.
In the event of a formal appeal, all data held at the time of the appeal will be retained until the completion of the appeal process.
Third-party platforms
Finally, it may be possible that the European IP Helpdesk webpage contains links to other sites whose data processing practices are different from the European IP Helpdesk. Neither the European IP Helpdesk nor EASME or the European Union are responsible for the privacy practices implemented on any of these external sites.

European IP Helpdesk also uses third-party platforms to carry out some of European IP Helpdesk services for you and you can find their privacy policies separately on their website, namely:
