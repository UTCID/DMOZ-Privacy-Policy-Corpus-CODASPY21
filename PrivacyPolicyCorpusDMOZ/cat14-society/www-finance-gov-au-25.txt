Property Services Coordinated Procurement
Property Services Coordinated Procurement
Property Services Coordinated Procurement (PSCP) arrangements were announced in the 2016-17 Budget. The arrangements cover leasing services and facilities management services for Commonwealth domestic office accommodation and shopfronts.
The PSCP arrangements will improve the efficiency of property services across the Commonwealth and maximise the value for money that can be achieved by consolidating the Commonwealth's purchasing power.
There are two parts to the PSCP arrangements:
a Strategic Property Adviser (SPA) to develop and maintain a Whole-of-Australian-Government (WoAG) Leasing Strategy; and
Property Service Providers (PSPs) to deliver leasing services and facilities management services to entities.
In accordance with paragraph 4.10 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs), the PSCP arrangements are mandatory for all non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCEs). Corporate Commonwealth entities (CCEs) may opt in to the arrangements subject to the approval of the Department of Finance (Finance). Entities are encouraged to contact Finance if there are any questions.
Roles and Responsibilities
Strategic Property Adviser
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) is the Strategic Property Adviser (SPA).
The SPA's key role is to develop a WoAG Leasing Strategy that will maximise value for money outcomes from strategic planning of the Commonwealth's leased property. This will be achieved through better-informed purchasing, including with regard to market conditions, and consolidation of the Commonwealth's leased footprint, where practical.
Property Service Providers
PSPs are responsible for providing core leasing services and facilities management services to entities and additional services as negotiated.
There are three PSPs:
Broadspectrum Property Pty Ltd [Work Packages 2 and 5];
Evolve FM Pty Ltd [Work Package 4]; and
Jones Lang LaSalle (ACT) Pty Ltd [Work Packages 1 and 3].
NCEs have been assigned a PSP under a particular Work Package; CCEs will be assigned a PSP if they choose to opt in to the arrangements.
The Department of Finance (Finance)
Finance manages the PSCP arrangements at a WoAG level, in close consultation with entities.
Finance directly manages the SPA in the development, implementation and management of the WoAG Leasing Strategy.
For the PSPs, Finance will monitor performance across each provider's portfolio. This includes:
WoAG-level contract management, such as the negotiation of any new services or amendments to the overarching Deeds;
monitoring key performance metrics at an aggregated level;
formal performance management, including decisions in relation to applying service level rebates and dispute resolution; and
Finance will be the key contact for PSPs, the SPA and entities.
Participating Commonwealth Entities
Commonwealth entities participating in the PSCP arrangements (noting the arrangements are mandatory for NCEs) are responsible for managing their engagement with their PSP and directing the PSP's activities in relation to the entity's property portfolio. Entities' responsibilities in respect of the PSP include:
operational management, including providing detail of the services required, monitoring performance, reporting faults (for reactive maintenance jobs) and approving the annual property operating expenses budget;
paying for the services received through their PSP, as well as rent;
approval and execution (subject to policy requirements) of new leases; and
providing feedback to Finance on their PSP's performance.
Services
The PSPs are responsible for the delivery of core (mandatory) leasing services and facilities management services and a range of related additional (non-mandatory) services to entities.
The core services are:
leasing services, including: lease planning; lease transactions; lease management; and management of Green Lease Schedules;
facilities management services, including: facilities management planning; provision of building services such as cleaning; repairs and maintenance; provision of a help desk; and
services that are ancillary to the leasing and facilities management services, including reporting and financial management.
The PSPs will also provide entities' data directly to Finance for Australian Government Property Register reporting.
The PSPs are able to provide a range of non-mandatory services, known as the additional services, to entities through the PSCP arrangements. As these services are non-exclusive, entities may purchase these services from any PSP or through providers that are not part of the PSCP arrangements.
Under the PSCP arrangements there are two categories of additional services:
Additional Ongoing Services: services that are typically provided on an ongoing basis such as management of sub-tenants (known as Lease (Landlord) Services), provision of spatial management software systems or the provision of an onsite facilities manager; and
Additional Transactional Services: services that are provided for a specific timeframe or project, such as management of a specific capital works project, managing a major relocation or undertaking a heritage assessment.
While the list and description of services that are available to each entity are the same, there is flexibility in how the services are delivered to entities to accommodate particular operational requirements.
Further information about the services is available on request from PSCP@finance.gov.au.
Transition
The timing for entity transitions to the PSCP arrangements will be staggered. In general, NCEs will transition to the PSCP arrangements when their existing service provider contract expires or when they need to undertake a property-related procurement, for example a service contract or new lease.
PSPs will provide an integrated, coordinated and cooperative approach to transition for each entity, and will work closely with any outgoing service providers.
As entities transition to the PSCP arrangements there are a number of transition-in services that are performed during the transition-in period. These services establish the systems and frameworks for the provision of the core leasing and facilities management services under the PSCP arrangements. The length of the transition-in period will vary depending on the complexity of each NCE's property portfolio.
Process
Each PSP will develop an indicative transition timetable for its assigned entities. This schedule may be adjusted, for example, where an urgent need arises or an NCE transitions early.
In order to commence transition, entities will need to complete an Entity Details Notice, which is similar to a work order and provides basic information to the PSP about the entity's property portfolio. There is an Entity Details Notice template for each PSP:
Broadspectrum Property Pty Ltd [DOC 41KB]
Evolve FM Pty Ltd [DOC 41KB]
Jones Lang LaSalle (ACT) Pty Ltd [DOC 54KB]
The relevant PSP will develop an Entity Transition-In Plan for each entity, which will include details of key personnel and other resources, systems development requirements, reporting, risk analysis and an outline of the approach to the Transition-In Services.
During transition-in, the PSP will work closely with the entity to ensure smooth implementation of services. In this process entities will need to provide its PSP with relevant documentation, such as leases and list of subcontractors, and discuss with the PSP entity specific requirements that will need to be considered as part of service delivery and systems/process development.
AusTender Reporting
Entities will need to report procurements valued at or above the reporting threshold conducted through the PSCP arrangements on AusTender in accordance with the CPRs. This guidance seeks to ensure that contracts are reflected accurately.
It is critical that all entities use the correct Standing Offer Notice (SON) and Australian Business Number (ABN) when reporting under the PSCP arrangements. Finance has established a SON on AusTender.
The relevant details are as follows:
PSCP Arrangements SON ID
SON3460620
PSP
ABN
Broadspectrum Property Pty Ltd
16 618 028 676
Jones Lang LaSalle (ACT) Pty Ltd
69 008 585 260
Evolve FM Pty Ltd
52 605 472 580
As the PSCP arrangements were established through an open tender process, entities should report all services procured through the PSCP arrangements as an 'open tender' and ensure it is linked to the SON.
Property-Related Reporting
The elements of the PSCP arrangements are to be reported in accordance with AusTender reporting requirements.
Property RelatedReporting Component
Reporting Timeframe
Update
How to Report
PSCP Core Services Management Fee
Once an Entity has transitioned to the PSCP arrangements
Annually
Entities will need to:
create a Contract Notice (CN) linked to SON3460620
value the CN based on total Management Fees the Entity expect to pay to the PSP from when the Entity enters the Arrangement until the end of the initial term of the Deed (30 June 2021).
Property Operating Expenses (pass through costs)
Once an Entity has transitioned to the PSCP arrangements
Annually at the very minimum
Entities are required to report on commitments for the period of the arrangement and have this adjusted annually. PSCP arrangement will follow Model B of reporting pass through costs in accordance with AusTender Reporting Requirements.
provide an estimate (not-to-exceed amount) and approve the maximum value of the POE which the PSPs will work to, aligned with entity's POE annual budget for the period of the Arrangement.
the estimate is to be reported under the Core Services Management Fee CN.
rental expenses must not be included in the annual POE estimates.
cost estimates may vary from time to time. Should this occur, entities must update the relevant CN in accordance with standard reporting requirements under the CPRs.
PSCP Additional Services
On a case-by-case basis, if and when these services are accessed
As required
Only applies to additional services purchased from a PSP under the PSCP arrangements. Entities will need to:
create a CN linked to SON3460620 for the total value of additional ongoing services and additional transactional services commitments, excluding major works.
for major works, such as major capital works project, a separate CN is to be created.
Leases
As lease transaction occurs
As required
Under the PSCP arrangements, entities will continue to report leases on AusTender in accordance with the standard processes.
Confidentiality – at the WoAG level this is specified in the SON. Entities should only flag confidential information if it forms part of the Entity Details Notice (EDN) or Work Order.
