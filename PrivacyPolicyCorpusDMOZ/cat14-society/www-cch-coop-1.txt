3 days ago CCH Annual Conference 2020:
It is with great regret that we are not going to be able to go ahead with our rescheduled Annual conference at the Mercure Haydock Park in December.
The team at CCH have been closely and continuously monitoring the COVID19 situation as it has developed both globally and in the UK, and we are still not in a situation where we can risk going ahead with a large gathering.
Current restrictions are unlikely to change and many areas are in local lockdown, including that of the conference hotel itself.We are now looking at dates in the middle of next year at the same hotel and we will send out the new dates as soon as possible.
