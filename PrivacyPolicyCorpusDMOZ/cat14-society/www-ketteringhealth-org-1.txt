Notice of Privacy Practices
This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed.
Please review it carefully.
The terms of this Notice of Privacy Practices apply to the Kettering Health Network, operating as a clinically integrated health care arrangement composed of our hospitals, Kettering Medical Center, Grandview Medical Center, Southview Medical Center, Sycamore Medical Center, Soin Medical Center, Greene Memorial Hospital, Fort Hamilton Hospital, and Kettering Behavioral Medical Center, as well as our clinics and health centers, physicians and other licensed professionals seeing and treating patients at each service location. A complete listing of our service locations is available upon request. The members of this clinically integrated health care arrangement work and practice at some or all of the service locations. The members of this clinically integrated health care arrangement will share personal health information of patients as necessary to carry out treatment, receive payment, and health care operations as permitted by law.
We are required by law to maintain the privacy of our patients' personal health information and to provide patients with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your personal health information. We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice so long as it remains in effect. We reserve the right to change the terms of the Notice of Privacy Practices as necessary and to make the new Notice effective for all personal health information maintained by us. You may receive a copy of any revised notices at any service location or a copy may be obtained on the web at ketteringhealth.org or by mailing a request to the Kettering Health Network Privacy Officer.
USES AND DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION
Your Authorization: Except as outlined below, we will not use or disclose your personal health information for any purpose unless you have signed a form authorizing the use or disclosure. You have the right to revoke that authorization in writing unless we have taken any action in reliance on the authorization. There will be certain uses and disclosures of your personal health information for which we will always obtain a prior authorization and these include:
Marketing Communications: Unless the communication is made directly to you in person, is simply a promotional gift of nominal value, is a prescription refill reminder, general health or wellness information, or a communication about health related products or services that we offer or that are directly related to your treatment.
Most Sales of your personal health information unless for treatment or payment purposes or as required by law.
Psychotherapy Notes: Unless otherwise permitted or required by law.
Uses and Disclosures for Treatment: We will make uses and disclosures of your personal health information as necessary for your treatment. For instance, doctors and nurses and other professionals involved in your care will use information in your medical record and information that you provide about your symptoms and reactions to plan a course of treatment for you that may include procedures, medications, test, etc. We may also release your personal health information to another health care facility or professional who is not affiliated with our organization but who is or will be providing treatment to you. For instance, if after you leave the hospital, you are going to receive home health care, we may release your personal health information to that home health care agency so that a plan of care can be prepared for you.
Uses and Disclosures for Payment: We will make uses and disclosures of your personal health information as necessary for the payment purposes of those health professionals and facilities that have treated you or provided services to you. For instance, we may forward information regarding your medical procedures and treatment to your insurance company to arrange payment for the services provided to you or we may use your information to prepare a bill to send to you or to the person responsible for your payment.
Uses and Disclosures for Health Care Operations: We will use and disclose your personal health information as necessary, and as permitted by law, for our health care operations which include clinical improvement, professional peer review, business management, accreditation and licensing, etc. For instance, we may use and disclose your personal health information for purposes of improving the clinical treatment and care of our patients. We may also disclose your personal health information to another health care facility, health care professional, or health plan for such things as quality assurance and case management, but only if that facility, professional, or plan also has or had a patient relationship with you.
Our Facility Directory: We maintain a facility directory listing the name, room number, and, if you wish, your religious affiliation. Unless you choose to have your information excluded from this directory, the information, excluding your religious affiliation, will be disclosed to anyone who requests it by asking for you by name. This information, including your religious affiliation, may also be provided to members of the clergy. You have the right during registration to have your information excluded from this directory and also to restrict what information is provided and/or to whom.
Family and Friends Involved In Your Care: With your approval, we may from time to time disclose your personal health information to designated family, friends, and others who are involved in your care or in payment of your care in order to facilitate that person's involvement in caring for you or paying for your care. If you are unavailable, incapacitated, or facing an emergency medical situation and we determine that a limited disclosure may be in your best interest, we may share limited personal health information with such individual's without your approval. We may also disclose limited personal health information to a public or private entity that is authorized to assist in disaster relief efforts in order for that entity to locate a family member or other persons that may be involved in some aspect of caring for you.
Business Associates: Certain aspects and components of our services are performed through contracts with outside persons or organizations, such as auditing, accreditation, legal services, etc. At times it may be necessary for us to provide certain of your personal health information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to appropriately safeguard the privacy of your information.
Fundraising: We may contact you to donate to a fundraising effort for or on our behalf. You have the right to "opt-out" of receiving fundraising materials/communications and may do so by sending your name and address to the Privacy Officer together with a statement that you do not wish to receive fundraising materials or communications from us.
Health Information Exchanges: We participate in one or more Health Information Exchanges. Your healthcare providers can use this electronic network to securely provide access to your health records for a better picture of your health needs. We and other healthcare providers, may allow access to your health information through the Health Information Exchange for treatment, payment or other healthcare operations. This is a voluntary agreement. You may opt-out at any time by notifying the Kettering Health Network Information Management Services/Medical Records Department.

You have the right to request and we will accommodate reasonable requests by you to receive communications regarding your personal health information from us by alternative means or at alternative locations. You may request such confidential communications in writing and may send your request to the Privacy Officer.
Health Products and Services: We may from time to time use your personal health information to communicate with you about health products and services necessary for your treatment, to advise you of new products and services we offer, and to provide general health and wellness information.
Research: In limited circumstances, we may use and disclose your personal health information for research purposes. For example, a researcher may wish to compare outcomes of all patients that received a particular drug and will need to review a series of medical records. In all cases where your specific authorization is not obtained, your privacy will be protected by strict confidentiality requirements applied by an Institutional Review Board or Privacy Board which oversees the research or by representations of the researchers that limit their use and disclosure of patient information.
Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records: The confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records maintained by this facility is protected by federal law and regulations.

If you are a member of the military as required by armed force services; we may also release your personal health information if necessary for national security or intelligence activities; and
