Home > About Us
Privacy is your right and our duty. We respect your concern for privacy, and we follow this privacy policy.
1. Your Acceptance of these Terms and Conditions and National Partnership’s Policies
Thank you for visiting the nationalpartnership.org website and/or any of the several other websites operated by the National Partnership for Women & Families (“National Partnership”). (All of the websites operated by the National Partnership shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Website.”) By using and/or visiting the Website, you agree to these Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. If you do not agree to any of these terms, please do not use the Website.
2. The Website
National Partnership hereby grants you permission to use the Website, provided that you use the Website solely for your personal, noncommercial use and in complete compliance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. National Partnership hereby grants you permission to make one copy of any part of the Website in any medium to use for your personal, noncommercial use, but you must obtain National Partnership’s prior consent to make additional copies, to distribute any copies or to publicly display any of the information provided on the Website.
3. Restrictions on Use
You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, robots, spiders or offline readers, that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to National Partnership’s servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, National Partnership grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials. National Partnership reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information from the Website, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Website for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit any users of the Website for any commercial purposes.

National Partnership has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. By using the Website, you expressly relieve National Partnership from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website. Accordingly, National Partnership encourages you to be aware when you leave the Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.
5. Intellectual Property Rights

National Partnership collects different kinds of information about the users to the Website:
User Provided Information: You may provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) to National Partnership when choosing to participate in various activities on the Website, such as joining an issue campaign, subscribing to one of our mailing lists, making a donation, or submitting content through our blog or other interactive portion of our Website. (Please note that you may choose not to provide personally identifiable information through the Website, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services or functionality to you.)
Cookies Information: When you visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Website may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Log File Information: When you use the Website, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. If your personal information changes (such as your email address), or if you wish to have your information removed from our database, contact us and we will correct, update or remove that personal data provided to us.
7. The Way National Partnership Uses the Information It Collects
If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Website, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Website. In addition, we may add you to our mailing lists (email or otherwise) and send you emails or other communications about our work and/or the issues that are important to us.
If you submit content for posting on the Website through our blog or any other interactive feature of the Website, we may post or publicly disclose any personal information that is contained within such content. For example, if you submit a story about your personal experiences for posting on the Website, we have the right to post the personal information that you include in your story. We may also identify you, your hometown and your age in connection with your posting, unless you instruct us otherwise at the time of submission. For example, we may identify the person who posted a particular story as Joseph Smith, age 49, from Trenton, New Jersey, unless you instruct us at the time you submit your content that you do not want to be identified by all this information. You may instead ask that we identify you as Joseph S., age 49, from Trenton, New Jersey, or J. Smith, age 49, or J. Smith from Trenton, or even only Joe from New Jersey. In addition, if you submit a photograph in connection with your posting, you represent that you have the right to submit the photograph to us and that we can use the photograph in connection with your submission.
We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.
We use cookies and log file information to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to monitor aggregate metrics, such as total number of visitors, and pages viewed, and to track your entries and submissions.
8. When National Partnership Discloses Information
We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with third parties without your consent.
We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Website.
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
National Partnership also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that National Partnership believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce the terms and conditions set forth herein, to take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of National Partnership, our users or others.

You agree not to post anything to the Website that is defamatory, constitutes an invasion of privacy or publicity, violates the intellectual property rights of any third party, or is otherwise unlawful.

We will honor your request if it is stated clearly and sent to us with your submission.)
