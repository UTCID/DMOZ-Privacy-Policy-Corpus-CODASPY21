Read on to find out how we handle personal data.
Scope of applicability
The present privacy policy applies to all processing operations concerning personal information supplied by donors and relations (hereinafter: ‘Personal Data’) and data acquired from individuals’ visits to and use of Global March’s websites.
By participating in one of our campaigns or becoming a donor, supporter or partner, you accept this privacy policy and give your consent to Global March to collect and store your data and process them in the manners described in the present policy.
Data processing
Global March Against Child Labour processes Personal Data for its supporter and donor records, for its awareness raising and fundraising programmes and for providing information about our work and campaigns.
Global March ensures that the systems in which Personal Data are stored have appropriate organisational and technical security. This serves to ensure that Personal Data is accessible only by employees whose jobs carry the necessary authorisation and that we use the Personal Data only for the purposes for which they were acquired and for compatible purposes. In so far as Global March Against Child Labour engages service providers to assist with recordkeeping, fundraising or providing information, the use of the data and the security measures implemented by those parties are recorded in data processing agreements.
Your data will not be disclosed to other third parties without your explicit consent, except where it is required by law to disclose those data.
In connection with tax laws, the retention period for our donor records is 7 years. Data from newsletter subscribers are removed as soon as the individual unsubscribes.
Data collected through the Internet
Global March Against Child Labour collects Personal Data through its websites. This happens when a visitor subscribes to one of our email newsletters, participates in an online campaign or signs up as a donor.
Data collected through sources other than the Internet
