With nearly every company being vulnerable to data security breaches, distributed denial of service (DDoS) and other cyber-attacks, KJK’s Cybersecurity, Data Breach & Privacy attorneys assist in identifying and addressing  information security risks for our clients.Cyber incidents are growing in frequency and severity and regulators around the world have implemented changes in laws or regulations to address these heightened risks.  There is an evolving body of laws and regulations that relate to the collection, storage, protection and use of electronic data (“CyberLaw”). For example the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance on CyberSecurity disclosures under the federal securities laws and advised that companies “should review, on an ongoing basis, the adequacy of their disclosure relating to CyberSecurity risks and cyber incidents” and that appropriate disclosures may include, a “[d]escription of relevant insurance coverage.” Amidst increased exposure to such risks, companies need assistance in handling security breaches and preventing future CyberSecurity threats.KJK’s Cybersecurity, Data Breach & Privacy attorneys can perform a preliminary assessment with our clients to identify their potential legal exposure by drafting internal policies and procedures and contractual provisions regarding discovery, investigation, remediation and reporting of breaches.Our Cybersecurity, Data Breach & Privacy team can assists clients with:Performing a global review of internet privacy and cyber security issues that specifically relate to your businessReviewing your existing response plans and procedures in respect of how you would handle a data breach or assist you in implementing a response planAssessing your existing privacy policy on any corporate websites or drafting a privacy policy that meets your needs and complies with laws and best practices concerning policies on the collection and use of personally identifiable informationReviewing your standard terms and conditions of sale or purchase with respect to warranties and indemnification that may, in part, protect you from CyberLaw risksReviewing your payment and procurement policies and procedures for CyberLaw risksAssisting with respect to electronic discovery in the context of litigationLitigating data security breach actions
