MITRE Establishes Center for Data-Driven Policy
New, nonpartisan center develops actionable, measurable policy solutions
Print
McLean, Va., and Bedford, Mass., September 22, 2020—MITRE has established the Center for Data-Driven Policy to bring evidence-based, objective, nonpartisan insights to government policymaking.
Through public-private partnerships and the operation of federally funded R&D centers, MITRE tackles challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation. The Center for Data-Driven Policy will draw upon MITRE's deep technical expertise, and our own labs and independent research programs, to provide innovative, tangible, and measurable ideas to inform public policy.
"Our team of experts will take what MITRE has learned through research and experimentation and apply those insights to help guide policymakers," said Dave Powner, director of strategic engagement and partnerships at MITRE, and executive director of the new center. "Like MITRE, the Center for Data-Driven Policy doesn't lobby or take political positions. Our goal is to broaden and strengthen an evidence-based approach to policy decisions."
The center will collaborate with government, industry, universities, think tanks, and other non-profit organizations to develop policy that is actionable and consequential, based on solid data and rigorous modeling and simulation.
"MITRE's mission is to solve problems for a safer world, and that goes beyond working at a technical or program level," says Jason Providakes, MITRE president and CEO. "We want to expand the role of out-come based research and information in the policy domain, through our experience, our technology, and our unique access to data."
“The challenges we face as a nation are significant and urgent. Policymakers need to move fast and deliver results,” says Jim Cook, MITRE'S vice president for strategic engagement and partnerships. “The center will work with partner organizations, collaborating on research papers, events and workshops, with the objective of advancing policy solutions that are effective, equitable and impactful."
In the coming weeks, the Center for Data-Driven Policy is releasing its first set of white papers on the following topics:
Framework for Developing and Implementing Data-Driven, Actionable Policy
Delivering Mission Outcomes Through Digital Transformation: Ways to Accelerate Technology Modernization
Actionable Ethics for Fairness in AI
Strengthening Our Resilience to Environmental Change Is a National Security Imperative
Will We Be Ready for our Next Crisis? The Science and Art of Models–Practical Information for Data-Driven Decisions
Achieving Transformational Customer Experience
Additional papers addressing a wide range of national priorities will be published on a regular basis.
About MITRE
MITRE’s mission-driven teams are dedicated to solving problems for a safer world. Through our public-private partnerships and federally funded R&D centers, we work across government and in partnership with industry to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.
