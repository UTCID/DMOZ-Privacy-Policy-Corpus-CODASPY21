Privacy Policy
This page explains our approach to privacy and how it affects you.
We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.
Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. We can't control them but we don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.
If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we'll never share it with others without your express permission.
We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.
For more information on how we comply with our obligations under the "GDPR", please read our Data Privacy Notice.
Measuring our visitors
We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your device. All of that information is anonymous – so we don't know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.
The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.
