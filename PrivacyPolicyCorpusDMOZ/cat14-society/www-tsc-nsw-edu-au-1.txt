What others are saying
"My experience at Scots has been about making connections with my mates and their families; not just going to a school to memorise text books and win awards. Scots is a place with rich opportunities; here I have discovered who I am and how I can best help the community."
Joshua Stevens, Year 12 (2016)
"Being a Scots boy means having a sense of pride and integrity. Being Head Prefect will be the most memorable experience of my time at Scots, because it gave me a chance to leave a positive mark on the College that has been such a big part of my life."
Harry Foxton, Class of 2011
"Being a Scots boarder has given me the opportunity to experience the wide variety of cultures that are a part of the Scots community. Boarding has also developed in me a strong sense of independence and I leave Scots with the knowledge that I can overcome any challenge I encounter in the future."
Kyol Blakeney, Class of 2011
"When I arrived in Australia I was concerned that my English wasn't strong. Being a part of the Scots community, I was encouraged to get involved and as a result I became more confident in speaking the (English) language. I now have the confidence to be the man that I want to be."
David Lin, Class of 2011
"Attending the same College as my father (Graham Bursill, '59) has enriched the bond between us. The world today demands that people have the ability to adapt to new challenges. The College offers a wealth of experiences that are invaluable in meeting these challenges."
Jackson Bursill, Class of 2011
"I have been very thankful to attend such a wonderful school. Scots has given me a greater appreciation of what I have. Scots is in a prime location (can't get any better), provides Glengarry, which is amazing and I have been able to board with so many students from different walks of life. I've loved it!"
Henry Lavender, Year 12 (2015), Fairfax Boarder
"What I love about the learning program at Scots is that it is tailored just for you!"
Daniel Bullock, Year 6 (2015)
"What I love about Scots is the depth and breadth of opportunity. Somewhere in the great range of subjects, co-curricular and sport activities provided... there is a place here for everyone."
Mr Richard Blackett, Housemaster, Latin, Ancient History, 50 years of service
