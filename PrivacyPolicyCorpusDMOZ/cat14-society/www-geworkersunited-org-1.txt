Privacy Policy
Effective Oct 1, 2014
IUE-CWA respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how IUE-CWA uses the personal information we collect through the GE Workers United website (the “Website”).  By using or accessing the Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through the Website and does not describe the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any means other than our Website. IUE-CWA may modify this policy from time to time so we encourage you to check this page when revisiting this website. The type and amount of information received depends on how you use the site.
Website Usage/Information Collection
When you visit the Website, we automatically obtain information from you about the name of your Internet service provider, the browser and type of computer you are using, the website that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests. We use this information on an aggregate basis to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors. For example, we use this information to track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole.  We may record information about your usage of the Website, such as when you use the site, the areas of the site you click on and/or participate in, the tags you search for, and whether or not you subscribe to the RSS feed. If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. A persistent cookie may be used to track this information. We may use pixel tags and/or trackable links in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and/or clicked on by recipients.  We do not collect or store personally identifiable information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address or phone number, unless you provide that information.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
IUE-CWA provides web forms so you may provide your contact information to engage in IUE-CWA activities such as online activism (i.e., contact Congress), to place orders for products or services or to correspond with IUE-CWA. Any information we collect, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, type of request you are making and any additional information you provide, is collected and stored by IUE-CWA. The information is used to fulfill your request, to engage you and your co-workers in advocacy and activism, and track aggregate information about usage of these features. IUE-CWA makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission of your sensitive information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies, such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
SPECIAL NOTICE FOR PARENTS
IUE-CWA does not knowingly collect, use or distribute children’s personally identifiable information to any third parties. We want to help you guard your children’s privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet. When using our apps or websites, please do not enter names, ages, or other personal information of individuals under age 14. If you have any reservations, questions or concerns about your child’s access to this site or how information that your child provides is used by us, please contact us.
IUE-CWA’s Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information
IUE-CWA may share personal information you give us with other labor organizations if we believe you would be interested in receiving communications from these organizations, for example, the AFL-CIO, Union Privilege, or a Local Union, as well as third parties that perform services on our behalf. These third party providers are committed to protecting the privacy of our members and subscribers, and will not utilize your information for any other purpose but to provide the services which we contract for.
The Website will not post your personal contact information, including e-mail address, street address and phone numbers, without your consent. Without such consent, website staff will withhold posting personal contact information for that individual.
Financial Information and Payments
We use a secure server for processing payments and financial information.. IUE-CWA staff retrieves the encrypted information from the secure site and transmits it to the bank via the software that the bank provides for this purpose. IUE-CWA does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. The Website uses a cookie for measuring aggregate web statistics, including number of monthly visitors, number of repeat visitors, most popular Web pages and other information. IUE-CWA will also use cookies to facilitate your online visit by maintaining data that you provide for online activism activities so that you will not need to resubmit certain information.
Geolocation Data
If you choose to provide location data via a location-based service feature on our website, we may collect and use location data as you provide, or as sent from your device, to provide and improve location-based products and services.
Opting Out of E-mail Lists
People who subscribe to e-mail lists via the website will receive periodic updates from IUE-CWA by regular mail, fax or e-mail. You may opt out of receiving future information via e-mail by using the unsubscribe procedure specified on the e-mail message.
Outside Links
This site contains hypertext links to other sites. IUE-CWA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site, and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.
Security
IUE-CWA takes security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
If you send us an e-mail, you should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. So, if your communication includes sensitive information like your bank account, charge card, or social security number, and you prefer not to use one of our secure online complaint forms, contact us by mail or by telephone rather than by e-mail.
Corrections/Updating Personal Information
If your personal information changes (such as your ZIP code), or if you wish to have your information removed from our database, contact us and we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that personal data provided to us.

Miscellaneous
This User Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of Washington, D.C., without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
