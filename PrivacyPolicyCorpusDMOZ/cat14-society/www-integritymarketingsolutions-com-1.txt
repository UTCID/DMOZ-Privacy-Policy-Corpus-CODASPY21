Google Analytics is a resource used to gather pieces of information about the traffic to this website. These pieces of information can tell a website owner how visitors move through the site. Website owners then use this data to make improvements to their website to increase a visitor’s positive experience.
This information is collected anonymously. Using Google Analytics, first-party cookies collect visitor data, such internet protocol (IP) addresses, browsers and operating systems; however, does not identify any individual. This process occurs because cookies automatically send a file to a computer’s hard drive that stores data, like the time of day a visitor came to this site, first-time or repeat visitors and what website the visitor was on just prior to reaching this site. A website owner can review this data in reports that inform the owner if the website is performing at an optimal level or if updates need to be made.
If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics, you may do so without interrupting how you are able to view this website.
