Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. We will not share your information with 3rd parties, unless if it's required in order to fulfill your order or if we're required to do so by law.
Shipping Policy
Order for custom items (i.e. customer benchers, customer yarmulkes) takes 2-3 weeks to process. Then we will ship it via your selected shipping method (i.e. UPS Ground, UPS 2-Day). If the order contains no custom products, then it usually ships within 1 business day.
Return Policy
Personalized items (such as Kippot & Benchers) can not be returned nor exchanged. All other items can be returned within 30 days for a full refund (excluding shipping cost). Contact us via email or by phone to receive authorization prior to returning merchandise.
All claims for errors or damages must be reported within five days of receipt of merchandise. We will not take responsibility for additional air shipping or rush charges if the error was not reported immediately. After defective merchandise is returned to us, we will send a replacement order or issue a refund. No returns allowed on personalized merchandise.
Store Pickup Policy
We offer free store pickup. If you selected store pickup during checkout, please wait for a confirmation that your order is ready for pickup. Please note: store pickup orders must pay NYS sales tax. If for any reason your order was not charged tax, you must pay it at the time of pickup.
