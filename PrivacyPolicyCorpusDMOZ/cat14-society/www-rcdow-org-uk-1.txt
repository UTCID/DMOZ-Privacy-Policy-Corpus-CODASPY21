1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Diocese of Westminster (the "Diocese") is a charity registered with the Charity Commission in England and Wales. Our charity number is 233699 and our registered address is Archbishop's House Ambrosden Avenue London SW1P 1QJ. In this Notice, references to 'we' and 'us' mean the Diocese.
1.2 When you provide us with Personal Data in order to engage with us and/or benefit from our activities, we will keep a record of the data you give to us in order to enable us to comply with our statutory obligations and to achieve our charitable objects of advancing and maintaining the Roman Catholic religion through the operation of our parishes and our other activities.
1.3 For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/279 (GDPR), the Diocese through its Trustees will be a Data Controller in respect of your Personal Data. In some cases, the Diocese may be a joint Data Controller of your Personal Data (e.g. where your data is shared between the Diocese and another organisation for a particular purpose). Please be aware that our parishes form part of the Diocese and are not separate legal entities. Parishes are not Data Controllers nor do they process Personal Data on behalf of the Diocese as a Data Processor.
1.4 Everyone has rights with regard to how their Personal Data is handled by organisations. The Diocese is committed to ensuring that Personal Data is properly and securely managed in accordance with the relevant data protection laws, and believes this is an important part of achieving trust and confidence between the Diocese and those with whom it interacts. Please read this Notice to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or that we obtain or hold about you, and to understand what your rights are in relation to information that we hold. This Notice applies to information about living identifiable individuals only.
2. WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE HOLD ABOUT YOU?
2.1 We may hold the following types of Personal Data:

2.1.10 any other information which you choose to provide to us or that we are provided by others.
2.2 We may also hold Special Categories of Personal Data e.g. information about your religious beliefs, information about your health and wellbeing, information revealing racial or ethnic origins, information concerning your sexual orientation or in the case of background checks, information about criminal records or proceedings.
2.3 We may also receive Personal Data about you from third parties, for example, your family members, other parishioners, our schools, other dioceses, medical professionals, the police and other law enforcement bodies.
3. HOW AND WHY DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
3.1 The Personal Data which we hold about you, whether it is collected directly from you or whether we receive it from a third party, may be Processed in a number of ways, for example:
3.1.1 to communicate with you in relation to news about or activities and events taking place in the Diocese or in any Diocesan parish, including seeking feedback and informing you of any changes to our activities;
3.1.2 to improve our activities and the way we communicate with you including our website or the website of any parish;
3.1.3 to carry out our activities, from weddings and funerals to general pastoral and spiritual care;
3.1.4 to process donations that you may make to us or other payments where, for example, you hire facilities belonging to the Diocese;

3.1.7 to help us to improve our fundraising and find potential sources of additional funds, by gathering information about our supporters and potential supporters, either information that they have shared themselves or that is publicly available from sources such as for example, Companies House, the Electoral Register, company websites, published information, social networks such as LinkedIn, political and property registers, and news archives, which we use to help tailor our messages and requests. Through building relationships with supporters, we understand their ‘vocation’ in giving, i.e. which aspects of our work, if any, they feel called to support; this makes our fundraising as effective and efficient as possible, which is something supporters tell us is very important to them. Supporters can ask us not to use their data in this way by emailing supportercare@rcdow.org.uk or by calling 020 7798 9025;
3.1.8 for audit and statistical purposes (e.g. for the annual audit undertaken by the Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales);

3.1.11 to live stream Masses and other church celebrations to assist those who cannot attend. These may be viewed via the internet anywhere in the world.
3.2 Any information gathered through cookies and similar technologies via the Diocesan website or the website of any parish, is used to measure and analyse information on visits to the website, to tailor the website to make it better for visitors and to improve technical performance.

12. GLOSSARY
"Data Controller" means a person, organisation or body that determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any Personal Data is processed. A Data Controller is responsible for complying with the data protection laws including the GDPR and establishing practices and policies in line with them.
"Data Processor" means any person, organisation or body that Processes personal data on behalf of and on the instruction of the Diocese. Data Processors have a duty to protect the information they process by following data protection laws.
