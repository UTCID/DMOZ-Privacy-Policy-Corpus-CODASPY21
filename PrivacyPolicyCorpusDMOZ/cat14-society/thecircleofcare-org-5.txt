Join Our Circle
Help us to continue our mission by joining one of our committees. Joining a committee is typically less of a time commitment than a Board position, but offers an opportunity to directly impact the work we do. We are always looking for individuals to help in the following areas:
Marketing
Help raise awareness! Web copy, social media posts, press relations and all other forms of communications are created by this committee
Special Events
Creative, organized, and like to have fun? This is the committee for you - help organize fundraisers throughout the state
Resource Development
Analytical and task driven? This committee led by our Executive Director is focused on grant-writing and corporate partnerships
Program/Services
Do you have experience in the pediatric healthcare world? This committee evaluates and manages on-going patient programs as well as developing new ones
Contact us for more information
Volunteers are the driving force of Circle of Care. Our Art From the Heart room makeover teams are composed of a range of individuals, from hardworking high school students to gifted designers. Other volunteers span from tireless fundraisers to specially-trained hospital companions. Our volunteers are diverse in their skills, but share one common passion-- making a difference in the lives of kids with cancer.
