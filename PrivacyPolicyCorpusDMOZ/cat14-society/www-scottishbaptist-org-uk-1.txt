Connecting Baptist churches in mission
The Baptist Union of Scotland is a network of about 160 churches across the length and breadth of Scotland. We are local churches who recognise that if we are to fulfil the commission Jesus has given his disciples, it is better to work together than continue alone.
CanopyJoin us in October for Canopy, our new online gathering for all Scottish Baptist churches. Over the weekend we will pray together, listen to God’s word, hear inspirational speakers, tell stories of what God is doing in his church and expect him to speak into our lives and communities.

Prayer
Prayer is at the heart of our Union. The prayer calendar is a framework to help individuals or congregations pray for all our churches throughout the year.  Every Sunday evening several hundred people from our churches across Scotland join in our National Prayer Livestream.
