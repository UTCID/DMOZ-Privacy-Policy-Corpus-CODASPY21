1. Questions:
What is a Medical Illustrator?
A Medical Illustrator is an artist who renders images and/or animations of the human body in various forms for the purpose of educating a specific audience. Medical illustrators undergo rigorous academic and artistic training at only a handful of schools across the country. A typical curriculum includes Human Gross Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Neuroanatomy, Embryology, Surgical Observation, along with a host of artistic and computer technology courses. All the Medical Illustrators at Anatomical Justice are board certified by the Association of Medical Illustrators (AMI), which is analogous to Board Certification for Physicians.
How experienced is your staff?
Our team of Board Certified Medical Illustrators have a combined 50 years experience in the creation of Demonstrative Evidence, which encompasses a variety of digital and traditional media. We help take the stress out of your prep work, saving you time and aggravation. Our customers rely on us to help guide them through complex issues, which plays a critical role in their case-winning strategies.
How do I place an order?
Please refer to our How to Order page.
What information do I send to get a quote?
In most cases at least one or more of the following are necessary for us to generate a quote:
Your Contact Information
Description of your Project Ideas
Hospital Records
Deposition Transcripts
Police Reports
Radiological Films
Photographs
Film or Video
Where do I send my information?
Please refer to our Contact page.
How much does it cost?
Please refer to our Pricing page.
How long does it take?
While we can work with any deadline, a typical timeframe would be one to four (1 – 4) weeks from retainer payment and quote approval. Work cannot commence without a paid retainer and signed contract agreement. Quotes are written within one to five (1 – 5) days from the time we receive your case information. Please notify us of any specific deadline issues.
Can I get a digital copy of my order?
Yes. Medical Illustrations and Forensic Art are normally delivered to the client as a hardcopy, digital file, or both. Presentation and animation formats vary as well, but most are delivered to the client in a digital format, either on a CD or DVD. Digital files can also be transmitted via e-mail or FTP.
Do you work with our experts?
Absolutely. While not every case requires expert review, (i.e. Focus Groups, Mediation, Demand Packages, etc.) our staff works directly with your Medical, Forensic, or Technical experts to ensure accuracy. Our ability to understand and communicate complicated medical/technical information with your experts will save you time and money. If you provide us with your experts’ contact information, we can work directly with them until they are satisfied our product is a fair and accurate representation of your case facts.
Do you testify in court?
Very rarely. Our appearance in court would be required only to aid in an admission of our artwork into evidence. Our artwork is used to reinforce your expert, victim or witness testimony. We can testify only to our expertise as Medical Illustrators and Forensic Artists. We cannot testify to the medical accuracy of your case or identification of a suspect. With Medical Demonstrative Evidence, your medical expert is responsible for the accuracy of the evidence they are utilizing. In Forensic cases, it is the witness who will be identifying the accused. If a suspect can be identified based upon the artwork, law enforcement should view this as a starting point. Direct evidence will be needed to secure a favorable judgment. Please read our Disclaimer on our Privacy & Terms page.
How effective is your demonstrative art?
Capturing your audience is our first priority. An effective piece of Demonstrative Art, whether for print or video, a model, or computer animation, engages and educates. It does this in a simple, concise manner without being overwhelming or confusing. Striking renderings, medical accuracy, vibrant colors, realistic movement, and fascinating compositions are but a few techniques used in creating effective Demonstrative Art. We make certain that the medium does not overwhelm the message. If the artwork distracts from your facts, you may loose your audience. Education is the benchmark for success. A lay audience must be able to follow the facts without loss of comprehension. See for yourself what our clients say about Anatomical Justice!
