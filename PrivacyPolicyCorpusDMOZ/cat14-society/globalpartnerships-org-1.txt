General Provisions
The materials on this GP website are presented solely for promotional purposes in the United States and internationally. This site is operated under the supervision of GP from its offices within the state of Washington. Our site may describe products that are not available worldwide. GP does not warrant or represent that materials on our site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you choose to access our site from other locations, you do so at your own initiative and you are responsible for complying with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. You may not download or otherwise export or re-export software from our site in violation of United States export controls.
You agree that this site shall be deemed solely based in Washington, and that this site shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over GP, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Washington. These Terms & Conditions shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the state of Washington, as they are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Washington. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to this site shall be barred permanently unless such claim or cause of action is brought within one year after it arises; any such claim or cause of action shall be brought only in the state or federal courts in the state of Washington, and you consent to jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating such actions.
Whenever possible, each provision of these terms shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision is deemed prohibited or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of these terms.
This is the entire agreement between us relating to your use of this site. These terms may not be modified by you, in writing or otherwise, unless agreed to in a written document signed by GP.
These Terms & Conditions, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned by you, but may be assigned by GP without restriction.
GP has the right, in its sole judgment, to block access from a particular Internet address or to suspend or terminate a user’s account for violations of these Terms & Conditions. In addition, GP reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms & Conditions.
