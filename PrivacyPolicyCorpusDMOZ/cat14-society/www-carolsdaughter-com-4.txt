From humble beginnings in her kitchen, Carol’s Daughter founder Lisa Price transformed her beloved hobby of mixing fragrances at home into a beauty empire. After selling her natural beauty products at flea markets and from her living room, Price officially established Carol's Daughter, lovingly named for her mother. Today, we offer prestige hair, body and skincare products made with rare, natural ingredients like Monoi Oil, Cocoa and Shea Butters and Açai. We have collections that repair damaged hair (top-seller Monoi), perfect curls (classic Hair Milk) and soothe skin (favorite Almond Cookie).
Our Customer Service hours of operation are Monday – Friday, 8 AM – 5:30 PM (ET).
