A pair of renegades from the Pac-12 helped stun defending national champion LSU on Saturday.
Former Stanford quarterback K.J. Costello passed for an SEC-record 623 yards and five touchdowns in the Mississippi State debut of former Washington State head coach Mike Leach’s “Air Raid” offense, and the Bulldogs knocked off the sixth-ranked Tigers in Baton Rouge 44-34.
Costello’s passing yardage in his first game since transferring from Stanford to Starkville, Miss., eclipsed the 544 yards Georgia’s Eric Zeier had against Southern Mississippi in 1993 to set the SEC record. Four of Costello’s touchdown passes covered between 24 and 75 yards.
“I don’t know if any individual could visualize this taking place,” said Costello, who was the Cardinal’s starter in 2017 and 2018 before head and hand injuries sidelined him last season. “I wasn’t visualizing sitting here breaking records. … I’m excited about the potential that this offense has because, believe it or not, we did leave a lot on the field today.”
Costello needed his big day stats to make up for his two interceptions and two lost fumbles, which helped LSU rally to tie the score 34-34 before he engineered two scoring drives in the final 10 minutes.
LSU became the first defending national champion to lose its opening game since Michigan in 1998 lost at Notre Dame.

LSU quarterback Myles Brennan intermittently showed promise in his debut as starter in place of 2019 Heisman Trophy winner and 2020 top NFL draft choice Joe Burrow. But Brennan’s 345 yards and three touchdowns passing could not make up for the trouble the Tigers’ inexperienced defense had in new coordinator Bo Pelini’s scheme.
#2 Alabama 38, Missouri 19: Mac Jones threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns in less than three quarters, many of his throws landing in the capable hands of Jaylen Waddle, and the visiting Crimson Tide began their SEC-only schedule with a romp over the rebuilding Tigers.
Kansas State 38, #3 Oklahoma 35: Skylar Thompson threw for 334 yards and ran for three touchdowns and the visiting Wildcats (1-1) rallied from 21 points down to stun the Sooners (1-1). Freshman Deuce Vaughn caught four passes for 129 yards and ran for a touchdown in the Wildcats’ first road victory over a a top-three team in the AP poll. They rebounded from an opening loss to Arkansas State. Oklahoma freshman Spencer Rattler passed for 387 yards and four touchdowns, but threw three interceptions. Kansas State upset Oklahoma 48-41 in Manhattan, Kan., last year. Two short rushing touchdowns by Thompson got the Wildcats back in the game. Nick Allen blocked Reeves Mundschau’s punt, and the Wildcats took over at the Oklahoma 38. Vaughn’s 38-yard touchdown run on the Wildcats’ second offensive play and the extra point tied it at 35 with 8:17 to play. Kansas State’s Blake Lynch hit a 50-yard field goal with 4:32 remaining. Jahron McPherson intercepted Rattler’s pass in the final minute.
#4 Georgia 37, Arkansas 10: Stetson Bennett threw two touchdown passes in the third quarter and the visiting Bulldogs rallied in an SEC season opener. Bennett replaced D’Wan Mathis in the second quarter and finished 20-for-29 for 211 yards. Bennett put the Bulldogs ahead to stay with a 19-yard touchdown pass to George Pickens and ran in the two-point conversion to make it 13-10 with 6 minutes left in the third. Feleipe Franks was 19-for-36 for 200 yards and a touchdown in his first start for Arkansas, but the Florida transfer also threw two interceptions. Zamir White rushed for 71 yards and a TD on 13 carries.
#5 Florida 51, Ole Miss 35: Kyle Pitts caught four of Kyle Trask’s six touchdown passes and the visiting Gators spoiled former Oakland Raiders head coach Lane Kiffin’s Mississippi debut. Trask completed 30 of 42 passes for 416 yards, throwing touchdown passes of 1, 16, 71 and 17 yards to Pitts. The tight end had 170 yards receiving in the season and SEC opener for both teams. Kiffin, who also coached Tennessee and USC, came to the Rebels from Florida Atlantic.
#8 Texas 63, Texas Tech 56: Sam Ehlinger threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Joshua Moore in overtime after the visiting Longhorns (2-0, 1-0 Big 12) rallied with two touchdowns in the final three minutes of regulation. Moore’s second touchdown catch came with 40 seconds left and Ehlinger’s two-point conversion pass to Brennan Eagles tied it to get to overtime. Texas got the ball first and quickly scored when Ehlinger and Moore connected for their TD throw of the day. Texas Tech’s possession ended when Alan Bowman was forced to scramble and threw a wild pass that was intercepted by Caden Sterns. Texas, chasing its first Big 12 title since 2009, had looked done when the Red Raiders (1-1, 0-1) went ahead 56-41 late in the fourth quarter on touchdowns from T.J. Vasher and SaRodorick Thompson Jr. But Ehlginer engineered a quick drive for a touchdown pass to Eagles and the Longhorns recovered the onside kick to set up the tying score.
#8 Auburn 29, #23 Kentucky 13: Bo Nix threw for 233 yards and three second-half touchdowns, including two to Seth Williams, and the host Tigers scored twice in the fourth quarter to pull away from the Wildcats in the lone Top 25 matchup of the SEC’s opening weekend.
