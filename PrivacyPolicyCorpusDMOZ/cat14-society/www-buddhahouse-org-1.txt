What is the Chenrezig Mantra?
The six syllables: om ma ni pad me hum, mean that you can transform your impure body, speech, and mind into the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha.
The first known description of the mantra appears in the Karandavyuha Sutra (Buddha speaks Mahayana Sublime Treasure King Sutra), which is part of certain Mahayana canons. In this sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha states: This is the most beneficial mantra. Even I made this aspiration to all the million Buddhas and subsequently received this teaching from Buddha Amitabha.
