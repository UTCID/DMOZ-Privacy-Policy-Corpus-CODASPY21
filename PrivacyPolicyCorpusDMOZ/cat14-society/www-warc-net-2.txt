Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 1, 4, 7, 8, and 12 – 21.
18. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
a. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Sites will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or your use of the Site, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
b. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 18.a, you and Company both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
c. Arbitrator. Any arbitration pursuant to these Terms will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.
d. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, and cannot obtain one, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Company’s address for Notice is:
510 5th Ave SE Quincy, WA 98848, USA , or  (509) 785-8267 . The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). You and Company agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Company do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Company will pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.
e. Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Quicny, Washington , provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
f. No Class Actions. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
g. Modifications. In the event that Company makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Company’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Company’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.
h. Enforceability. If Section 18.f or the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Sites.
19. Consent to Communications and Monitoring/Recording of Telephone Calls.By providing us with your contact information, you agree to receive communications, including via e-mail and calls (including text messages and calls made using an autodialer or prerecorded voice message), from or on behalf of Company, its affiliates, and its sponsors, at the email address or telephone number you provided even if that number is on a National or State Do Not Call List. These calls may be for informational and marketing purposes, such as to provide you with information about treatment services and facilities. Standard text messaging and telephone minute charges applied by your cell phone carrier will apply.  Company and its affiliates and sponsors may, without further notice or warning and in our discretion, monitor and/or record telephone conversations for their business purposes, such as quality assurance and training purposes and to protect their rights and the rights of others.
IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF EMAILS, YOU CAN UNSUBSCRIBE BY FOLLOWING THE UNSUBSCRIBE OPTIONS IN THE EMAIL ITSELF. IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF TEXTS, YOU MAY REPLY “STOP” FROM THE MOBILE DEVICE RECEIVING THE MESSAGES. IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF MARKETING CALLS, YOU MAY MAKE A DO NOT CALL REQUEST DURING ANY CALL YOU RECEIVE. You understand and agree that you may continue to receive communications while your opt-out request is processed, and you may also receive a communication confirming the receipt of your opt-out request.
20. Consent to Electronic Communications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19, by using the Sites, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.
21. Contact Information. The Sites are owned by Warc, located at 510 5th Ave SE Quincy, WA 98848, USA. You may contact us by sending correspondence to the foregoing address or by calling us at  (509) 785-8267.
