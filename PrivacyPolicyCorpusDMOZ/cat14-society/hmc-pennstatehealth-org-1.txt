COVID-19 Patient Visitation Policy
Penn State Health is committed to the safety of patients, staff, visitors and the general public. Given the significant surge in COVID-19 cases in the state and region, per the updated visitation policy, Penn State Health is not allowing visitors in any facilities. Additional changes have been made to the guidelines for family/support persons. Adult inpatients and outpatients may not have a designated family/support person with them unless approved through the exceptions process. Pediatric inpatient, outpatient surgery and emergency department patients may have two family/support persons per stay. Pediatric outpatient procedure/outpatient clinic patients may have one family/support person per stay. Per the visitation restriction policy, no visitors, aside from patient-designated and exception-approved family/support persons, are allowed at this time.
View the visitation restriction policy for detailed information.
