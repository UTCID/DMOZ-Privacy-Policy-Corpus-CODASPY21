enrolments, classes attended and payments (however the platform does
not store any credit card details).
-
Mailchimp: is a mailing lists
management & automation platform that is used to send out our
informational emails regarding our courses and cultural events. The
email address you have submitted is the only information kept.
None of the personal information you provide on these two platforms
is made available to any third parties. Your activity on them is not
monitored. The information is stored but not processed, only used by
The AFD in accordance with the purpose for which you provided the
information and will only be retained for as long as required for
the purpose – save in cases where AFD is required by law to do so
(such as the investigation of a criminal offence by the Gardai).
These two platforms are fully compliant with the GDPR Rights of

that allow you to update your subscription preferences and
