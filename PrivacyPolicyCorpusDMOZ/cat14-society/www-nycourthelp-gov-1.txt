DIY Forms
English | Español
These computer programs ask you questions. The program then uses your answers to make a form for your case or to make an information sheet to help you in court.
These programs are not e-fileable. Your paper must be printed, then filed at the Court.
Available DIY Forms
NYS DIY Forms are only for court users who don't have a lawyer and legal services and pro bono attorneys and staff helping clients who cannot afford lawyers. Commercial use is prohibited and no one may charge for using these programs. When you begin the program, you will be asked to accept these terms of use.
