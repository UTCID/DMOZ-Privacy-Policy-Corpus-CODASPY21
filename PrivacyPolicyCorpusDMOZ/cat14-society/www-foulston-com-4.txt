HIPAA has been around for years and many healthcare providers have not updated policies and procedures since then. Recognizing that health care providers do not have the time to go back to the drawing board to update outdated HIPAA Privacy policies and procedures, Foulston Siefkin attorneys have developed a comprehensive HIPAA Privacy Implementation Handbook, which includes the necessary modifications to comply with the MegaRule. The Implementation Handbook contains sample policies and procedures, as well as sample notices, forms, and other tools, including, among others, a Notice of Privacy Practices, a Business Associate Agreement, authorizations, breach notification forms, and a privacy complaint log. Also included with the Handbook is a CD containing all documents in Microsoft Word format.
