CIR’s Privacy Policy
T
he Center for Individual Rights respects the privacy of its donors and their choice not to have personal information shared with others — regardless whether they give online or by mail.
CIR does not and will not sell, rent, or trade any donor information (name, physical address, email address, phone number, online visitor information) to any organization that uses such information for commercial or for-profit purposes.
Occasionally, CIR makes donor mailing lists (name and physical address only) available for one-time use by selected nonprofits (generally with other conservative and libertarian organizations) in return for donor lists from those organizations. (This helps CIR continue to grow.)
Our donors may instruct that we exclude their information from any lists that we share. Donors who contribute online can view and select among all opt-out options on the online donation form.
Donors can also mail opt-out requests to Terry Pell, Center for Individual Rights, 1100 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite 625, Washington, D.C. 20036; or you may email him using the website contact form here, or phone him at 202-833-8400, ext. 113 or you can fax him at (202) 833-8410. Such requests will be implemented promptly.
While we customarily recognize our donors in our Annual Report, all donors have the option to remain anonymous, and such requests may be made on the online donations form or can be directed to Terry Pell at the numbers noted above.
