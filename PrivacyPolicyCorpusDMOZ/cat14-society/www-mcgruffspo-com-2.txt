Any declined payment costs shall be borne by the User.

DeliveryDelivery Deliveries are made during normal business hours at the address indicated by the User and in the manner specified in the order summary. Upon delivery, the User must verify the contents specifying any anomalies in the delivery form. In case of failure to collect the products by the deadline set by the carrier, the products will be returned to the Owner, who will refund the purchase price but not the shipping cost. The Owner cannot be held responsible for errors in delivery due to inaccuracies or incompleteness in the completion of the purchase order by the User, for any damage occurring to products after delivery to the carrier company where arranged by the User or for delays in delivery attributable to it. Right of withdrawal and guaranteeRight of withdrawal In case of purchase of products or services via Sticker Mule the User has the right to terminate the contract without specifying the reason, within 14 days. The withdrawal period expires after 14 days from the day on which the User or a third party – other than the carrier and designated by the User – takes physical possession of the products. To exercise the right of withdrawal, the User is obliged to inform the Owner of their decision to cancel by sending an unequivocal statement to the designated contacts. To this end, a template withdrawal form provided within the “definitions” section of this document is available to the User. Users are, however, free to express their wish to withdraw in any other equivalent way. Effects of withdrawal Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including those covering the cost of delivery (except for the additional costs arising from a possible choice of a certain type of delivery other than the standard delivery method, which would have incurred lower delivery costs) without undue delay and in any event no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the present contract. Reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used by the User for the initial transaction, unless the User has expressly agreed otherwise; in any event the User shall not incur any additional costs as a result of such reimbursement. The reimbursement may be withheld until reception of the goods, or until the User has supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest. The User shall send back the goods and return them to the Owner without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which the User communicated his/her intention to withdraw from the contract. The deadline is met if the User sends back the goods before the 14 day period has expired. The costs of returning the goods is borne by the User but will be reimbursed as stated above. The User is solely liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods. Limitations on the right of withdrawal Products returned damaged, or used beyond what is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and inherent functions will be refunded after a deduction of the decrease in value resulting from such damage or use. No refunds will be given when the decrease in value equals the total value. The User is asked to return the goods attaching a copy of the delivery slip received. The right of withdrawal is excluded in all cases relating to:
Goods made to specifications or clearly personalized; Goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly; Sealed goods which are not suitable to be returned for reasons of hygiene or the protection of health, if such goods were unsealed after delivery.
If one of the above exceptions is applicable to the goods purchased, the User may not exercise the right of withdrawal. Applicability of the right of withdrawal The clauses referring to the exercise of the right of withdrawal and its consequences and exceptions, shall apply exclusively to those Users who qualify as consumers, i.e. Users who are acting for purposes which can be regarded as outside their trade (or entrepreneurial activity) or profession.

To exercise the right of guarantee, the User is obliged to contact the Owner, using the contact information contained in this document, and provide an accurate description of the defect. If the product does not conform to the description, the User has the right to a repair or replacement of the product. The User also has a right to request a fair price reduction or the termination of the contract, in the following cases:
If repair and replacement are impossible or prohibitively expensive; If the Owner has not taken steps to repair or replace the goods within a reasonable period, not less than 15 days; Whenever a previously carried out replacement or repair has caused significant inconvenience to the User.
The User is obliged to return the defective products.
