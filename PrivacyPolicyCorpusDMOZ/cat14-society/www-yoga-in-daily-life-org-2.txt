We have taken extensive technical and operational precautions in order to protect personal data from unauthorized access and misuse. Our security procedures are monitored regularly and updated in line with technological progress.
Event Participation
All our yoga events (seminars, workshops, travel etc.) are organized in various countries as a continuous series of events and are dedicated to personal health, spiritual as well as personal development.
By registering for any yoga event, you explicitly agree - with your sign to the application - to the processing of your personal data. You understand, that the processing of these takes place in accordance with the EU GDPR law. You read and understand the further information of this Privacy Policy that you have taken note of and you know about your right to information.
This personal data is collected only to organize the event and because the state authorities in the event countries require extensive data. The personal data will not be used for advertising purposes or passed on to unauthorized institutions.
Information on the Personal Data Processing
The personal data subject (i.e. the event participant) acknowledges that the national Yoga in Daily Life® associations and the International Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram Fellowship (hereinafter referred to as 'the Associations'), as the data controllers and as the data processors, are authorized to process subject personal data stated in the application (e.g. first name, surname, address, telephone, email, etc.) for the purpose of fulfilling the Associations´ contractual obligations arising from the subject’s participation in the ongoing series of yoga events.
The personal data subject acknowledge that the Associations are - to the extent necessary and for as long as necessary for the given purpose of processing - authorized to process their personal data necessary for the fulfillment of legal obligations arising for the Associations from the valid accounting and tax legislation, and also if this is necessary for the protection of rights and legitimate interests of the Associations.
In this regard, every participant of such events can at any time ask the Associations for access to their own subject personal data. If the Associations or the processor processes the personal data in a way that would conflict with the protection of the private and personal life, or contravene the law, the personal data subject can ask the Associations or the processor for an explanation and demand, that the Associations or the processor remedy the situation thus arisen. This can, in particular, involve blocking, making a correction, supplementing or deleting the subject’s personal data.
The personal data subject understands and explicitly agrees, that in the course of the event the Associations can make official promotional recordings, photos and videos in which the subject may appear. The subject further agrees with their publication on social media and Yoga in Daily Life® websites. After the event, these posts may be shared in private social media. The subject understands, that they may revoke their consent of itself at any time with the exception of printed media. In case the subject does not agree with the appearance in official recordings, photos and videos made at the event, it will notify the Associations´ staff of this fact prior to the commencement of making recordings or photos, and the subject will comply with their instructions to take a position separate from the place where recordings and photos will be made.
Newsletter Subscription
This service enables you to subscribe yourself to one or more of our newsletters. Therefore, if you wish to receive our newsletters, a registration is mandatory, in which context you have to state some of your own personal data (name, e-mail address).
Your personal data stated during the registration is stored and used for the carrying out of the subscription to the newsletter. You may cancel any newsletter you are subscribed to at any time by using a cancellation link at the end of the respective newsletter.
We will not transmit your personal data to any third parties without your explicit consent.
Policy Status
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time according to the applicable law. The current status is May 2018.
