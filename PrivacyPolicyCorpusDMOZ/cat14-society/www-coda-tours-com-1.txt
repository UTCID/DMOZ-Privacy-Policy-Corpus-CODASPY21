Terms & Conditions
To Book A Tour
A deposit, along with a completed Tour Registration form, will reserve a place for you. (You may charge your deposit by phone.) A deposit of $750 per person is required to confirm your place on a tour or cruise. (Special deposits may apply to certain trips. Please check our website.) You may fax or mail your completed Tour Registration form to Coda International Tours, Inc. Final payment is due 90 days prior to departure. Airfare is due at the time tickets are issued, usually two to four months prior to departure.
Individual air arrangements are ticketed at the time of the reservation and require full payment at that time. Prices are quoted in U.S. dollars. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars.
Form Of Payment
WE ACCEPT ALL MAJOR CREDIT CARDS FOR DEPOSITS. FINAL PAYMENT ON ALL PROGRAMS ARE TO BE MADE BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER. CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS FOR FINAL BALANCE ARE ASSESSED AN ADDITIONAL PROCESSING FEE.
Tour Mailings
Once your deposit has been processed, we will mail you a confirmation mailing that includes our suggested Reading List, a complimentary reading selection, an invoice/payment receipt, information about group air arrangements, if applicable, and/or suggestions about independent air arrangements.
A final mailing is sent approximately 21 days prior to departure and includes Destination Information, Travel Tips, Aboard Ship or Train where applicable, a document wallet, a luggage tag, airline tickets, if applicable, and vouchers for independent arrangements, if applicable.
Obtaining Visas
Visas are not included in the cost of the program. We will send you the necessary forms so you can obtain visas through Zierer Visa Service, a professional visa service agency in Washington D.C., New York and San Francisco. Visas should be obtained approximately 1 to 2 months prior to departure on a tour. We will also provide you with information about obtaining visas directly through the consulate or embassy of the country in question. It is the sole responsibility of the traveler to have proper travel documents required for participation on the tour.
Tour Prices
Tour prices include all specifics listed in the brochure under PROGRAM INCLUSIONS. Tour prices do not include those items listed under PROGRAM EXCLUSIONS. International and some domestic airfares are not included, unless otherwise noted. Each tour varies slightly. Prices are based on a minimum number of participants needed to operated the tour.
Minimum Participation
Every effort will be made to operate the program, even if the final number of participants falls below the required number on which the tour was priced. Coda International Tours, Inc. makes no guarantee to operate the program at a loss. We do reserve the right to impose a small group surcharge if this is the only way to assure the operation of the tour. This surcharge will be made only 60 days prior to departure and will be refunded 15 days prior to departure if the total number of participants reaches the minimum number required to operate the tour.
Sharing For Single Travelers
Accommodations in hotels, on ships and trains are based on double occupancy. If you are traveling alone and wish to share accommodations, we will attempt to pair you with another tour guest who has also requested a share. If there is no one with whom you can share, or if you prefer single accommodations, you are requested to pay a Single Supplement fee which is listed in the brochure.
Unforseen Delays
The cost of delays is not included if any tour has to be delayed because of bad weather, sea conditions, road conditions, transportation delays, government intervention, sickness or other contingency for which Coda International Tours, Inc., or its agents cannot make provision.
Trip Cost Increases
Tour costs are subject to increase without prior notice, even after you have signed up on the trip; although, it rarely happens. We publish our prices well in advance of trip departure (often more than a year in advance). Between that time and the time of the trip’s actual departure, we are occasionally faced with significant cost increases which we cannot absorb — i.e., international currency fluctuations or increases in costs of services overseas. We regret this situation, and we do everything we can to avoid raising prices. Information, including rates, may not be in “real time” and we are not responsible for outdated or inaccurate information.
Cancellation Policy
All cancellations of confirmed reservations (reservations on which deposits have been received) are subject to a $500 per person administration fee (or otherwise as noted in the specific brochure of a program.). Additionally, participants are subject to any cancellation fees assessed by the purveyors of services, including airlines or hotels used in the itinerary. Cancellations received 61-90 days prior to departure will be assessed a penalty equal to 10% of the total program cost per person. Cancellations received within 60 days of departure are subject to 100% cancellation penalties.
Requests for cancellations must be made in writing. No refunds will be made for any part of a tour in which you choose not to participate.
NOTE: We recommend taking out Trip Cancellation Insurance.
Cancelled Trips
Coda International Tours, Inc., reserves the right to cancel any trip due to inadequate sign-up which makes the trip economically unfeasible for us to operate. In such a case, a full refund of Tour Cost is given, but Coda International Tours is not responsible for additional expenses incurred by participants in preparing for the trip (i.e., nonrefundable “Advance Purchase” air tickets, visa fees if applicable, medical expenses, special clothing or other personal items purchased for the trip.)
Refunds
No partial refunds will be given for unused hotel rooms, meals, sightseeing trips or transportation for any reason whatsoever. Tour Cost is quoted as a package and credits are not given for services not used.
Your Airline Tickets
When we book your airline reservations, we will try to obtain the best possible fare and routing for you. Some of you may prefer to pay a bit more to take advantage of a particularly convenient routings, specific carriers or to have a more comfortable trip in either Business or First Class. Please indicate your preference on the Tour Registration form. For domestic tickets in the U.S.A. or Mexico, call your travel agent or the airline directly to obtain the best fare.
Reduced-Rate Airfares
Since there is always the possibility of change or delay involved with travel, please keep in mind that many “budget or reduced rate” fares carry restrictions. In many cases, these tickets are nonrefundable, non-endorsable, valid only for travel on specific dates, and may involve traveling by an inconvenient route.
Medical & Health
It is vital that persons with medical problems make them known to us well before departure. The Coda Tour Manger has the right to disqualify anyone at any time during the trip if he feels the participant is physically incapable and/or if a participant’s continued participation will jeopardize the individual involved or the group. Refunds are not given under such circumstances.
Depending on the destination of the tour, vaccinations may be required or recommended. These will be made known to you at the time of your confirmation. However, it is the ultimate responsibility of the participant to check with his/her doctor for a definitive recommendation.
Every traveler should be vaccinated against hepatitis B and hepatitis A, the #1-vaccine preventable traveler’s disease. And all travelers should have updated vaccinations for MMR and tetanus.
No countries require an HIV test for the casual tourist. However, some countries will question anyone arriving into the country who appears ill. All HIV+ travelers must assure having an adequate supply of medicines to take on the tour. All HIV+ travelers need to discuss protection with their physicians, as a few vaccines may be dangerous for immune-compromised people and can cause a temporary increase in viral load counts.
Insurance
Coda International Tours, Inc., makes trip insurance available for purchase. Among coverage types that may be purchased are: unexpected cancellation due to illness, baggage damage & loss, and the unlikely event of insolvency of the tour operator. Trip cancellation insurance is highly recommended. Baggage damage or loss may be covered under some home-owners policies. This is the participants responsibility to verify.
In order to obtain a waiver of pre-existing conditions, the traveler must purchase insurance within 14 days of depositing for the tour. HIV can be considered pre-existing if the condition is not “stable” 60 days prior to the purchase of insurance.
Baggage
Coda International Tours, Inc., assumes no liability for loss or damage in transit to and from a Coda International Tour program. We recommend purchasing the travel insurance package.
Responsibilities Of Participants
Tour participants have certain responsibilities to Coda International Tours, Inc. and to other tour participants: participants are responsible for comprehending the conditions implied in the Tour Itinerary and selecting a tour that is appropriate to their interests and abilities; for preparing for the tour by studying the Tour Itinerary and supplemental tour information sent by Coda International Tours; for following normal social behavior patterns with fellow tour members; for acting in an appropriate and respectful manner in accordance with the customs of countries visited; for completing the itinerary as scheduled (or adjusted en route as necessary.)
At the Coda Tour Manager’s discretion, a participant may be asked to leave the trip if the tour manager feels the person’s further participation may be detrimental to other tour participants or to the individual.
Limitations Of Liability
Coda International Tours, Inc. acts only as agent for the passenger with respect to transportation and hotels and exercises every care possible. However, Coda International Tours, Inc. can assume no liability for injury, damage, loss, accident, delay or irregularity in connection with the services of any ship, airplane, train, automobile, motor coach, carriage or any other conveyance used in carrying out these tours, or for the acts or defaults of any company or person engaged in conveying the passenger or in carrying out the arrangements of the tour. We cannot accept any responsibility for losses or additional expenses due to delay or changes in air or other services, sickness, weather, strike, war, acts of terrorism anywhere in the world that may prevent the operation of the tour or travel of an individual, quarantine, acts of God or other causes beyond our control. All such losses will have to be borne by the passenger, as tour rates provide for arrangements only for the time stated. We reserve the right to make alterations to the itinerary as may be deemed necessary for carrying out the tour. The right is reserved to substitute hotels or ships in similar categories. The right is reserved to cancel any tour prior to departure, in which case the entire payment will be refunded without further obligation on our part. No refund will be made for the unused portion of any tour. By forwarding of deposit, the passenger certifies that he/she does not have any mental, physical or other condition of disability that would create a hazard for him/herself or other passengers.
The right is reserved to decline to accept or to decline to retain any person as a member of any tour should such person’s health or actions affect the welfare of other passengers. Baggage is at the owner’s risk entirely. It is understood that the steamship or air ticket when issued shall constitute the sole contract between the steamship or air company concerned. The airlines concerned are not to be held responsible for any act, omission or event during the time the passengers are not on board their plane or conveyance.
