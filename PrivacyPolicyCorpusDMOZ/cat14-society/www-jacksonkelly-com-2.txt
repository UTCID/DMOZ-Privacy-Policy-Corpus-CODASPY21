The Jackson Kelly PLLC Disclaimer
The materials included in this World Wide Web site have been prepared by Jackson Kelly PLLC for informational purposes only and are not legal advice. This information is not intended to create, and receipt of it does not constitute, a lawyer-client relationship. Internet subscribers and online readers should not act upon this information without seeking professional counsel. Do not send us information until you speak with one of our lawyers and get direction as to what information may be appropriate. This is required because we cannot represent you until we have determined that doing so would not cause a conflict of interest and we have a mutually acceptable written representation agreement with you. If your jurisdiction requires us to designate a principal office and/or a single attorney as responsible for this World Wide Web site, Jackson Kelly PLLC designates its office in Charleston, West Virginia, USA as its principal office and designates Ellen S. Cappellanti, CEO, as the responsible attorney. The rules of some jurisdictions require us to state: THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT.
About Jackson Kelly PLLC
Jackson Kelly PLLC is a professional limited liability company, which, together with predecessor general partnerships, has practiced law since 1822.
No Guarantee of Results
Some of the case summaries, reports of past results and individual lawyer biographies on this website describe past matters handled for clients of the Firm. These descriptions are meant only to provide information to the public about the activities and experience of our lawyers. They are not intended as a guarantee that the same or similar results can be obtained in every matter undertaken by our lawyers. You must not assume that a similar result can be obtained in a legal matter of interest to you. The outcome of a particular matter can depend on a variety of factors—including the specific factual and legal circumstances, the ability of opposing counsel, and, often, unexpected developments beyond the control of any client or lawyer.
Privacy of Client Information
Every lawyer and employee of Jackson Kelly PLLC is required by the Code of Professional Responsibility of his or her state to keep all matters related to the business of our clients and customers confidential. This confidentiality requirement extends to all personnel and precludes discussion of a client's business with persons other than those with a need to know who are actively working for the Firm or who are duly authorized representatives of the client. In addition to the professional requirements of confidentiality, the Firm has a strict policy on confidentiality of client information. We value the trust and confidence which our clients place in us.
