LACBA ILAP is here for you.
We continue to provide legal assistance and counseling to all categories of low-income persons.
Please contact us:  (213) 485-1873 or (213) 485-0143
Email:  smartinez@lacba.org
You are not alone.
The Immigration Legal Assistance Project (ILAP) remains open as the Federal Building remains open, but with limited access to the public.  The ILAP’s information is posted at the office and here on ILAP’s website.  Intakes will be conducted by telephone, and immigration-related advice and applications will be set up for an appointment.
Appointments are recommended in order to adhere to City, County and State social distancing rules.  There will be limited walk-in services available.
To make an appointment, leave your name and phone number and a staff member will call you back.  If it is determined you need an application completed, we will schedule you for an appointment to complete your forms.  Appointments can be set up to complete forms such as renewals for work permits, DACAs, and green cards.  We can also help with filing for naturalization and adjustment of status applications, and family petitions.
If the federal building is closed to the public, then legal services will be moved to a different location and our location will be updated here.
To make an appointment, please call (213) 485-0413.
The Immigration Legal Assistance Project provides, for a nominal fee, legal assistance and counseling to all categories of low-income persons. The project also provides immigration "services" for the private immigration bar. The project uses its limited resources to:
Provide immigration legal advice for U.S. Citizens, immigrants, and aliens.
Prepare immigration and naturalization forms.
Translate, certify, notarize, and copy documents.
Tie in lawyer referral service and all appropriate social service agencies.
Train law students, attorneys, and volunteers in all aspects of immigration law and procedures.

L-R: Jane McCaffrey (Immigration Project Assistant Directing Attorney) and award recipient Suzanne Johnson, attorney volunteer of the year
LACBA’s Immigration Legal Assistance Project has named Suzanne Johnson as its Honorable Benjamin Aranda III Award recipient for 2019.  Suzanne has been helping the immigrant community here in Los Angeles through her work at the Project for more than five years.
Her commitment and dedication to our clients has been invaluable. Without Suzanne’s support, the Project would not have been able to help the 11,000 people we see every year. Her willingness to show up on Thursday mornings, to help consult with clients, or assist with paperwork made a great difference to the Project and the community. The Project depends upon volunteer attorneys, like Suzanne, to help us serve the immigrant community better.
She believes in LACBA’s goal of providing “access to justice” for all members of our society and brings a compassionate attitude to our clients and their families.
DREAMERS
Applying for Deferred Action Status and other immigration benefits
Starting Date: January 1, 2016
The Los Angeles County Bar Association’s Immigration Legal Assistance Project provides legal assistance and counseling to immigrants seeking legal residency and citizenship in the United States. The Immigration Project has received a grant from the State of California to provide “free legal assistance” for Dreamers who are renewing or applying for DACA, as well as DACA applicants who need advance parole, family petitions or adjustment of status. LACBA’s experienced staff immigration attorneys are available to explain the procedures for filing or renewing a Deferred Action Status, including:
Who is eligible for DACA
The impact it could have on immigrants facing deportation hearings
How to avoid falling prey to “notarios,” who are not legal experts nor attorneys
The type of documents that will be needed  to apply or renew DACA
Who is eligible for travel permits, family petitions or adjustment of status
LACBA’s Immigration Legal Assistance Project is located in the USCIS (Immigration Service) Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles and provides low-cost immigration legal services. Consultations are just $20, and no appointments are necessary to meet with our experienced immigration attorney staff, paralegals and volunteer attorneys.
