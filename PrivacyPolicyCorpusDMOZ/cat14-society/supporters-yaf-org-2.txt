Privacy Policy: Mailing List InformationFrom time to time, YAF makes our contributor list of donors available to other organizations to mail. This process is carefully controlled, and it is our hope that you may find information from these groups interesting and helpful. This also saves us a considerable amount of money, which can be used to preserve and protect our shared values. If you would like to be excluded from this, please call us at (800) USA-1776, and we’ll make sure your name is not included in our mailing list sharing activities.
