Donor Privacy Policy
We value our donors, volunteers, and prospects (hereafter referred to as our "supporters") and take their privacy seriously. We will respect the privacy of information that we are privileged to have about our supporters. Our commitment to respect the privacy of our supporters extends to how we obtain, use, protect and share information about them. This privacy policy is intended to be applied in conjunction with related Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity policies, including, but not limited to, our Donor Bill of Rights.
Principles, actions, and beliefs
We will hold strictly all information concerning donors and prospects, including names, addresses, names of beneficiaries, nature and value of estates, amounts of provisions or gifts, etc., unless a donor or prospect grants permission to use selective information for purposes of referral, testimonial, example, recognition, or publicity.
We will not share, sell, rent or otherwise offer information about supporters to other organizations except Habitat for Humanity International.
We contractually require any person or organization providing services to Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity to protect the confidentiality of supporter information.
We have procedures in place to limit access to information to those employees and volunteers who need to know such information in order to fulfill our mission.
We will use our best efforts to comply with the written or oral request of any supporter who does not want their name used in any promotional material, wishes their name removed from solicitation and other mailing lists, or wishes to have their gifts or services be anonymous.
We will collect, use and share information about our supporters among employees and volunteers only on a needs-to-know basis and for the sole purpose of carrying out Twin Cities Habitat’s mission.
Donor Bill of Rights
Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good.  It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the not-for-profit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
The right to be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
The right to be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
The right to have access to the organization's most recent audited financial statements.
The right to be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
The right to receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition or to remain anonymous if desired.
The right to be assured that information about their donations is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
The right to be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
The right to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.
E-Donor Bill of Rights
To be clearly and immediately informed of the organization's name, identity, nonprofit or for-profit status, its mission, and purpose when first accessing the organization's website.
To have easy and clear access to alternative contact information other than through the website or email.
To be assured that all third-party logos, trademarks, trustmarks and other identifying, sponsoring, and/or endorsing symbols displayed on the website are accurate, justified, up-to-date, and clearly explained.
To be informed of whether or not a contribution entitles the donor to a tax deduction, and of all limits on such deduction based on applicable laws.
To be assured that all online transactions and contributions occur through a safe, private, and secure system that protects the donor's personal information.
To be clearly informed if a contribution goes directly to the intended charity, or is held by or transferred through a third party.
To have easy and clear access to an organization's privacy policy posted on its website and be clearly and unambiguously informed about what information an organization is gathering about the donor and how that information will be used.
To be clearly informed of opportunities to opt out of data lists that are sold, shared, rented, or transferred to other organizations.
To not receive unsolicited communications or solicitations unless the donor has "opted in" to receive such materials.
