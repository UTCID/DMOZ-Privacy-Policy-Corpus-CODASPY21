St. James Church Privacy Policy
Updated: August 24, 2018
Welcome to the website (the “Website”) of St. James Church, Menomonee Falls.  This Website is operated by St. James Church (the “Church”). This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) states St. James Church’s policy relative to the information, including personal data and other information, collected from visitors to this Website.
Information Collected
When you visit St. James Church using this Website, the Church may collect personal data from you.  The data collected includes the following:
Personal Information.  The Church only collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis.  This information is provided to the Church by the visitor through the completion and submission of forms, inquiries, and other similar means.  “Personal Information” may include, but is not limited to, a visitor’s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. By voluntarily providing the Church with Personal Information, the provision of such information indicates the visitor’s consent to the Church’s use of the Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.
Non-Personal Information.  When you interact with the Church via this Website, the Church receives and stores certain personally non-identifiable information (“Non-Personal Information”).  Non-Personal Information, which is passively collected using various technologies, cannot be used to identify a specific user.  The Church may store such information itself or in databases owned and maintained by Church affiliates, agents, or service providers.  The Church may aggregate personally non-identifiable information.
Cookies. In connection with the operation of this Website, the Church may employ the use of technology commonly known as “cookies.”  A “cookie” is an element of data that a website can send to the Internet browser of a visitor to that website.  A “cookie” is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on the visitor’s computer or instruct it to perform any step or function.  The “cookie” does not extract any Personal Information.
Use of Information Collected
The Church uses Personal Information a visitor provides in a manner consistent with this Policy.  If a visitor provides Personal Information for a specific reason, the Church will use the Personal Information for the purpose it was provided.  The Church, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents may use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information collected through the Website to improve the content and functionality of the Website.
The Church may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of the Church (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of visitors to the Website, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
Disclosure of Information Collected
The Church will not sell, license, transmit, or disclose information collected to parties unaffiliated with the Church unless such sale, license, transmittal, or disclosure is expressly authorized by the visitor or required or permitted by law.  In all cases, the Church will disclose information collected consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and will require the recipient of such information to protect the information and use it only for the purpose it was provided.
Exclusions
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by the Church other than Personal Information collected through this Website.  The Church shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute any unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Website, such as bulletin boards, any ideas for new information, resources, products or services, and other unsolicited submissions.
Use by Children
The Church does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through this Website. If there is reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information through this Website, please contact the Church.
Security

Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. The Church is not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
