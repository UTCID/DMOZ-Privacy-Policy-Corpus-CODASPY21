How to Help Your Child in the Juvenile Justice System
Download Full Packet: YOUR CHILD AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM
Click here to download this comprehensive packet that will give clients a brief overview of the juvenile court process, definitions of legal terms they might encounter at hearings, and a few tips on how to work with their attorney to defend their child.
Download Spanish version
This resource packet entitled New Rights for Youth in Juvenile
Halls, Ranches, & Camps outlines the rights which you or your youth is
legally entitled to while being detained. If you find that your or your child’s
rights have been violated in any way, please inform your or your child’s
attorney immediately. Click here to learn more about the rights of juvenile
detainees.
Be Proactive
As a parent, you can make a difference in the outcome of your child’s case. From the moment you learn your child has been arrested, begin to see yourself as your child’s advocate. This does not mean that you should “side” with your child or not give them consequences at home. You can be their advocate by empowering yourself and your child with information.
Get Involved
Get the names and numbers of everyone you speak with and everyone involved. Ask anyone involved in the case for his or her business cards. You should have contact information for the court, probation department, and your child’s defense attorney.
Be Prepared
Before going to court for the Arraignment, Pre-Plea Hearing, or Adjudication (trial), try to get letters from counselors, treatment providers, teachers, other school personnel, clergy, or anyone else who knows your child and is willing to speak positively on their behalf. Providing these to your child’s attorney early on may help their case.
Keep in Touch
Keep regular contact with your child’s attorney and anyone else involved with your child’s case after disposition. It’s up to you to coordinate and communicate with all of the people and services involved in your child’s case and be aware of everything that’s going on. Do not expect your child’s Probation Officer, attorney, or your child to stay on top of it. Just assume it’s your job.
Get Organized
Keep copies of all your child’s paperwork. You will get many different documents throughout the time your child is in the juvenile justice system. Keep a folder in a safe place with copies of everything you receive, as well as important paperwork you’ll need to provide to anyone, such as report card or letters of verification of completion of programs or community service hours. Don’t expect your child to take care of or be responsible for any of this.
Buy a calendar so you can record all court dates and appointments with probation, counselors, community service schedule, etc. Keep that calendar in a place where the whole family can see in order to help support your child.
Take Notes and Ask Questions!
Take notes when in court. If terms are used or you are faced with a procedure which you don’t understand, write them down so you can ask your child’s attorney to clarify. Also, take notes on all calls or meetings with probation, your child’s attorney, and anyone else involved in your child’s case.
Yes, it IS a foreign language! People who work in the court system use lingo or numbers to describe or discuss what’s going on. If you hear anything that you don’t understand, such as using a number like “602” to describe your child, don’t be embarrassed, take notes and ask your child’s attorney what it means.
Please refer to our Family Resources page for a few guides that will help you learn how the juvenile system works and what to expect.
Como ayudar a su hijo/a en el sistema juvenil
Sea Proactivo
Como padre/s, usted puede hacer una diferencia en el caso de su hijo/a. Desde el momento que usted descubra que su hijo/a ha sido arrestado, sea un defensor por su hijo/a. Esto no significa que usted no les puede dar consecuencias en la casa. Usted puede apoyar a su hijo/a, estando informados de lo que está pasando en el caso de ellos.
Involúcrese
Escriba todos los nombres de las personas que hablen con usted y todos los que están involucrados en el caso de su hijo/a. También pregunte si las personas tienen tarjetas de negocio. Usted debe de tener la información de la corte, departamento de libertad condicional, y el abogado de su hijo/a.
Prepárese
Antes de ir a la corte para la acusación, audiencia judicial, o al juicio, trate de obtener cartas escritas del consejero/a de la escuela, los lugares de tratamiento, maestros, personajes de la escuela, personas religiosas, o personas que puedan y quieren hablar bien de su hijo/a. Obtenido estas cartas y dándoselas al abogado de su hijo/a al principio del caso puede ser valorable.
Este en Contacto
Mantenga contacto regular con el abogado de su hijo/a y cualquier otra persona involucrado en el caso después de la disposición. Es su responsabilidad de comunicarse con todas las personas en el caso de su hijo/a y estar consiente de todo lo que está pasando. No espere que el agente de libertad condicional, el abogado o su hijo/a ­­­­­­­­le dé información. Tómelo como su trabajo de estar informado de todo lo que está pasando con el caso de su hijo/a.
Organícese
Mantenga copias de todos los papeles del caso de su hijo/a. Usted va recibir varios documentos durante el tiempo que su hijo/a está en el sistema juvenil. Mantenga un cuaderno con todos los documentos que ha recibido o colectado. Estos documentos incluyen las cartas que ha obtenido, boletas de calificaciones, certificado de programas que su hijo/a ha completado y muchos más.
Les ayudaría tener un calendario para apuntar todas las citas de corte, citas con el agente de libertad condicional, consejeros, y servicio comunitario. Mantenga el calendario en un lugar donde toda la familia lo pueda ver.
Cuando vaya a la corte tome notas. Si haya palabras o incidentes que usted no comprende, escríbalas para preguntarle al abogado de su hijo/a. También tome notas de las llamadas que hace, las juntas con el departamento de libertad condicional y cualquier contacto que tenga con las personas involucrados en el caso de su hijo/a.
Haga Preguntas
Sí, es un lenguaje diferente. Las personas que trabajan en la corte usan orto lenguaje o números para describir a su hijo/a o lo que está pasando. Si usted oye algo que no entienda como números “602” para describir a su hijo, no se avergüence, tome notas y pregúntele al abogado de su hijo/a.
Por favor, refiérase a nuestra página de Recursos Familiares para una guía que le ayudara a aprender cómo funciona el sistema juvenil y que esperar.
