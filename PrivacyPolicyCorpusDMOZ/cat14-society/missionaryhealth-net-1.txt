Let's TalkWe’ve tried to make your insurance buying experience a simple one, but we know you may have a question or two.We are sending a team of volunteers to Kenya on a mission trip. This is a first for Heritage Church, and Harvesters International recommended that we look into providing some additional emergency insurance through Insurance Services of America. From the first contact, Adam has been so helpful and cheerful...We have our team now covered for the trip thanks to Adam. We definitely will call her the next time a Heritage team takes an out-of-the country mission trip. Thank you!
