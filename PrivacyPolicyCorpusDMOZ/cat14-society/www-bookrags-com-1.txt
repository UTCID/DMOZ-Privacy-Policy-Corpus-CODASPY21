Subscriptions and Cancellations
BookRags offers a variety of products sold as ongoing monthly or annual subscriptions. When a purchase is made, the buyer is sent a confirmation email with a precise record of their purchase. Please make sure that your purchase is correct at the time of your order by verifying it before you make your purchase.
Monthly subscriptions may be cancelled at any time by logging into your account and clicking on the "My Account" link in the upper right, then clicking the "Manage Subscription" button. There will then be a gray 'Cancel' button next to any active subscription.  Press that button to cancel the subscription.  Once a subscription billing date has passed, you cannot obtain a refund for that month's charge. If you have any questions, please contact us.
In addition, once you make a purchase with us, there is no way in which the study guide can be returned since it can be downloaded, viewed, and printed immediately following your payment. In effect, the study guide is immediately consumed once the purchase is made because there is no way we can get the study guide back or have a user return it. Unless there is an error on the website, you are responsible for the purchase. This is true even if you email us right away.
Please note that we do provide a lot of information up front so that you can make an informed purchase decision when buying from BookRags. Prior to any purchase, we include:
A sample study guide and lesson plan
The length of the study guide, lesson plan, essay, literary criticism, biography, etc.
The beginning of each product or each section of each product (if applicable) for free
All of the section titles on the left-hand navigation bar for study guide and lesson plans so that you can see which sections are included
All of the study pack products (with a preview for each) on the study pack page
