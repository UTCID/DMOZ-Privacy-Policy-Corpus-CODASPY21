Baskets of Hope
Baskets of Hope are specially made centerpieces that will leave a lasting impression on your guests and give hope to local families in need! Let us design centerpieces that help celebrate your occasion— Bar or Bat Mitzvah, anniversary, birthday party, wedding, or any other special celebration.
Baskets are customized to your special occasion. They are beautiful in design, and help express your concern and consideration for those less fortunate! Proceeds from this program go directly toward helping local families in need.
How does it work?
Our Baskets of Hope Coordinator meets with you to customize a basket for your event.
We attach personalized cards to each basket, recognizing your support of the JFS Food and Financial Assistance Program.
We deliver and pick up the baskets from your event site.
A portion of the cost of each centerpiece is tax deductible.
