Land Registration
The Land Registration Act 2002 requires that all land/property in England and Wales is registered with the Land Registry. This is a nationwide task and should be completed by 2012.
The Church is one of the largest owners of property in this country. The Diocesan Board of Finance believes that the registration of the Church titles in the Diocese of Rochester can be carried out efficiently if it is centralised at the Diocesan Office.
This will reduce pressure on parish officers and clergy, and reduce costs for the parish as the Land Registry is willing to give the Diocesan Office a bulk discount.
There is a range of properties including churches, parsonages, glebe land, church schools and church trusts either in the DBF name or associated in one way or another with a parish, through the incumbent and churchwardens or other trustees.
Registration will be scheduled over the next 5 years and undertaken parish by parish, one deanery at a time.
As the programme of work progresses, Melanie Rees, Legal Liaison and Land Registration Officer for the Diocese, will be in touch with the Incumbent and PCC Secretary to nominate a parish contact, ascertain various facts, check details and work through the processes.
