Welcome to the Institute of Charity - Great Britain & New Zealand THE
ROSMINIANS
“The end of this Society is to care lovingly for the sanctification of the members who compose it and, by means of their sanctification, to expend whatever longings and strength it has in all works of charity, and especially for the eternal salvation of every one of its neighbours.”
THE INSTITUTE OF CHARITY
On 16th June  1835, 170 years ago, three foreign priests landed at Tilbury: a young Italian Dr. Luigi Gentili, and two Frenchmen, Frs Anthony Rey and Emilius Belisy. These men were Rosminian Fathers. They were the pioneer members of the Institute of Charity, only founded in 1828 by the saintly, noble Roveretan philosopher, Fr Antonio Rosmini. Within a decade they were largely to transform the shy face of English Catholicism such as was emerging after the Catholic Emancipation of 1829.These priests were to give it a bolder, more dramatic, dynamic and devotional aspect. The society, consisting of both priests and brothers, is dediacted to universal charity, and so is open, under Providence, to any work in the service of the Church.At the present time the brethren of England & Wales are mainly occupied with parish work in the Midlands and South Wales, but  members also work in New Zealand and Italy

Pope Gregory XVI
“We are fully aware and know from experience that our beloved son, the priest Antonio Rosmini, founder of the Institute, is a man of eminent intellect, adorned with noble qualities of soul, exceedingly famous for his knowledge of things human and divine, outstanding for his remarkable piety, religion, virtue, probity, prudence and integrity, conspicuous for his wonderful love and loyalty to the Catholic religion and to this Apostolic See…” (Gregory XVI, In sublimi militantis Ecclesiae solio).

Religious Vocations
Nearly all other Religious Congregations or Orders have a specific mission for the Church, and for the world, the Institute of Charity has universal charity as its charism.This means, first of all, that the initial path for its members is the contemplative life, that is, a life dedicated entirely to purification from vices and sinful inclinations, acquisition of all Christian virtues, and closest possible union with God.However, whilst they are dedicated to this essential spiritual work, they are open to undertake whatever mission or works of charity which God indicates to them by means of obedience. All avenues are, therefore, open to the members of the Institute, in proportion to their gifts, talents, and generosity of heart.
Hence, Rosminians may be involved in three different forms of charity, forms which encompass the whole of universal charity: temporal works of charity (corporal works of mercy, which include feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, for orphans, for lepers, for the blind, etc.); intellectual work of charity (teaching in schools, in colleges, lecturing in Universities, writings books, instructing, counselling, etc.) and spiritual works of charity (pastoral work in parishes, in the missions, in retreat centres, in hospitals, etc.).They are not called and formed for one particular mission, be it teaching, missionary activity, contemplative life, parish work, hospital work, education of the youth, etc. The spectrum for them is universal charity.

Blessed Antonio Rosmini was a great priest and an "illustrious man of culture" who generously dedicated his life to harmonizing the relationship between reason and faith, the pope said just a few hours before Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins led the Nov. 18 beatification ceremony in the northern Italian city of Novara.
