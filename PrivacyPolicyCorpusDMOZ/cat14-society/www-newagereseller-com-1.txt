We respect your privacy. We only use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a personalized shopping experience.
What information do we collect?
When you order from us as a Customer, you submit your name, email address and country. This information allows us to fulfill your orders and to contact you if the need arises.
Will you disclose this Information?
No. Information gathered on this site is NEVER made available to third party vendors and NEVER sold to mailing list distributors.
Email Notifications
When you purchase products from us, you will receive an automated receipt by email. We only email you in person if we need to clarify details about your order or if we are responding to your questions or queries.
Credit and Debit Card Information
As we use PayPal to securely process credit card and debit card orders, we do not have any access to your credit card information at all. When you make a purchase at this store, you are transferred to the secure servers of PayPal. No credit card information is ever stored in our site database.
Cookie Usage, Security and Safe Shopping
This website uses cookies to store information on your local computer. These cookies do NOT contain any of your private information; they serve only to store items in your Shopping Basket.
What information do we collect for a store installation?
In order to install a store for you, we need access to your web host account. This is necessary to import the MYSQL database of products and to upload the store’s shopping cart software to your server via FTP. Your web host login credentials are kept secure (only the person who is installing the store will have access to your information). As soon as your store has been installed, you may change the password to your web host account.
