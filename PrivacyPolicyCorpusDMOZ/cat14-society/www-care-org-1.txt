Privacy Policy
We at CARE are grateful to all of our supporters including donors who help us do our work.  We believe that transparency with our supporters enhances the quality of our programs, accountability, and the trust placed in us. As such, we would like to share how we collect and use your personal information and how we intend to respect your privacy preferences.
By accessing our website and/or submitting your personal information to us, you are agreeing that: (1) you will abide by the practice described in this Policy, and (2) CARE may use the information in accordance with this Policy. Further, if you reside outside the United States, you understand and agree that your personal information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
Information We Collect and Why
The information we may collect includes information you provide us directly, as well as information provided by third parties or automatically through your use of our website. This information enables us to improve our work, communicate with you about our programs, respond to your inquiries and provide support, fulfill your requests and donations, and for other donor service purposes. We also use information to improve our understanding of your interests and better tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, such as newsletters or other information we think may interest you.
Information We Collect Directly From You
Personal information collected may include your name, postal address, telephone number(s), email address(s), or other information. We also request that you provide us with additional personal information, such as credit card information, on our online donation pages to properly enable donation transaction processing.
Information We Collect Automatically
We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our website through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; the length of time and number of times you visit our site and or use our services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our site, and the following: access time, browser type, device ID, domain name, IP address, page views, pages visited and referring URL.  We may combine this information with other information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your user name, name, and other personal information  For more information, please review “Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms” for more information.
Information that We May Collect About You from Social Networking Sites. If you log into our Site using a social media service, you may be required to enter the email address, username, and/or password associated with that social media service. By logging in through a service, you could be granting us access to certain information hosted by the service, such as account information (this includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, contact information, email address, and any other information you have set to public on your account) and information posted on your feed or timeline. You will receive notification of and have the ability to consent to the specific information that would be shared through the sign-in process. We store the information that we receive from social media services with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.
CARE’s Information Security Measures
When you donate to CARE online, your credit card information is secured by an independent security company. Also, your credit card number is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored. You will see the “closed” lock symbol in the lower part of your browser screen (often times it is yellow as well) when you are on our secure donation pages. You will also notice in your web site(s) address bar that the domain name starts with an “https” on those donation pages. This means that information entered on those pages is encrypted for your security. This actually makes it more secure than using a credit card in physical form at a store for example. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.
If you have any questions regarding the security of your credit card donation online, please email us at info@care.org or call 1-800-422-7385 for more information.
