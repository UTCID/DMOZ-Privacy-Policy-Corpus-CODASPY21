Terms & Conditions
IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
Terms & Conditions
The Terms & Conditions were last updated on September 22, 2020. The previous version of the Terms & Conditions can be found here.
Welcome to this website which is owned and operated by Christianbook, LLC (“Christianbook,” “we,” and “us”). These Terms & Conditions (also referred to below as the “Agreement”) constitute an agreement between you and Christianbook, and its affiliated and subsidiary companies, which governs the use of this website and any web page which is a part of this website, your registration with this website, and your purchase, receipt, and/or licensing of any material, product or service through this website or through telephone orders or mail orders through our catalogs or otherwise.
THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS ARE AN ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT BETWEEN US WHICH AFFECTS OUR RESPECTIVE LEGAL RIGHTS AND INCLUDES A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT AND DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.
We recommend you print out a copy of these Terms & Conditions for your records, and can download them here. Upon request by you or Christianbook, we each agree to sign and provide to each other a signed copy of these Terms & Conditions.
ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONSAs noted above, by using this website, purchasing, receiving, and/or licensing any materials, products or services through this website, and/or registering with this website, you agree to be bound fully by the provisions below, without change, as are published at such time. You agree to use this website solely in accordance and compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS & CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE, VISIT ANY PAGE WHICH IS A PART OF THIS WEBSITE, REGISTER WITH THIS WEBSITE, OR RECEIVE, PURCHASE OR LICENSE ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENTThese Terms & Conditions were last updated on Feb 24, 2020 and apply to all uses, purchases, or registrations occurring on or after that date. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms & Conditions at any time by posting a change notice or new agreement on this website, but such changes shall not apply retroactively. The previous version of the Terms & Conditions can be found here.
DISPUTES – THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATEAt Christianbook, we work hard to make things right with each and every customer. On occasion, a third party may be necessary to help us resolve our disputes, and this Agreement limits us to arbitration (or small claims court, if a claim qualifies) in the following instances.
YOU AND CHRISTIANBOOK AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE, ANY MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD, PROVIDED OR LICENSED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE, OR THE ACTIONS OF CHRISTIANBOOK OR ITS AGENTS THAT WE CANNOT RESOLVE INFORMALLY SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED BELOW.
YOU AND CHRISTIANBOOK FURTHER AGREE TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY WAY IN A CLASS ACTION/CLASS ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHERWISE TO MAKE OR PROCEED WITH ANY CLAIM ON A COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND CHRISTIANBOOK AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
This arbitration agreement applies to all agents, attorneys, contractors, subcontractors, service providers, employees, and all others acting for, on behalf of, or under the direction of Christianbook, including all affiliated companies (including, but not limited to, parents, subsidiaries, and sibling corporations). This Agreement is binding on you and Christianbook, as well as our respective heirs, successors, and assigns.
You and Christianbook agree that any claim between us involves commerce under, and is governed exclusively by, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal law, and not by any state or local laws, or the laws of other countries, concerning or purporting to place limits on the availability or scope of arbitration or in any way imposing requirements beyond or inconsistent with those set forth in the FAA. This Agreement, however, does not prevent you from bringing any issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Arbitration Scope, Rules, and Requirements
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and discovery and court review of an arbitration award are limited. However, an arbitrator under this Agreement can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms & Conditions as a court would.
The arbitration or small claims court action shall occur in the United States in the county or parish in which you reside or at such other location in the United States which may be agreed upon by you and Christianbook. You may also choose to have any arbitration, whether commenced by you or us, conducted by telephone or based on written submissions only.
The arbitrator has the authority to and shall resolve all claims and issues arising between us, including, but not limited to, international, federal, state, and local statutory, regulatory, constitutional, and common law claims.
This arbitration requirement covers, but is not limited to, any and all claims arising from or related in any way to your use of this website, your registration with this website, your purchase of or attempt to purchase products through this website, and your communications with Christianbook.
The arbitrator also has the sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this arbitration clause, the scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of any claim or issue arising between us.
Any arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator and will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") as currently in effect, and as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org/consumer, by calling the AAA at 800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. To the extent that there is a conflict between this clause and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall resolve such conflicts so as to preserve the parties’ mutual obligation to arbitrate claims on an individual basis.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the AAA and to: Bridget Timmins, Vice President, Executive Assistant to the President, P. O. Box 8000, 140 Summit Street, Peabody, MA 01961-8000. The AAA’s address is: American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043. You may also send a copy to the AAA online at https://www.adr.org.
If you initiate an arbitration, Christianbook will reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may be required under the AAA Rules for claims under $10,000. For claims over $10,000, payment of such fees will be by a separate agreement between you and Christianbook. If we cannot agree on such payment, the arbitrator will decide how such fees should be paid and by whom. Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees except as provided by applicable law or the AAA Rules.
We are committed to providing for dispute resolution at a reasonable cost to consumers consistent with the AAA Rules, and any matters related to such cost, if not agreed to by you and Christianbook, will be decided by the arbitrator.

CHRISTIANBOOK GIFT CARDS TERMS & CONDITIONS

Christianbook gift cards cannot be used to purchase gift cards and may only be used toward the purchase of eligible goods provided by Christianbook and its affiliates. Eligible goods and services are subject to change in our sole discretion. Gift cards are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund, except to the extent required by law. Gift cards are not re-sellable. The risk of loss and title for gift cards pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission or mailing of the gift card to the purchaser or recipient.   We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors, related to gift cards and reserve the right to cancel any orders resulting from such errors. If we suspect any fraud or misuse in connection with a gift card, we reserve the right in our discretion to suspend or terminate use of the gift card.

Any unused balance will be maintained in the recipient's gift card account and is not transferable. If you make a purchase through your gift card and there are insufficient funds held on the gift card to cover that purchase, you must pay the difference by a valid credit card or debit card or through PayPal, if you are a US customer.
