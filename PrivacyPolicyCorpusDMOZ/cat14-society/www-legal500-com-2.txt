Banking and finance
Tier 1
Herzog Fox & Neeman’s banking and finance practice houses distinct offerings in corporate lending, where it primarily acts for banks, market regulation and payment methods. Alan Sacks is a high-profile name and specialises in cross-border transactions, including recent work for Credit Suisse, Singapore Branch and Fortress Investment Group. Natalie Jacobs is highly regarded for her expertise in structured finance and derivatives — for both Israeli and international banks — as well as institutional investors. Roy Nachimzon’s broad practice spans both banking and finance and corporate law, and he is routinely engaged by foreign and domestic banks, institutional investors and private equity funds to advise on finance deals, with a particular focus on acquisition finance. Ben Kanter is also noted.

Herzog Fox & Neeman's practice is involved in leading IPOs and bond offerings in Israel and on foreign stock exchanges (Nasdaq, the LSE and Singapore exchange, to name a few), including those relating to the country's anti-concentration law, where it acts for issuers and underwriters. It also handles regulatory matters, from the first-ever registration of global funds in Israel to the registration of a foreign company as an underwriter and a remote member of the Tase. The group also acts for clients in the cannabis and blockchain industries seeking to gain the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in Israel and attract investment through public offerings. Ehud Sol and Ilanit Landesman-Yogev advised Israel Electric Corporation on its NIS1.7bn public offering of bonds, which was three-times oversubscribed by investors. Associate Zecharia Rechtschaffen, who specialises in securities, fintech and investment management, is notable for his involvement in numerous significant mandates, including the IPO of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in July 2019. Yehuda Aharoni was promoted to the partnership in 2020.

Herzog Fox & Neeman is one of Israel’s largest law firms and has earned a reputation as a market leader evident by its recognition as ‘2016 Israel Law Firm of the Year’ by Mergermarket, IFLR, BDI Code and Dun & Bradstreet, and its consistent top-tier rankings in both international and Israeli legal ranking directories.
Herzog Fox & Neeman’s pro bono activities are overseen by a dedicated committee to ensure that the talents and skills of all Herzog Fox & Neeman lawyers are utilized to further a more just world.
We provide pro bono legal services to non-profit entities, government and academic institutions, people lacking access to justice and more. For example, our firm was highly involved in representing the families of kidnapped soldiers held in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip for many years. The firm also organizes periodic community activities (examples include working with disabled children; teaching legal topics in junior high schools; and distributing toys in hospitals).  Additionally, Herzog Fox & Neeman provides support and assistance to pro bono activities of the Israeli Bar Association from time to time.
We aim to strengthen rights of all communities, encourage economic growth and promote access to justice in the services we provide as well as by supporting organizations committed to furthering these ends.
Herzog Fox & Neeman also champions and promotes awareness and advancement of issues of diversity, and as part of extensive efforts, has established procedures that ensure progress and promotion both within the firm and outwardly. As a top Israeli law firm, we aspire to be a leader in the field of diversity, having initiated programs and processes that have expanded the diversity of our own employees, both through targeted recruitment, as well as through the support, development and advancement of employees within the firm.
Further to Herzog Fox & Neeman’s values of a diverse and skilled workforce and, in addition to years of emphasizing and implementing a diversity plan and a Diversity Committee within the culture of the firm, Herzog Fox & Neeman has taken an active role in Zionism 2000 – a leading social non-profit in Israel. This organization is committed to bringing together both individuals and organizations interested in contributing towards promoting a new and improved social agenda.
Additionally, Herzog Fox & Neeman is affiliated with a number of other social organizations, including collaborating with Kav Mashve on the recruitment of Arab university graduates.
