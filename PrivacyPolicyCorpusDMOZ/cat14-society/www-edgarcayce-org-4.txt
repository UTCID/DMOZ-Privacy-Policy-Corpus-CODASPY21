The Readings
Helpful Resources for Overcoming Fear, Anxiety, and Stress
The Edgar Cayce readings are a rich source of holistic advice for strengthening the body, mind, and spirit.  During this time of uncertainty, it is helpful to have resources that can aid in overcoming the stress, fear, and anxiety of the current situation.  Now more than ever, we need to come together as a community to help each other and lift each other up.  The Edgar Cayce material would say, "There is a great deal we can do."

Edgar Cayce on Health and Wellness
The Cayce readings suggest that plenty of sleep, plenty of water, relaxation, and a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables can all bolster the alkalinity of the body and an individual’s immune system.  The information from the readings on health included simple suggestions that each of us can follow to stay well.
Health & Wellness
Meditation
Edgar Cayce would also recommend meditation to help calm your mind and center your spiritual self. It is hard to deal with so many of life’s events when we find ourselves incapable of putting our best self in the situation. Meditation can help do just that. TO get you started, listen to this special meditation led by M.E. Hart.
