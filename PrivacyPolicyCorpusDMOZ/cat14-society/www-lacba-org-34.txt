A Collaborative Project of:
The Law Firm of Greenberg Glusker, Reed Smith, The Los Angeles County Bar Association ALSP, Bet Tzedek Legal Services, The Loyola
Center for Conflict Resolution, and Southwestern Law School.
Welcome to the Small Claims Project, which provides education and assistance to self-represented litigants in a workshop/clinic setting.
The Project is an innovative and collaborative program first developed in 2009 by the Los Angeles County Bar Association (LACBA) and Bet Tzedek Legal Services to help Small Claims litigants. The collaboration was joined by the law firms of Greenberg Glusker and Reed Smith, Southwestern Law School, and Loyola Center for Conflict Resolution.
On a monthly basis, volunteer attorneys and Southwestern law students conduct detailed Small Claims workshops open to both plaintiffs and defendants, hosted at Southwestern Law School. Following the one-hour PowerPoint presentation, litigants are invited to discuss the option of mediation with a mediation representative, and have the ability to meet one-on-one with a volunteer to clarify procedural issues, ask additional questions, and prepare for their hearings. Litigants are seen on a “first come, first served” basis. With an average of 30 participants attending each workshop, the project has assisted over 1,000 litigants. Outreach efforts specifically target low-income Angelenos. The presentation and one-on-one meetings are conducted in both English and Spanish.
In conjunction with the Small Claims Project, Southwestern Law School additionally hosts the Inner City Law Center’s (ICLC) Small Claims Outreach program. After the general workshop, tenants seeking to enforce their rights in Small Claims Court have the further option of meeting with an ICLC volunteer for free
one-on-one legal assistance.
Visit the Southwestern Law School website for more information on the Small Claims Workshop and Clinic.
The Project has created materials hosted on the LACBA website for the general public. Please see below for workshop details and materials.
Small Claims Workshop & Clinic Online Forms and Informational Packets
The forms and informational packets are available online as a complement to the FREE monthly workshop/clinic.
The forms at this website cannot be completed online. You can
download and save them to your computer or print them. If you'd like, you can
bring completed forms to the next workshop/clinic (you must register first) and
a volunteer advocate will review them with you.
In addition to the forms, the informational packets provide an overview of the Small Claims process, with a particular focus on (a) how to identify the appropriate parties to name in your action, and (b) the proper way to serve the action. You will also find
practical tips about the Small Claims process, the hearing and the Judgment that you may
obtain.
