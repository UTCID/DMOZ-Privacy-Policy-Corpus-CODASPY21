We comply with United States privacy laws and regulations.

If you choose to access this Site, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. Visitors to this Site from outside the United States acknowledge and agree, by using this Site, that this Site is subject to United States laws and regulations, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.
Legal Significance of This Policy
By accessing any part of this Site or using the Services, you agree to this Policy. This Policy is part of the Terms of Service governing your use of this Site and the Services. Please read the Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of this Policy, please do not use this Site or the Services.
We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and such revisions will become effective upon the earlier of (i) posting of the revisions to this Site, or (ii) distribution by electronic mail. For this reason, please visit this page on a regular basis and check the “Last revised and effective” date at the top of this Policy to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version of this Policy.

This Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to this Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from this Site and that may have its own data collection and use practices and policies. This Policy applies solely to our on-line information gathering and disclosure practices in connection with this Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline.
Children's Privacy
This Site is not for children under 13 years of age. However, there are some areas of this Site that may be attractive to children under 13. We do not condition participation by a child of any age in any activity or service available on or through this Site on the disclosure of more personally-identifiable information than is reasonable necessary to participate in an activity. We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from users of this Site who are under 13 years of age. No personally-identifiable information should be submitted to, or posted at, this Site by visitors under 13 years of age without the prior written consent of their parent or guardian.
If we receive an e-mail message from a child who discloses, or is otherwise known to us, to be under 13 years of age, we may, without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian:
Respond to a one-time request from the child;
Provide notice of the child’s communication to the child’s parent or guardian;
Use this information as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the child on this Site; or
Send our electronic periodical publications and materials, with the notification to the child’s parent or guardian and the opportunity to discontinue any future delivery of the above information.
Any parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided personally-identifiable information to us may request a description of the personally-identifiable information that has been collected from or about that child, and either limit or restrict any further maintenance or use of such information from that child and/or direct us to delete it. Also, a parent may decline to allow any future collection of personally-identifiable information from that child. Such requests can be made by contacting us at URMclient@emailcustomerservice.com. We will take reasonable measures to verify that the requesting party is, in fact, the parent or guardian of the child in question before providing a child’s personally-identifiable information to such person. A parent may also access the personally-identifiable information that has been collected by us through accessing the “Sign-in” area of that parent’s child’s account by logging into this Site with that child’s account name and password.
We will not knowingly use or disclose any personally-identifiable information of a child under 13 years of age for any purpose except as described above.
Information We Collect and How It Is Used
Types of Information We Collect
By accessing or using this Site, you may provide us with two types of information: personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of computer technology such as “cookies,” “web beacons” and/or “web logs.”
We may ask for, and use, certain personally-identifiable information for the purposes of providing services that you request; for example, when you place an order, participate in an activity, or contact us.
How We Use Your Personally-Identifiable Information
We may exchange, sell or rent your name and mailing address (but not your e-mail address or telephone number) with companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. We may also use your personally-identifiable information (including your telephone number) for our own marketing purposes, or for the purposes of promotions research or analysis. We may also use it to provide third parties with aggregate, anonymous statistical information about use of this Site. Further, we may disclose your personally-identifiable information to our agents or contractors for the purpose of their performing services for us (including such services as billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing, and promotions or marketing management). These service providers are restricted from using this information in any way other than to provide services for us, and they may not share or resell this information.
We may disclose your personally-identifiable information when we are required to do so by law; in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention or other legal actions; to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of this Site; to protect our rights and the rights and safety of the users of this Site or the public; or to limit our legal liability.
We comply fully with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act, and we do not send unsolicited e-mail. However, we reserve the right to contact you by e-mail with respect to your order of our products or services or your account. If you have registered for on-line discussions, e-mail newsletters, Email Edition of The Upper Room® daily devotional magazine, or other services, you may also receive e-mail specific to your participation in these activities.
How We Use Your Non-Personally-Identifiable Information
We use “cookies” to collect non-personally-identifiable information, on an aggregate basis, about how this Site is used. This information may include the date and time of visits to this Site and time spent on this Site. The use of “cookies” allows us to personalize your use of this Site and to provide greater convenience each time that you visit it. You may choose to disable “cookies” on your computer, block all “cookies”, or receive a warning before a “cookie” is stored on your computer (please consult instructions for your web browser). However, if you disable or block “cookies”, it is possible that some parts of this Site will not be accessible to you.
Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit this Site. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and version, which page of this Site and/or Services you use and when and how long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use this Site and Services, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Services.
Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties
Other websites may be accessible through this Site; the operators of these websites may collect personally-identifiable information about you. Their privacy practices are not covered by this Policy, and we are not responsible for these practices. Your use of third-party websites is at your own risk. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.
When you click on a third-party link displayed on this Site, this Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your personally-identifiable information will be handled on their website. The Services may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When you post to a message board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information you post is made publicly available on-line and you do so at your own risk.
Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information
Control of Your Information
You may access, update or delete your personally-identifiable information or modify your account preferences for the Services by accessing the “Sign in” area of the Services or by contacting us at URMclient@emailcustomerservice.com. Please note that when you delete your account, we may retain your account information for a reasonable period of time thereafter, for the purpose of internal account management and fraud prevention activities. Please also understand that, once deleted, your information may not be available on this Site but may remain stored indefinitely in our databases.
Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us
If you no longer want to receive our newsletter, e-mails or other announcements, you may unsubscribe from receiving any or all of these services by selecting “unsubscribe” in your account, writing to us at customerassistance@upperroom.org or replying to the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our e-mails. If you e-mail us to change your contact preferences, we will implement your requested changes within a reasonable amount of time. Please note that your requested changes will not be effective until we implement such changes. Please also note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.
Security
We endeavor to offer the most advanced security measures with respect to your personally-identifiable information. The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to personally-identifiable information to our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain this Site and the Services. All personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You can help protect your personally-identifiable information by using a combination of letters and numbers in your password, changing your password often, using a secure web browser, and signing off when you are finished with the use of this Site on a shared computer.
Your California Privacy Rights
Under the California Civil Code, residents of the State of California who have provided any personally-identifiable information to us have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom we have disclosed personally-identifiable information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request, please send an email to URMclient@emailcustomerservice.com or contact us at the address below.
European Commission's Directive on Data Protection: Safe Harbor
We adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles that were established by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission to comply with the European Commission's Directive on Data Protection. For more information on the Safe Harbor framework, visit the Department of Commerce’s website located at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
Dispute Resolution
Residents of the European Economic Area
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Policy, you may report your claim to the Data Protection Authority located in your jurisdiction.
Residents of a Country Outside of EEA
If you are a resident of a country outside of the European Economic Area, you also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Policy, you will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly with us. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, the parties shall join in mediation services in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee, U.S.A., with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover any attorney’s fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
