Mental Health AssessmentsA mental health assessment can provide an overall picture of how well you feel emotionally and how well you are able to think, reason and remember (in other words, assessing your cognitive function). The assessment includes social and biographical information as well. Clients will be asked questions both in writing and in person with a mental health therapist. During the assessment, a mental health therapist will ask questions about how the clients gets along with others, including their family and friends. Currently, Tubman Chrysalis Center does not offer psychological testing services. A mental health assessment is done to:
Find out about and check on mental health concerns, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and other common mental health concerns.
Help tell the difference between mental and physical health problems.
Evaluate a person who has been referred for mental health treatment because of problems at school, work, or home.
Check the mental health of a person who has been placed in an institution or arrested for a crime, such as drunken driving or physical abuse.
Mental health assessments are offered at Tubman Chrysalis Center and Harriet Tubman Center East. To find out more information or to learn the hours that mental health assessment services are available, call 612.870.2426.
