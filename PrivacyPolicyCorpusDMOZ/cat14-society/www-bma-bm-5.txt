The Authority seeks to ensure that entities operating in Bermuda have a good understanding of the nature of the Authority’s regulatory requirements and of the Authority’s approach in implementing the Act. The Authority has issued a number of Guidance Notes which are intended to provide information on the application of the Act and corresponding regulations.
The Authority’s guidance is of general application and seeks to take account of the wide diversity of institutions that may be licensed under the Act. Guidance notes reflect minimum standards that the Authority expects insurers and other relevant parties to observe. Guidance notes may be periodically updated, generally in consultation with industry.
If you have questions on this or other matter please email insuranceinfo@bma.bm. If your query relates to Guidance Notes, put “Insurance Guidance” in the title of your email.
