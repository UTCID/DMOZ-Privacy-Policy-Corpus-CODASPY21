Sciences Po (officially L’Institut des Etudes Politiques) has a unique place in higher education in France. It offers a more advanced, intensive program than other French universities, but is less demanding and easier on admissions than the “grandes écoles” (the specialized, elite schools at the pinnacle of France’s educational system). Its alumni include numerous French political leaders, including the three most recent presidents of France. Sciences Po graduates also head many of France’s largest companies. Its enrollment is currently 6,700 (including 2,200 foreign students).
