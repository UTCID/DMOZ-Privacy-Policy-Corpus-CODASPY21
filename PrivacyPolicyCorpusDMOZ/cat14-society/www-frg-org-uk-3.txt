At Family Rights Group’s telephony advice service we collect and use your personal information to:
help us to provide you with advice and information about the situation or difficulty you are facing
improve our service

Below you will find details of: the personal information that we ask for; how we use it; the lawful basis on which we collect and use your personal data; and information about your rights.

The information that we ask for
The information that we ask for
Information to help us provide you with advice
When you get advice via Family Rights Group’s telephone advice line, an adviser will ask you for information that is relevant to the situation that you are calling about. The lawful basis on which we will seek to collect this information from you is ‘legitimate interest’. However, if when you are describing the situation to a Family Rights Group adviser, you share relevant but especially sensitive information (e.g. about your health, race, ethnic origin, religion) this is known as ‘special category data’. In this situation the legal basis for Family Rights Group processing this information will usually be ‘social protection’ unless the information shared indicates an immediate threat to life and limb, in which case the legal basis for processing it will ‘vital interest’.
The information that an adviser will ask you for will include:
your name and contact details so that we can:
o send you follow up advice materials after your call (e.g. advice sheets)o identify the record relating to your call which will help advisers understand the background and the advice you have previously been given.
relevant personal information that will help us to provide you with the right information and advice for your situation.
We keep this information in a case record and an adviser will: explain this to you at an early stage of your call and confirm if you agree to a record being created (there is further information about how we use case records in the 'if we are concerned about your safety or the safety of someone else' tab below).
We will only ask for the personal information that we need and we will:
always let you decide what you're comfortable telling us about your situation
explain to you why we need the information that we ask you for and how we use your information
treat your information as confidential.
If there is certain information that you don’t want to give to us, you don’t have to. For example, if you want to stay anonymous we'll only record information about the problem you are calling about and make sure you're not identified.
Information to help us understand who is using our serviceAfter we have provided you with the advice that you need to help you with your situation, advisers will also usually ask you for some additional monitoring information. Collecting this kind of monitoring information helps us to understand more about who is using our advice service. If there is certain information that you don’t want to give us then you do not have to share this with the adviser.
The lawful basis on which we collect monitoring information is ‘legitimate interest’. If however, the monitoring information being sought is about whether you have a disability, or is about your ethnicity, then this is considered to be a more sensitive type of information known as ‘special category data’. The lawful basis for collecting and using that kind of more sensitive information is ‘consent’. An adviser will ask, and formally record, whether you consent to us collecting and recording that information about you. It is up to you whether you give your consent or not; you do not have to.
How we use your information
How we use your information
When we record and use your personal information we:
only access it when we have a good reason
only share what is necessary and relevant
don’t sell it to anyone.
The main reason we ask for your information is to help us to provide the most accurate information and advice to help you with your situation.
We will however also access your information:
for training and quality assurance purposes to help us to provide a high quality service
to look into complaints.
We will also access your information in order to help us understand more about families involved with the child welfare system and the difficulties that they face. This includes creating statistics and case studies about:
who is contacting us for advice and help
what problems families most commonly face.
This information is always anonymised - you can't be identified. We share this kind of information with funders, government departments and publicly in Family Rights Group reports, articles and presentations, press releases, social media and blogs. The statistics also inform our policy research, campaigns, or other media work.
Sharing information to help you further with your situation
Sharing information to help you further with your situation
If we are providing you with telephone advice as part of a specific indirect or self advocacy project that FRG is running, then we might also need to share some of your information with other organisations. For example:
within a letter to a children’s services department social worker or manager that you have asked us to write to on your behalf
in order to refer you to another organisation for specialist advice on an issue that we cannot assist you with.
We would only share your information in this way if you have given your permission for this to happen.Organisations we share your data with must store and use your data in line with data protection law.
Storing your information
Storing your information
During an advice call, advisers may take notes to assist in the conversation. These notes are shredded afterward.
When you receive advice and information from an adviser via the telephone (or in writing by post or email as part of any follow-up advice being provided to you) our adviser will enter information about your situation and the help you need into our secure case management system.
This means that we can keep the information you provide to us, see the history and main details of your case, as well as the advice the adviser has given to you.
Doing this helps us to provide accurate information and advice and support to you including if you receive advice from us on a number of occasions.
Some of your information might also be kept within our secure email and IT systems.
Monitoring the quality of our service
Monitoring the quality of our service
With your permission, we may contact you so that you can provide feedback on our service, for example via a survey.
When you call our national telephone advice line, we will not record your call. However, from time to time a member of the advice service team (e.g. a manager) or external accreditation body may listen in to a call for training or quality assurance purposes.
You will always be informed if someone wants to listen in for this reason and you will be told about this before any personal data collection takes place. Listening in to a call will then only happen if you give your permission.
If we are concerned about your safety or the safety of someone else
If we are concerned about your safety or the safety of someone else
If something you've told us makes us think that either:
a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm and that the relevant statutory agencies are unaware; or
you or another adult is at serious risk of harm
then we will consider whether there is a need to breach confidentiality and share that information with a statutory agency (e.g. children’s services, adult social services).
You can find full information about this in our Confidentiality and protection of children and vulnerable adults policy.
