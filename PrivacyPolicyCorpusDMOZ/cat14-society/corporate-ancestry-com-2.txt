Our Story
We help unlock new understanding and meaningful connections.
Our story begins with you.
A deeper understanding of your heritage, history and health sheds light on who you are and can strengthen your identity and sense of belonging. That’s why Ancestry® combines billions of rich historical records, millions of family trees and samples from millions of people in the AncestryDNA® network to help you discover your unique place in history and gain meaningful, actionable insights that can impact your future.
How we do it:
When it comes to family history and consumer genomics, Ancestry® leads in resources and innovation. For more than 30 years, we’ve been using cutting-edge technologies to enable discoveries that enrich lives. Through ongoing innovation in DNA science, digitizing historical records and automating research, we help customers create a more complete family portrait that continually yields new discoveries as science and technology advances.
Investing in your journey.
Over the past two decades, Ancestry® has invested over $300 million to build the world’s largest, most distinguished collection of family history records, and we’re continuing to invest in new content collections globally. We also remain committed to creating the best products and services in genomics by developing tools that help you make discoveries more easily and by using the latest science to help you gain valuable insights about your origins and common, actionable health conditions.
A legacy of trust.
Our customers have trusted us with personal information for many decades—and we’re committed to helping ensure you feel just as secure today. Whether it’s your family history or your DNA data, we always strive to manage your personal information with integrity and respect. Visit our Privacy Center to learn more about how we protect your privacy and keep it at the core of what we do every day.
