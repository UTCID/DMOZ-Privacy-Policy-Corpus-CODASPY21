Privacy Notice for Job Applicants
Privacy Notice for Job Applicants
Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. It explains why and how we collect your personal data, how we protect these and for how long we retain these. We keep your data as safe and secure as reasonably possible protecting these against loss and unauthorised disclosure or access and we will handle your personal data in strict compliance with applicable data protection laws, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 (‘GDPR’).
This Privacy Notice has been set up as a Q&A (‘Questions & Answers’) list.
1. Who will process my personal data?
The ‘Data Controller’ of your personal data will be the following legal entity:
Ius Laboris International Employment Law, Pensions and Employee Benefits Alliance Scrl
Boulevard du Souverain 280
1160 Auderghem
Company number: 0473.896.171
info@iuslaboris.com
We will refer to Ius Laboris International Employment Law, Pensions and Employee Benefits Alliance cvba as ‘Ius Laboris’ hereafter.
2. What is the purpose and legal ground for processing my personal data?
The purpose of processing your personal data is to register your application for a job with us and include it in our selection procedure. We will make a profile of you, meaning that Ius Laboris will process all the data required for us to assess your job application. This may involve an assessment by a third party.
The processing of your data is therefore necessary in order to take steps prior to entering into an employment contract and is in Ius Laboris’ legitimate interests, i.e. the interest to assess you before deciding to offer you employment, which is also in your interests or at least these do not outweigh our interests.
If we decide to hire you, we will also use your personal data to prepare an employment contract.
If we decide not to hire you, we will retain your personal data for a period of time as well (see 7) in order to be able to contact you if any future job opportunities match your profile. This is also in the legitimate interests of Ius Laboris.
3. Which categories of personal data will be processed?
Personal data is all information relating to you or on the basis of which you may be identified. Anonymous data, without possibility to identify you, could thus not be considered as personal data.
For the purposes referred to here above, the processing of personal data will include the following:
standard data related to your identity (surname, name(s), address, …);
personal data (date and place of birth, nationality, gender, phone number, email address, hobbies and interests, …);
your picture if you give it to us on a voluntary basis (e.g. included in your CV);
data with regard to your professional experience (profile, data on previous employers, termination of last employments and work carried out, special projects, …), including reference checks if you have provided us with references in your CV;
data with regard to your education (diploma’s, certificates, internships, special trainings, …);
language skills;
if applicable, whether you possess a permit of working and/or reside in the European Economic Area (EEA);
any other personal data that you present us with as part of your application, in your CV or motivation letter, related to the exercise of the role;
digital assessment through the internet (social media presence), insofar as this presence is open for us to see;
any other personal data (than mentioned above) that require processing by virtue of the law.
You are not required to provide us with these data. However, not doing so might adversely affect your chances of recruitment.
4. Who will have access to my personal data?
Ius Laboris administration and management will have access to your personal data on a strict ‘need-to-know’ basis for the purposes described above.
We do not pass on your information to any other third party.
5. Will my personal data be transferred outside my country of residence?
No, personal data of applicants is not transferred outside of the EEA. If it is, you will be asked for your consent.
6. Will Ius Laboris make use of automated decision-making?
Automated decisions are defined as decisions about individuals that are based solely on the automated processing of data and that produce legal effects or that significantly affect the individuals involved.
As a rule, Ius Laboris does not make use of automated decision-making as described above. Ius Laboris does not base its decision whether or not to hire you solely on automated processing of your personal data.
7. How long will my personal data be retained?
We will only hold your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes described above. In case the recruitment does not result in an employment relationship, your personal data will be retained for a maximum period of three years after the end of the job application procedure for the purposes described under 2.
8. What are my rights with regard to the processing of my personal data by Ius Laboris and who can I contact?
You have at any time the possibility to contact Ius Laboris should you need any support while applying or managing your personal data. Additionally, you have at any time the right to contact Ius Laboris if you want to:
Access your personal data. This includes the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing to the extent that this would not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others;
Rectify your inaccurate personal data including supplementing incomplete data;
Erase your personal data if there is no (longer a) lawful ground for us to process it;
Transfer your personal data (= to obtain them in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format) insofar we process them in an automated way related to your employment contract (‘Contract’) or the prior steps thereto and insofar this does not affect the rights and freedoms of others, such as for example your colleagues;
Restrict your personal data if you were to object to the processing or to the accuracy of the processed data or if you wish to retain certain personal data in the context of a possible claim while Ius Laboris no longer needs the data in the light of the purposes mentioned under point 2.
You have at any time the right to object to the processing for which Ius Laboris bases itself in point 2 on the legitimate interest. Ius Laboris will then cease the processing unless it has compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.
In addition, you also have the right - if you feel that Ius Laboris did not act in line with data protection legislation - to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, of your place of work or of the place of the alleged infringement.
If you would like to receive more information on the processing of your data, your rights or explanation of this Privacy Notice, you can always contact us. Your contact at Ius Laboris for any further information about these rights is:
