TIMSLAW.COM PRIVACY POLICY
TimsLaw.com does not require any personal information from visitors.
COOKIES: The software that runs TimsLaw.com sets cookies. These cookies are not put to any use, as far as TimsLaw.com knows. TimsLaw.com wishes the software did not set cookies, but cannot seem to turn off cookie setting. The site will run fine if you disable cookies.
LOG FILES: TimsLaw.com, as do almost ALL websites, keeps a
Log File of the internet addresses of visitors, and the pages they view. Our IP addresses are not secrets, and every website we visit knows our internet addresses. If you have a static IP address, you are much more identifiable than if you have a dynamic IP address. WARNING:
IF YOU SURF FROM WORK,
YOUR IP ADDRESS MIGHT CONTAIN THE NAME OF YOUR COMPANY !!!!!!!!!!!
LOG FILE CONTAINS SEARCH TERMS: TimsLaw.com maintains a list, in the Log File, of the search phrases visitors put into search engines such as Google in order to find www.TimsLaw.com. For example, Google sends your search phrase to
TimsLaw.com when you click on a Google search result — all search engines send the search phrases to the websites they refer to in their search results. TimsLaw.com also keeps a list of the search terms that users input into the search box on the TimsLaw.com site, in the log file.
STATISTICS SCRIPTS: TimsLaw.com participates in several internet statistical services that attempt to determine how many visitors the site gets, where they come from, and possibly other statistics. It’s speculated that these statistical services try to deduce things about visitors based on their IP addresses and search terms, although the services do not publicize their methodology. These services operate through tiny JavaScript code snippets on the the TimsLaw.com webpages. Some services use 1pixel clear image-links, called “web bugs”, so that every webpage viewed will result in the downloading of a 1pixel clear image (and thereby reveal the visitor’s IP address). Google Analytics service is the primary service TimsLaw.com uses, but there will be others, including Quantcast.
USE OF LOGFILES: The logfiles may be used for any lawful purpose.
