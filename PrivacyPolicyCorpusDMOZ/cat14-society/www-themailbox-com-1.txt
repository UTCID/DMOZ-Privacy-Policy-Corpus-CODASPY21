Infobase Holdings, Inc. is committed to honoring your privacy and improving your online experience. When you register for our site, you provide us with information, such as your name, email address, and interests. We ask for this in connection with registrations, promotions, and purchases so that we can tell you about upcoming features and products that you might be interested in.
When you registered with us, you also let us know your preferences regarding receiving email from us as well as other companies that offer services for teachers. We honor your preferences, and you may alter them anytime by updating your information on our site.
In an effort to improve your online experience, we use technology called a “cookie.” This cookie is for log-in purposes only. It is not used to collect any personal information. When you log in for the first time, it leaves bits of information on your computer so that you will automatically be logged in on return visits. However, you will need to enter your user name and password whenever you access your personal information.
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input when completing a purchase. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Rest assured that any information we store for you, whether at registration or with the cookie, will be treated with the same respect that you’ve come to know from your friends at The Mailbox.
