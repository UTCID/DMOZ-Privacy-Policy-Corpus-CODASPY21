Global Outreach International Privacy Policy
Effective Friday, May 25, 2018
This privacy policy explains what information we collect about you (the “user”) and how we use it. We take your privacy and data security very seriously.
Global Outreach International (“GO”) is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit registered in the United States. We are a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability and believe in transparency as a core value. Finally, as a Christian organization, we strive to practice other-mindedness (Phil. 2) in every aspect of how we interact with website users, donors, volunteers, staff members, missionaries, and short term mission trip participants.
You have the right to contact Global Outreach by email (hello@globaloutreach.org) or phone (662.842.4615) or by physical mail (PO Box 1, Tupelo, MS 38802) to ask for a full review of your donor record and how your information has been used. You have the right to opt out of all communication (print, email, or phone), or to opt out of only Home Office communication (staying opted-in to communication regarding specific missionaries or projects). GO honors all opt-out requests within three (3) business days.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Our website (globaloutreach.org) uses cookies and stores your IP address for the purpose of identifying whether you are a registered user and whether you have been to the website previously. These things create a smoother search and giving experience. Your IP address is not connected with personally identifiable data unless you have voluntarily provided such data by (1) making a donation and/or (2) creating a user account. Our website complies with all Do Not Track (DNT) requests and uses SSL encryption for a safe and secure browsing experience. Global Outreach does not sell, lease, or allow third party access to any of your data for any reason. We do not make money off your data and we do not use targeted advertisements on our website.
There are three main ways GO receives personally identifiable data about you; these will each be discussed in more detail below:
- donation processing;
- short term mission trips;
- missionary newsletter mailing list additions.
Donation processing
Global Outreach uses two main systems when processing your donations. Site Stacker is the donor and data management platform that powers our website. When you give a donation, you voluntarily provide personal and financial information that is stored on a server which allows us to process, receive, and correctly allocate the funds you’ve designated. Site Stacker uses cookies and your computer’s IP address to determine whether you’ve been to the site before, which makes it easier and faster to make another donation. If you create an account on our website, you can store payment methods (which are privately encrypted on Site Stacker servers), addresses, and contact information. Your account is password-protected and your contact information is only accessed inside Site Stacker if you contact us asking for help with your account.
Our financial processing services are provided by Bank of America using FirstData for credit / debit card processing and Telecheck for ACH / EFT (direct bank account) processing. These three services are PCI compliant and maintain industry-standard levels of encryption and privacy protection.
We also receive mailed donations, PayPal transfers, cash gifts, and sometimes non-cash gifts such as stocks or physical goods. We collect personal information as required by US law to allow for maximum compliance with the tax code and to ensure we can properly issue receipts.
Your contact information (which includes phone numbers, email, mailing address, and occasionally demographic information such as marital status and date of birth) is stored on encrypted servers and accessed using a program called Raiser’s Edge. This program, in conjunction with an accounting program called Financial Edge, allows us to maintain donation history (in compliance with US law), issue accurate receipts, comply with strict annual financial audits, and maintain print and electronic communication on behalf of both missionaries and the Home Office.
Short term mission trips
Participants on short-term mission trips voluntarily fill out a detailed application that includes basic biographical information, liability release forms, and a color copy of a passport. GO takes several steps to ensure this personally identifiable information is kept safe and secure. We do not share, lease, or sell this information to anyone.
Missionary newsletter mailing lists
When missionaries join Global Outreach International, they go through a Missionary Orientation Process (MOP) and week-long Missionary Orientation Training (MOT) at our global headquarters in Tupelo, Mississippi. As part of this process, missionary candidates provide a list of names (“constituents”), email addresses, and mailing addresses to our database that becomes the basis for their print and digital newsletter. It is understood that missionaries provide names of people who have expressed a desire to opt-in to receiving print and/or digital communication from them regarding their ministry.
These constituents have the right to opt out of communication at any time. They have the right to contact the Home Office by email (hello@globaloutreach.org) or phone (662.842.4615) or by physical mail (PO Box 1, Tupelo, MS 38802) to request the status of their constituent record (i.e., to ask in what ways their information is stored and used in our database) and to opt out of any or all mailings, emails, and phone communication if they so choose.
GO reserves the right to contact these constituents from time to time with information and appeals concerning broader organizational needs and priorities, which may or may not be directly related to the missionary who provided their names in the first place. Constituents may opt out of these communications at any time without affecting their ability to remain opted-in to receiving print or digital communication from any missionary or regarding any project that is managed in our database.
HOW DOES GLOBAL OUTREACH USE YOUR INFORMATION?
Global Outreach uses your information for any combination of the following:
to mail a physical newsletter to you on behalf of a missionary on whose mailing list you appear;
to mail you other Global Outreach physical mailings, including but not necessarily limited to: requests for donations, newsletters, postcards, event invitations and reminders, informational brochures, and other resources;
to send you emails for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to fundraising campaigns, event invitations and reminders, resources, stories, videos, etc.;
if you are a participant in a short-term missions trip, this could include coordinating with a travel insurance company to write and issue trip insurance, coordinating airfare, submitting a background check, communicating about trip deadlines and administrative details, etc.;
to notify you in print or online of annual Members’ Meetings, including proposed business that requires a vote, per our bylaws and the State of Mississippi;
to call you to say “thank you” or offer information about events, fundraising campaigns, etc.
You may opt out of any or all communication at any time by email (hello@globaloutreach.org) or phone (662.842.4615) or by physical mail (PO Box 1, Tupelo, MS 38802).
