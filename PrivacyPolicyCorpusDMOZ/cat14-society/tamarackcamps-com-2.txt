XIV. Posting Guidelines – FAS User Conduct Guidelines.
You must at all times use FAS in a responsible and legal manner.  We trust you to be responsible, and thousands of other users respect that trust.  The following is a list of guidelines we expect you to follow as you post in the Communication Media and submit content elsewhere on the FAS site.
No illegal content.
No foul, rude, or abusive language.  We are trying to maintain a family environment and such language is not appropriate or necessary.
Do not misrepresent your identity or your affiliation with any person, nonprofit, organization, or business.
Do not send junk email or spam to people who do not wish to receive mail from you.  This includes conducting, displaying, promoting or forwarding surveys, contests, raffles, lotteries, pyramid schemes or chain letters to FAS Users, whether or not such activity is generated on the FAS Website.
You may not collect or store personal data about other Users including email addresses except where expressly authorized to do so.
We encourage free speech and defend everyone’s right to express unpopular points of view.  But, we don’t permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, and sexual orientation/gender identity).  Content with racist or extremist comments or content are not allowed.  This includes links to sites with such content.
Actions like predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people’s personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts, crimes, or to violate the Terms of Use are taken very seriously at FAS.  Anyone caught doing these activities may be permanently banned from FAS and may be reported to law enforcement.
Unsolicited posts by companies and/or individuals promoting themselves, a website, or a product are not allowed.
XV. Children’s Access to the Website
If you are under the age of 13, we ask that you only access our site when accompanied by your parent or guardian.  FAS will not request any information from a person younger than age 13, in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and will not knowingly accept personal information from a child younger than age 13 for any purpose.  We may ask for your year of birth to verify age, Alumni status, and other camp-related purposes.
We Enforce These Guidelines
FAS staff periodically reviews content to determine whether it violates the Terms of Use.  However, FAS does not and cannot review all information and materials that may be viewed on the Website.   You acknowledge that FAS is acting as a conduit by allowing you to submit and view materials through the Website and is not liable for any content viewed through the Website.  When FAS reviews inappropriate content, FAS removes them if deemed appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion.

Maddie, Camp Maas Counselor
My happiest memories were my summers at Tamarack. Everyone who stood up in my wedding were friends I met during my camp days.
Jeff, Tamarack Alumnus
My child came home and would have liked to get right back on the bus to go back! He talked about how much he loved his counselors and the friends he made. It was a great summer for him.
Lauren, Happy Tamarack Parent
Living technology-free and in the woods helped to build a sense of rugged, pure community. The bonds created between campers and staff, memories made, and adventures had are like no other. I am beyond grateful for my Kennedy experience, and I can truly say that it changed my life.
Anna, Kennedy Camper
As my daughter wrote in her last letter home  I have never been more happy! You can’t ask for anything more! Camp truly is the greatest place.
Sandy, Camp Maas Parent
It is amazing to watch your campers grow up and enjoy the same magic that you did as a camper!
Noah, Camp Maas Supervisor
I love camp and its incredible people. I made great friends and only have wonderful memories!

Proud Agree Parent
As an alumni and now a parent, I wouldn’t want my kids anywhere else. They look forward to their time at camp for 340 days of the year! Thank You!
Sarah, Tamarack Parent & Alumnus
