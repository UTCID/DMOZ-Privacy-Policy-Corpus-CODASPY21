Credit Card Transactions
For your protection, we have taken a number of steps to maximize the security of financial transactions that are accepted on the Facts and Logic About the Middle East, Inc. website. Credit Card processing is accomplished using secure processing services.  Your entry of credit card information is encrypted when transmitted in secure mode.  If you are behind a firewall, the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) feature of your browser and the processing of the credit card may be blocked. In this case, you have the option of credit card processing without SSL by selecting the “Non-Secure” feature on the screen — the choice is up to you.
If for any reason, you still feel uncomfortable submitting your credit card over the Internet, you can mail your credit card form to us.
Using Encryption
In certain transactions you are given the option of running in a secure (SSL) mode or unsecured mode. In cases where a firewall is causing a situation that cannot be corrected, the use of the unsecured mode is given. The unsecured mode is used by you at your own risk.
In addition, there are constantly changing restrictions in the use of encryption software and schemes that are used in various countries. The use of appropriate software and encryption options are your responsibility, and Factsandlogic.org assumes no risk or liability in ensuring your compliance to local law.
REGARDLESS OF THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN BY YOU OR BY FACTS AND LOGIC ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, INC., PERFECT SECURITY DOES NOT EXIST ON THE INTERNET. FLAME CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO THIS SITE OR FLAME, AND YOU TRANSMIT SUCH INFORMATION AT YOUR OWN RISK.
