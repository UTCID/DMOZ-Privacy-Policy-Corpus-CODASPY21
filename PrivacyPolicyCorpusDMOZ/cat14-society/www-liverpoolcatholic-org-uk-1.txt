LIVERPOOL ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESAN TRUSTEES INCORPORATED
Date: July 2018
Review Date: May 2020
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Liverpool Roman Catholic Archdiocesan Trustees Incorporated (the "Archdiocese") is a charity registered with the Charity Commission in England and Wales. Our charity number is 232709 and our registered address is Liverpool Archdiocese Centre for Evangelisation, Croxteth Drive, Liverpool, L17 1AA. In this Notice, references to 'we' and 'us' mean the Liverpool Roman Catholic Archdiocese.
1.2 When you provide us with Personal Data in order to engage with us and/or benefit from our activities, we will keep a record of the data you give to us in order to enable us to comply with our statutory obligations and to achieve our charitable objects of advancing and maintaining the Roman Catholic religion through the operation of our parishes and our other activities.
1.3 For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/279 (GDPR), the Archdiocese through its Trust Board will be a Data Controller in respect of your Personal Data. In some cases, the Archdiocese may be a joint Data Controller of your Personal Data (e.g. where your data is shared between the Archdiocese and another organisation for a particular purpose). Please be aware that our parishes form part of the Archdiocese and are not separate legal entities. Parishes are not Data Controllers, nor do they process Personal Data on behalf of the Archdiocese as a Data Processor.
1.4 Everyone has rights with regard to how their Personal Data is handled by organisations. The Archdiocese is committed to ensuring that Personal Data is properly and securely managed in accordance with the relevant data protection laws and believes this is an important part of achieving trust and confidence between the Archdiocese and those with whom it interacts. Please read this Notice to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or that we obtain or hold about you, and to understand what your rights are in relation to information that we hold. This Notice applies to information about living identifiable individuals only.

3 HOW AND WHY DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
3.1 The Personal Data which we hold about you, whether it is collected directly from you or whether we receive it from a third party, may be Processed in a number of ways, for example:
3.1.1 to communicate with you in relation to news about or activities and events taking place in the Archdiocese or in any Archdiocesan parish, including seeking feedback and informing you of any changes to our activities;

3.2 Any information gathered through cookies and similar technologies via the Archdiocesan website or the website of any parish, is used to measure and analyse information on visits to the website, to tailor the website to make it better for visitors and to improve technical performance.

4 ON WHAT GROUNDS DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
4.1 We must have a lawful basis for Processing your information; this will vary according to the circumstances of how and why we have your information but typical examples include:
4.1.1 the activities are within our legitimate interests in advancing and maintaining the Roman Catholic religion, in providing information about the activities of the Archdiocese or any Archdiocesan parish, and to raise charitable funds (e.g. where we use baptism data to follow up with families for sacraments);

4.1.5 the Processing is necessary for carrying out a task in the public interest (e.g. updating and maintaining the register of marriages);
4.1.6 to protect your vital interests (e.g. if you were unfortunate enough to fall ill or suffer an injury on our premises, then we may pass on information to the NHS for treatment purposes and to family members).
4.2 If we Process any Special Categories of Personal Data we must have a further lawful basis for the processing. This may include:

4.3 If we Process any Personal Data comprising criminal convictions or offences we must also have a further lawful basis for the processing. This may include:
4.3.1 where the Archdiocese is exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on us or you in connection with employment, social security or social protection and the Archdiocese has an appropriate policy document in place (e.g. to undertake appropriate checks on individuals prior to taking up a role);

4.3.4 where it is carried out in the course of safeguarding children or other individuals at risk e.g. making a safeguarding disclosure;
4.3.5 where an individual has given their consent to the processing;
4.3.6 where the Archdiocese is establishing, exercising or defending legal claims (e.g. providing information to our insurers or lawyers in connection with legal proceedings);
4.3.7 where it is necessary to protect the vital interests of an individual (e.g. passing on information to the Police); or
4.3.8 where it is carried out in the course of the Archdiocese's legitimate activities as a not-for-profit body with religious aims (e.g. carrying out pastoral activities).
5 WHO WILL WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?
5.1 We will only use your Personal Data within the Archdiocese for the purposes for which it was obtained, unless you have explicitly agreed that we may share your Personal Data with another organisation or unless we are otherwise permitted or required to under the Data Protection Rules or order of a Court or other competent regulatory body or as set out in this Notice.

5.3 We may share your information with government bodies for tax purposes or law enforcement agencies for the prevention and detection of crime.
5.4 Sometimes the Archdiocese contracts with third parties whom we ask to Process Personal Data on our behalf (e.g. IT consultants, distributors of parish newsletters and directories). We require these third parties to comply strictly with our instructions and with the GDPR.
5.5 We also may be required to share your Personal Data so that the Archdiocese can benefit from Gift Aid nominations you have made e.g. with HMRC.
5.6 We have in place administrative, technical and physical measures designed to guard against and minimise the risk of loss, misuse or unauthorised processing or disclosure of the Personal Data that we hold.
5.7 In the course of Processing your Personal Data, or disclosing it to the recipients referred to above, we may transfer it to countries which are outside the European Economic Area (EEA), some of which may not have laws which provide the same level of protection to your Personal Data as laws inside the EEA. In such cases we will take steps to ensure that the transfers comply with the GDPR and that your Personal Data is appropriately protected.
6 HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR?
6.1 Your information will be kept in accordance with our Record Retention Schedule, copies of which are available from the Data Protection Officer. In any event, we will endeavour to only keep Personal Data for as long as is necessary and to delete it when it is no longer so.

12 GLOSSARY
"Data Controller" means a person, organisation or body that determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any Personal Data is processed. A Data Controller is responsible for complying with the data protection laws including the GDPR and establishing practices and policies in line with them.
"Data Processor" means any person, organisation or body that Processes personal data on behalf of and on the instruction of the Archdiocese. Data Processors have a duty to protect the information they process by following data protection laws.
"Data Subject" means a living individual about whom the Archdiocese processes Personal Data and who can be identified from the Personal Data. A Data Subject need not be a UK national or resident. All Data Subjects have legal rights in relation to their Personal Data and the information that the Archdiocese holds about them.
"Personal Data" means any information relating to a living individual who can be identified from that information or in conjunction with other information which is in, or is likely to come into, the Archdiocese’s possession. Personal Data can be factual (such as a name, address or date of birth) or it can be an opinion (e.g. a performance appraisal). It can even include a simple email address. A mere mention of someone's name in a document does not necessarily constitute Personal Data, but personal details such as someone's contact details or salary (if it enabled an individual to be identified) would fall within the definition.
"Processing" means any activity that involves use of Personal Data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the information or carrying out any operation or set of operations on it, including organising, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring or disclosing Personal Data to third parties.
"Special Categories of Personal Data" (previously called sensitive personal data) means information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition or sexuality. It also includes genetic and biometric data. Special Categories of Personal Data can only be processed under strict conditions and such processing will usually, although not always, require the explicit consent of the Data Subject.
