Midhurst Parish Church takes its duty to ensure the safety of everyone with whom it interacts very seriously , and especially in its work with children and vulnerable adults. It follows the Church of England’s safeguarding practices, and has recently completed the ” Simple Quality Protects” quality assurance scheme required by Chichester Diocese. In particular Midhurst Church ensures that everyone who should be is”security checked” (DBSd), and that appropriate levels (C1 and C2) of safeguarding training are undertaken.
The Church’s policy on safeguarding is listed below, and is reviewed and discussed annually by the Parochial Church Council (PCC). There then follows the list of contacts both within the parish, within the Diocese and nationally if anyone had a concern they wanted to take up.
Finally, also included is the Diocesan “whistleblowing policy” if anyone is deeply concerned about an incident affecting an individual, or practice they deem of concern.
We hope that by being careful and vigilant in this area we take care of everyone, and we can then all enjoy the experience of Church life.
