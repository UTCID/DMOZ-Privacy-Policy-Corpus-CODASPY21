St Albright's Media Policy
Consent Policy - Media
Your privacy is important to us, and we want to communicate with you in a way which has your consent, and which is in line with UK law on data protection. As a result of a change in UK law, we now need your consent to how we use your media.
By agreeing to this policy, you are giving consent to the Priest in charge and The PCC of St Albright’s Church, Stanway to use photographs and videos of church events on St Albright’s website, on facebook, in St Albright’s newsletter and on church premises.
I consent to St Albright’s church uploading, processing and using photo or video footage of me for promotional purposes in relation to events, services and the church newsletter.
Where you do not grant consent we will not be able to use your personal data; except in certain limited situations, such as where required to do so by law or to protect members of the public from serious harm.
Consent can be withdrawn or changed at any time by contacting St Albright’s Church, London Road, Stanway, Colchester, CO3 8LT or by emailing Rev. Tony Bushell, our Priest-in-Charge - vicar@stalbrights.org
Please note that all processing and use of your personal media files will cease once you have withdrawn consent, other than where this is required by law, but this will not affect any media that has already been processed prior to this point.
