Donor Privacy Policy
The Atlanta Children’s Shelter is committed to preserving the privacy of its donors and volunteers, and safeguarding their information.  The following statement describes how donor and volunteer information is protected.
ACS does not sell, loan, or trade names or other personal data on its donors or volunteers nor do we maintain any credit card information.  Credit card donations are processed exclusively by Network for Good. Network for Good is committed to providing safe, secure and private online transactions.  For further details about their privacy practices, please consult their privacy and security policy directly at www.networkforgood.org.
When a donation is made in person, via mail, or through our website we receive and use donor contact information (name, address and e-mail address) so that we can provide the donor with an acknowledgement letter for tax purposes.  We maintain this information in our database of supporters in order to keep you abreast of our work and related issues that may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive materials (such as the quarterly Newsletter) from us, you can send an email to info@acsatl.org and we will remove you from our mailing lists.
ACS uses additional web-based fundraising platforms during off-site events to collect donations and facilitate ACS event registrations and activities.   Our donor privacy policy applies to all of these platforms. The following platforms may be used at these events:
Square                 https://squareup.com/legal/privacy-no-account
