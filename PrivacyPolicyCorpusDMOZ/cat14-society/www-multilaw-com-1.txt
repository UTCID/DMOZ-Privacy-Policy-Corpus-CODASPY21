Multilaw’s Contact to those who are Member Firm Personnel or registered to attend Multilaw events
Where you are personnel of a Multilaw Member Firm and sign up for a Multilaw account, you may receive information relevant to your Member Firm’s membership of Multilaw. This will be especially relevant where you are a contact partner for your Member Firm, office holder or committee member with Multilaw (for example, through chairing or being a member of a practice group, participating in Multilaw’s appraisal committee, or a member of Multilaw’s executive committee or board). Multilaw will also contact you where you register to attend a conference (including Regional Meetings and the Multilaw Academy), in relation to the event and follow up, as well as for Academy alumni communications. Multilaw may also send communications to you in accordance with your preferences or participation within Multilaw practice and community
groups.
Multilaw will contact you on the basis that it is in our legitimate interests to do so in relation to your role, services you provide to Multilaw, in order to maximise your Membem to enable you to attend the Multilaw conference. You have the right to restrict or object to this type of processing, and should you wish to do so please contact us at data@multilaw.com.
