Privacy and Cybersecurity Section
July 29, 2019 -- Responding to the needs of lawyers in California and across the country, the Board of Trustees for the Los Angeles County Bar Association (LACBA) has approved a new law practice section specifically focused on Privacy and Cybersecurity.
Former Trustee and founding member of the new section Tanya Forsheit added, "We are thrilled with LACBA’s enthusiastic response to this new and critical law practice section. California is at the forefront of data privacy and cybersecurity law. There are hundreds of lawyers in Los Angeles County, in the public and private sectors, working in corporations and firms, on the plaintiff and defense side, who are advising clients in these areas on a daily basis. The section will provide those lawyers with a forum for networking, sharing insights, and discussing ways of tackling new and cutting-edge legal problems."
The Executive Committee for the section includes several attorneys who have been named as leading privacy and cybersecurity practitioners in the state, senior partners from some of the largest firms in Los Angeles, sole practitioners, representatives from the Cyber & Intellectual Property Crimes Section of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California, and academics.
As the largest voluntary bar association in California, LACBA has a 140-year legacy and responsibility to our members and the community to be a leader on issues and trends that are shaping the future of law and society. This new section joins LACBA’s other 25 law practice sections and will offer quarterly programming beginning this fall on issues of cybercrimes, the California Consumer Privacy Act, national security, and international developments. The section will also engage in law student outreach events on campuses, will put on informal networking events, and will develop a mentorship program pairing senior and junior members of the section, as well as with law students and junior practitioners seeking to transition into this practice area.
If you have questions about this new section, please contact Tanya Forsheit at TForsheit@fkks.com.
