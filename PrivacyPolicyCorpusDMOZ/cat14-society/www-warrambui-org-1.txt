YOUR PRIVACY
Last updated: 2 May 2019
At Warrambui Retreat and Conference Centre (www.warrambui.com.au), we are
committed to protecting your privacy as a customer and an online visitor to our
website. We use the information we collect about you to maximize the services
that we provide to you. We respect the privacy and confidentiality of the
information provided by you and adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles.
Please read our privacy policy below carefully.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
In the course of your visits to our website or use of our products and
services, we may obtain the following information about you: name, company
name, email address, telephone number, credit card details, billing address,
geographic location, IP address, survey responses, support queries, blog
comments and social media handles (together ‘Personal Data’).
Our services are not directed to persons under 18 and we do not knowingly
collect Personal Data from anyone under 18. If we become aware that a child
under 18 has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete that information as
quickly as possible. If you are the parent or guardian of a child and you
believe they have provided us with Personal Data without your consent, then
please contact us.
You can review, correct, update or delete your Personal Data by either logging
into your account and making the changes yourself or contacting us directly to
do so.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
Personally Identifiable Information: We use the information we collect to
deliver our services to you, including: communicating with you, providing
technical support, notifying you of updates and offers, sharing useful content,
measuring customer satisfaction, diagnosing problems and providing you with a
personalised website experience.
Marketing communications are only sent to you if you have requested or
subscribed to them. You can opt out of our marketing communications at any time
by unsubscribing or emailing us and your request will be actioned immediately.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We also use the information we collect
in aggregated and anonymized forms to improve our services, including:
administering our website, producing reports and analytics, advertising our
products and services, identifying user demands and assisting in meeting
customer needs generally.
Any information you choose to make publicly available, such as blog comments
and testimonials on our website, will be available for others to see. If you
subsequently remove this information, copies may remain viewable in cached and
archived pages on other websites or if others have copied or saved the
information.
STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
We will use all reasonable means to protect the confidentiality of your
Personal Data while in our possession or control. All information we receive from
you is stored and protected on our secure servers from unauthorized use or
access. Credit card information is encrypted before transmission and is not
stored by us on our servers.
To enable us to deliver our services, we may transfer information that we
collect about you, including Personal Data, across borders for storage and
processing in countries other than Australia. If your Personal Data is
transferred and processed outside Australia, it will only be transferred to
countries that have adequate privacy protections.
We retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide services
to you and as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
disputes and enforce our agreements.
In the event there is a breach of our security and your Personal Data is
compromised, we will promptly notify you in compliance with the applicable law.
COOKIES AND PIXELS
A cookie is a small file placed in your web browser that collects information
about your web browsing behaviour. Use of cookies allows a website to tailor
its configuration to your needs and preferences. Cookies do not access
information stored on your computer or any Personal Data (e.g. name, address,
email address or telephone number). Most web browsers automatically accept cookies
but you can choose to reject cookies by changing your browser settings. This
may, however, prevent you from taking full advantage of our website.
Our website uses cookies to analyse website traffic, provide social media
sharing and liking functionality and help us provide a better website visitor
experience. In addition, cookies and pixels may be used to serve relevant ads
to website visitors through third party services such as Google Adwords and
Facebook Adverts. These ads may appear on this website or other websites you
visit.
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
We do not and will not sell or deal in Personal Data or any customer
information.
Your Personal Data details are only disclosed to third party suppliers when it
is required by law, for goods or services which you have purchased, for payment
processing or to protect our copyright, trademarks and other legal rights. To
the extent that we do share your Personal Data with a service provider, we
would only do so if that party has agreed to comply with our privacy standards
as described in this privacy policy and in accordance with applicable law. Our
contracts with third parties prohibit them from using any of your Personal Data
for any purpose other than that for which it was shared.
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We may from time to time need to disclose certain information, which may
include your Personal Data, to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law,
regulation, court order, subpoena, warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding
or in response to a law enforcement agency request. Also, we may use your
Personal Data to protect the rights, property or safety of Warrambui
Retreat and Conference Centre (www.warrambui.com.au), our customers or third
parties.
If there is a change of control in one of our businesses (whether by merger,
sale, transfer of assets or otherwise) customer information, which may include
your Personal Data, could be transferred to a purchaser under a confidentiality
agreement. We would only disclose your Personal Data in good faith and where
required by any of the above circumstances.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
This website may contain links to other websites. These links are meant for
your convenience only. Links to third party websites do not constitute
sponsorship or endorsement or approval of these websites. Please be aware that
we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We
encourage our users to be aware, when they leave our website, to read the
privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally
identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information
collected by this website.
CHANGE IN PRIVACY POLICY
As we plan to ensure our privacy policy remains current, this policy is subject
to change. We may modify this policy at any time, in our sole discretion and
all modifications will be effective immediately upon our posting of the
modifications on this website. Please return periodically to review our privacy
policy.
