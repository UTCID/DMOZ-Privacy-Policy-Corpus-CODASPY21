In memory of Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Yoshi)
Yoshi passed away on May 30, 2018. He was adopted from a Planned Pethood adoption event as a kitten by his owners and brought to his furever home in August 2005. He had the ability to befriend anyone, and it was his endless desire to lie on his owners and a persistent attitude that earned him the nickname "Cuddle Bully." He loved head rubs, lying in the sun, cat nip toys, and chewing on fake Christmas trees. He was fiercely loved by his owners, and tolerated by his cat sister, Lola. He will be missed. Rest well, dear friend.

Nalla Gust
Nalla Gust
Our family adopted Nalla from Planned Pethood in January, 2003. At the time of her adoption, Nalla was very thin and was in need of "better nutrition." When Planned Pethood rescued Nalla, she was pregnant with 7 puppies and was described as being "skin, bone, and puppies."
Nalla was the perfect addition to our family and quickly stole everyone's heart.
She loved taking walks, running around with her doggie friends in the backyard, and receiving endless belly rubs. She saw all three of her "siblings" move out of the house and then became an "aunt" to two very special young human friends.
Unfortunately, Nalla was diagnosed with cancer, and although she went through chemo treatment and was in remission for several months, she succumbed to the disease on March 17, 2014. We choose to remember the many good years with Nalla and hope that her puppies (who were adopted out by PPI) found homes where they are spoiled just as much as Nalla was! Until we see you again...

Cramer lost his battle against cancer on Tuesday August 19th. He moved on in
the loving arms of his mom and dad and his beloved Auntie Donna.
Cramer was a Planned Pethood boy who from the moment he climbed into
his dad's arms at the adoption event was a wonderful and joyful addition
to our lives. He was always happy and full of life, he loved every
person he met, and brought sunshine to his grandma in the care facility.
We will always love you my crazy little friend and our lives will have
an empty space in it until we meet again, We love you Val and Dennis and

In Memory of Tiger
In Memory of Tiger
I adopted Tiger from Planned Pethood in 2001.
I first met Tiger at an event.
He came to visit me, and I fell in love with him.
He was the best dog ever.
Everyone Tiger met fell in love with him.
He was loving and wonderful.
He was approximately 3 or 4 when I got him.
When I met my significant other, he too fell in love with Tiger, and eventually the two of us moved to Michigan.
In early fall his CHF became very bad, and one day, when Gary had to carry him in after he was outside, we knew it was time.
Tiger was suffering too much.
Our vet met us at his office, and came outside to put our baby boy to sleep so he wouldn't have to go inside, as the vet wasn't his favorite place to be.
His favorite place was at our cottage at the lake.
I just wanted to say thank you for connecting me with the most awesome dog a person could ask for.
He was loved and had a good life with us.
I miss him so much, but his memories will always be with us.

Love from Liz & Bill Gladieux
In Memory of Squirt
Squirt
It was love at first site when we met Tyler at an adoption event. Such
a happy little guy that had been found living in a closet with only an
occasional piece of sandwich thrown to him! He had a wonderful foster,
Kim Hillyer, that took him in and cared for him. Thanks, Kim!
When we took him home, we really didn't like the name, but didn't know
what to call him. Our 80-year-old neighbor took care of THAT when they
met and he said, "Who's that cute little squirt?" Tyler's ears perked up
and we knew we had found his name... Squirt.
The next 10 years were great. He was the love of the neighborhood, the
PHS band mascot in his bee costume, the cuddle bug that never tired of
licking your hands or face, the dog who once had no food found out there
was very little food he didn't like! Through allergies, asthma, and
interdigital cysts, he was a happy dog who loved his caregivers at South
Suburban Animal Hospital. Then the fateful night when we knew something
was wrong. While he never showed any discomfort, cancer had taken over
his abdomen and one of the tumors ruptured. He was septic and there was
no helping him.
True to his life, Squirt sat quietly licking my face as his "Dr. Jen"
administered his relief from pain. There has never been and never will
be another dog quite like Squirt. I miss you, little man... I always
will.
In Memory of Froggie
We miss you, buddy. Love, Ryan Vis and Jamie Anderson
In Memory of Froggie
We adopted Froggie shortly after we bought our first house. He was the
foster parent's favorite and the volunteers at the adoption event were
surprised that he was going home with us (they thought the foster
parents would keep him!). We're so thankful he did come home with us as
he quickly became the center of activity in the house.
Our sadness at his passing is tempered by the joy he brought to our
home. He was always ready for a walk, always ready to play, even when he
wasn't feeling his best. We miss you, buddy.

Bruttie, we will love you forever. You are the best dog we could have
ever hoped for and you will be in our hearts forever, as you our first
baby. You were so kind and smart, such a good boy. It was love at
first sight. Your sweet face and little fringes sealed the deal.
Thank you for being in our family.
Sweet boy, we will see you over the rainbow.
We love you to pieces,

Ryder came to us when we were a newly married couple just after moving
into our first house.
He very quickly became our child. He taught us so
much and gave us so much love and companionship. He was taken so
suddenly, but it never would have been enough time. He was so loved by
our families and has a very special place in our hearts.
Ryder,
You were the best dog we could ever ask for. We were so lucky and proud
to have you. Thank you for loving and caring for us. We miss you so much
and pray that you are running free and watching over us. We look forward
to seeing you again. You were a good boy and we love you!
Love always,

Buster, you licked your way into our hearts. We loved you more with each prance of joy and groan of contentment. The yard seems so much smaller and emptier without you racing around it. You were our big dog who thought he was a lap dog. But nothing seems small about the hole you've left in our lives and hearts. We love you and miss you, and always will.
Until we meet again,

Spence
I am so humbled by this donation in memory of Spence.
He is most certainly missed.
I actually had to keep this on the back burner for a few days while I got the fosters in their forever homes before I submitted Spence's picture because it still makes me cry when I think about him a lot.
He was loved by so many people as he shared his life with not only our family but also his "Mimi and Peeps" (my mom and dad) who he was very close to.
He's was such wonderful little ray of sunshine.
Mike is an angel, and I can't thank him enough for the kind gesture.
What an awesome thought :)

Chandler
Chandler
Chandler was the best and sweetest cat I have ever known. He was my companion since he was a tiny kitten, until he recently lost his graceful fight with several health problems at the age of twelve. He had the biggest heart of any animal I've ever known, and never, ever, stopped purring. He was loving, selfless, and had a soul whose warmth you could feel radiating. He loved popcorn and in his younger years would wait patiently by the microwave when he heard it popping. And if you didn't share your salty snacks with him, he would swipe some when you weren't looking! I hope Chandler is now free of suffering and is playing at the Rainbow Bridge, and I hope I get to see him again, for I so miss the hugs and kisses he so patiently let me shower upon him. He was always up for a cuddle and enjoyed a good belly rub. He has definitely taken a large piece of my heart with him. In return, he left me wonderful memories of our time together, and I'm so thankful he shared his life with me. Miss you more than words can say, little buddy. Until we meet again...

November 19, 2009 - June 16, 2011
>We adopted Max from Planned Pethood in January 2010. This June, we learned he had Osteosarcoma, an aggressive form of bone cancer. We were shocked, since he was only 1 1/2 years old. He was always so playful and had the funniest personality. He was just the cutest little guy and loved everyone. Even though he was only with us for a short time, we feel so fortunate to have had such a special dog in our lives. We will think of him and love him every day of our lives. He will live in our hearts forever.

"My Best Friend"
"My Best Friend"
I lost my dog a few years back. She was hands down my best friend. When I saw the pictures of Sequoia after her surgery, it reminded me of a surgery my girl had. She barely made it herself and she was never the same after. This donation is in memory of my best friend who has always been in my heart and will never be forgotten. It's mind boggling how much of an effect a 4 footed animal can have on a person. They are priceless. I wish I had more to donate...but I hope this helps. Thank you for all the work you do protecting and caring for the four footed angels of this earth.

October 3, 1995 - March 12, 2011
My Dear Sweet MacKenzie Marie,
When I moved to Toledo, alone, 15 years ago I was so lonely.
I missed my family and my friends terribly.
Someone suggested getting a kitten and I excitedly began my search for you.
I wanted a calico and you were the perfect little kitten.
Full of spunk, barely 7 weeks old, I brought you home and loved you like no other.
Full of fleas and worms, I cleaned you up and got you the veterinary care you needed to be healthy.
You were my best friend and companion for 15 years, adapting to different homes, family members and other furbabies as well.
You stood by and watched as I fostered mama cats with kittens and dogs, patiently waiting until I had time for you.
You watched me bring home a husband, two baby girls and numerous dogs and cats, always remaining loyal (ok, maybe not without complaint sometimes) and slept beside me every night.
I still can't believe you are gone, baby girl, and I miss you with all of my heart.
Please find your other fur-siblings at the bridge (Ferris and Cody) and wait for me...I'll see you someday.
You had stage presence, my girl.
There will never be another like you.
Ear Rubs and Head Butts!
Love you!
Mama

Katie
Katie
Katie,
You came to me afraid and unhappy; slowly, you blossomed into an awesome dog. You gave me unconditional love and asked for nothing in return. You loved to socialize and thought every day was a dog park day. Sadly, I could control your pain no longer and my last kindness left was to help you to the Rainbow Bridge. Run and play pain free. Thank you for sharing your life with me.

Chloe
Chloe
On Christmas Eve we lost the best gift we ever received. Chloe came into our lives by accident, but we promised to give her the happy life she had been denied. She brightened our lives every day and taught us to take joy in simply living--napping in the sun, a good tummy rub, and chasing the wind on a summer day. When the brain tumor began slowly taking away our beloved puppy piece by piece, we tried to fight it. We wanted to give her just one more day in the sun. Chloe was the bravest dog we ever knew. She kept trying to walk even when her legs didn't want to carry her. Eventually, though, we couldn't ask her to keep fighting. We'll miss her terribly and continue to love her until we see her again.
For seven years, she was my truest friend. She was the first creature I saw every morning and last one I saw at night. Having to say good-bye has been the hardest thing I've ever done.
Oh puppa, I ache inside, but I know you're at peace now. Keep watch over us, my love, and help me chase the bad dreams away.

Boscoe
Boscoe
We adopted Boscoe from you when he was 17 months old. We were a newly married couple living in Toledo, OH and he was truly our first "baby". He passed away this week at nearly 13 years of age. He traveled with us, was our faithful companion and whole-heartedly welcomed our son, Zachary, into the family 6 years ago. He died peacefully in his sleep from a tumor in his spleen. It was very unfortunate that we did not have any idea he had this tumor. He was active until the end of his life and never let on that he was in pain. We are deeply saddened and will miss him dearly. We thank you for the opportunity to adopt this great dog and for the wonderful work you continue to do. Please include our beautiful Boscoe (in this shot with our son Zachary) on your memorandum wall.
Sincerely,
Jani Lewis and Mark Mogavero

As I think of you, I hurt everywhere inside. You were my first, and don't tell the others, my favorite. Time passes and I grow to miss you more each day. You are my love and my baby. I can't wait to hold you again someday. To kiss your nose and to say, 'my lovely child, I've missed you so'. I love you with every part of my being.
You couldn't have been better to me and I thank you. Your dad and I love and miss you so.

To Chelsea With Love
Chels,
Just a baby, left to fend for yourself, you chose me to be your mom, and I fell in love with you. For 14 years, you were with me through joys and heartaches, but the biggest heartache of all was knowing that I couldn't save you in the end; that I had to let you go. You were the sweetest, softest cat I've ever known. You brought me such comfort. You will be in my heart always. Until I hold you in my arms again, sweetheart.
Your mom,

Charlie,
Sweet, sweet boy. I rescued you from the bitter cold of winter and you made your home in my heart. Our time together was so short, but I am so grateful that God blessed me with you, my angel. You were such a character! You brought so much joy to my life and broke my heart when you left. You will be in my heart always. Until I hold you in my arms again, punkin' boy.
Your mom,

Sully
Sully
To my brother, Sully,
I miss our howling sessions, burying my face in your thick fur, your paw on my lap when I was upset, your steady stare into my eyes until I smiled. I miss the order you kept over your canine pack here. They, too, seem lost. During walks in the woods as a pup, the deer scared and sent you running back to me. I never thought you'd be my protector, confidant, caregiver or train so many foster puppies. Someday I'll find the courage to let the wind unite your ashes and spirit. For now, I can still touch you.
Kathy Kozak
Heidi
Heidi
Sweet Heidi,
You were an "extra" on the transport the day you came to Planned Pethood. I was there to take home another puppy to foster, but everyone said I would love you and would take you home too. Well, they were right and you came home with me as well. I only had you for three short weeks before you were taken from me. You were an excellent puppy so I couldn't let you suffer anymore. I will miss you terribly, but I know you are no longer suffering. When you find Brandy at the Bridge, give her a kiss for me.
Until we meet again.
Love,
Your foster mom
Radar
Radar
You taught us so much in your short 8 years with us - that it's okay to be 40-something and play out in the snow like a kid with you; that running routine errands in the car is the best thing on earth; and that even though it's freezing outside, going for a walk is still fun. You never won any official titles or anything like that, but then you never tried to. To us you earned the title of "Our Boy" and you let us know everyday of your life just how much that meant to you. We love you and miss you and will see you again some day.
Love,
Mom and Dad
Bella
Bella
I am trying not to cry as I write this, but I miss my girl so much. Bella (which means beautiful in Italian) our Rott/Lab mix went over Rainbow Bridge on 4/6/2006. She was a very humorous yet stern girl when need be. She had to be wherever daddy was you see she absolutely adored him and the ground he walked on. I wasn't jealous of this cause I knew she loved me just as much, but in a different way. Bella was a save from the Weiler Holmes in East Toledo 9 years ago. I stopped my car after work one night to find some young boys hitting her with a golf club while she was tied to a grill. She was so ragged that we named her Bella out of sarcasm. Her favorite thing was to make sure that my husband and I never slept at night as she laid right between us every single night. I miss those nights...God love you Bella and I will see you again.

Casey
Casey
Casey came to live with his mom Bonnie, one month after her husband died. Casey was a wonderful companion, and could sense the mood of his mom, knowing when a warm nuzzle was needed. He was a gentle soul, and loved all people. He was especially tender with children.
The past six years Casey would come to Hospice with her mom where they volunteered. He would visit both patients and staff, always bringing a smile to those
he met. Throughout his life Casey provided support and love to those who needed it. He will be greatly missed.

Bear
Bear
We never met a dog like Bear. He was a big dog with a bigger heart. He was the most loving animal who never hurt anything even our guinea pig, Squeaker. Bear loved life. He loved to play with Fatty and Frisky his kitty friends, and Luke, Angus and Lucy, his girlfriend. Bear was a troubled doggy who had problems eating things that were bad for him. But as much trouble as he was, he was the most loved dog. He received the best of care at the Findlay Animal Care Center and Findlay Animal Hospital. But the Angels at Ohio State Veterinary Hospital saved his life time after time. Dr. Cooper was not only his surgeon, but a devoted friend. Thank you for all you did for him. We will miss you Bear and we will see you in the time where we will play together once again. Thank you for all your companionship and devotion. Everyone who met you was touched by you and those who knew you loved you. There will never be another Beardoggy. You were one of a kind. Rest in peace, dear friend.

Duncan
Duncan
Duncan was a Humane Society kitty who shared his life with us for more than 16 years. He picked us one day when we made a trip to donate newspapers and towels. His cage was at eye level and he reached out to play with my hair. We had no intention of bringing home a third kitten but he didn't give us any choice. He quickly made a place for himself in our home by teaching us about his need to snuggle and love on his people. Duncan lived to be hugged and scratched. He loved his kibbles almost as much as his people. He quickly became known as the sweetest cat who ever lived in our household. When his kidneys could no longer sustain him, it was a very sad goodbye for us. Our wonderful vet, Michael Darga, helped us realize that a tough decision for us was a compassionate one for a remarkable cat who shared so much love with us.

Our Warty wandered into our yard 14 years ago and lived a happy life as the "man of the house" until he told us it was time for him to cross over that bridge.
We'll miss you Wart.

In Memory Of Maxx
In the fall of 2003 I stopped at the Andersons General Store, in Maumee, to pick up some items for our garden. I never realized what an adventure we were about to begin! Andersons was hosting a Planned Pethood adoption event on that sunny autumn day, and I stopped to say "hi" to some of the wonderful dogs that were there.
A young lady, by the name of Nancy, was there with a sweet, adorable little collie mix, named "Bingo". Nancy and I talked for a bit, and we agreed that the dog's name did not match his personality at all, and she admitted that she had been calling him "Max" while he was under her foster care. As we were talking, this little guy crawled right up into my lap, and proceeded to charm me beyond measure! By the time I left the Anderson's that day, Max was under my care, and he very quickly became the most wonderful addition to our family. He was very good to us, enjoyed many happy walks at the park and rides in the car and was a trooper beyond measure, right up to the end!
Our whole extended family is mourning Maxx's loss right now, and are missing his sweet, gentle presence in our lives. He was such an integral part of our group! We would like to express our appreciation to Planned Pethood for the wonderful work that they do...our lives have all been so much richer, as a result!

Simon
You were one of the best dogs I've ever met. I cried when I first saw you, because it broke my heart that a dog could ever be in such bad shape. You were so kind and loving from the start and simply trusted that we would care of you now. I was so proud of how much progress you made, and that everyone who heard your story or met you fell in love with you, too. I loved rubbing your head and how you stayed right by my side most of the time. I'm very sorry you didn't have a long happy life with a new family, but I am honored that you will be waiting for me at the Rainbow Bridge.
We love you, Simon.

We'll miss you, sweet Simon. You were in our lives for such a short time but made our lives so much better while you were here. You will be loved in our hearts forever.
