Polish Fest - June 11-13, 2021
*all 2020 tickets will be honored in 2021
After much consideration, the Board of Directors of the Polish Heritage Alliance has made the difficult decision to cancel Polish Fest for 2020.
It was our hope to reschedule to a later date, unfortunately, this is not feasible.With the current COVID-19 situation in the U.S., the health and safety of our attendees, entertainers, vendors and volunteers is our greatest concern.
We look forward to bringing Polish Fest back to celebrate our 40th festival scheduled for June 11-13 2021
