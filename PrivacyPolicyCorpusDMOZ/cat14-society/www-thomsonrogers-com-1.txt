Consultation RequestPrivacy PolicyThomson Rogers recognizes the importance of your personal privacy and the sensitivity of your personal information. As lawyers we have a professional obligation to keep confidential all information we receive within a lawyer-client relationship. We are committed to protecting any personal information we hold. This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information and safeguard your privacy.Your Privacy RightsBeginning on January 1, 2004, all businesses engaged in commercial activities must comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, (“the Act”) and the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, which it incorporates. These obligations extend to lawyers and law firms, including Thomson Rogers. The Act gives you rights concerning the privacy of your personal information. The Act makes Thomson Rogers responsible for the personal information we collect and hold. To ensure this accountability, we have developed this policy, and trained our lawyers and support staff about our policies and practices. Why Does Thomson Rogers Need Personal Information?Thomson Rogers provides legal services to a wide range of clients. In doing so, it requires personal information in order to fulfill the terms of its retainers and to fulfill its professional responsibilities. As well, it occasionally produces and distributes materials concerning its services and new developments in the law. What Personal Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?Thomson Rogers collects personal information relevant to our retainers with our clients. According to the Act, Personal information is defined as follows:“personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.The information we collect may go beyond contact information and include financial or medical information (as an example) depending on the nature of the matter under investigation.If we did not collect and use personal information we would not be able to provide legal services. In order to provide meaningful advice to our clients, we collect information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. Wherever possible we collect your personal information directly from you.Sometimes we may obtain information about you from other sources, for example:Your insurance companyYour real estate agent in a property transaction;From a government agency or registry;Your employer;an accountant or other professional, like a doctor;the other side in a litigation matter. ConsentIn most cases, we ask you to consent, if we collect, use, or disclose your personal information. Sometimes, your consent may be implied through your contact with us and the mere fact that we are retained to deal with a matter on your behalf. Thomson Rogers’ standard retainer confirms our client’s consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the course of our retainer. Use of Your InformationWe use your personal information to provide legal advice and services, to fulfill our own professional responsibilities, to administer our client (time and billing databases) to manage our conflict avoidance program and, occasionally, to include you in our marketing activities. If you tell us that you no longer wish to receive marketing information about our services, or about new developments in the law, we will not send any further material to you.Thomson Rogers does not disclose personal information to any third party to enable them to market their products and services. For example, we do not provide our client mailing lists to others.Thomson Rogers will retain personal information as long as may be necessary to complete our retainer, fulfill our own professional responsibilities, conduct our business, satisfy the requirements of the Law Society of Ontario and our insurers and as may be required for the maintenance of our marketing activities and our conflicts system. Disclosure of Your Personal InformationUnder certain circumstances, and/or as part of our retainer, Thomson Rogers will disclose personal information, including:When we are required or authorized by law to do soWhen you have consented to the disclosure, expressly or by implication or its disclosure is necessary in the litigation or other matter about which we have been retained.When our retainer requires us to give your information to third parties (for example to a doctor for the purpose of obtaining a medical opinion or the opposing parties) your consent will be implied, unless you tell us otherwise. However, in litigation, you may have to disclose information and the failure to do so could adversely affect any claim you have.Where it is necessary to establish or collect feesIf we engage a third party to provide administrative services to us (like computer back-up services or archival file storage, or our auditors) and the third party is bound by our privacy policy.If we engage expert witnesses on your behalfIf we retain other law firms on your behalfIf the information is already publicly known. Updating Your InformationSince we use personal information to provide legal services, it is important that the information be accurate and up-to-date.
