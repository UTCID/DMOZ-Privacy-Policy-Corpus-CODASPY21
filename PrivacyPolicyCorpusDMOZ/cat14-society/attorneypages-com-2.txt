This Privacy Policy shall also apply to any other website (or portion of a website) that is owned and/or operated by AdviceCo that links to this Privacy Policy. We respect the privacy rights of our users and recognize the importance of protecting information collected about you.Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you will understand how we collect, use, and maintain your personal information, and what your choices are when it comes to using, accessing, and correcting that information.We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will revise the Last Updated date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you access our Sites to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.The Services may contain links to other websites or applications for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites or applications.This Privacy Policy covers:What information do we gather about you?What do we do with the information we collect about you?With whom do we share the information that we gather?What is our email policy?How do I change or update my personal information?How do I opt-out from receiving emails?Is my information protected?Account Information and RetentionCompliance with Legal ProcessChildren’s GuidelinesYour California Privacy RightsChanges to This Privacy PolicyWHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?The information gathered when you interact with the Services falls into two categories:1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our Sites, enter a contest, or provide your email address, and2) Non-personal information that is collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.Personal Information That You Give Us or Ask a Third Party to Share with UsRegistration InformationRegistration for one or more of the Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic and/or professional information (such as ZIP code, age, sex, title, industry or licensure, etc.) to register.In some instances, you may register or enhance your profile by linking certain of your external accounts (such as your Facebook, LinkedIn or Google accounts) to one or more of our Services. By doing that, you are asking those external accounts to send us certain information from those social media and other accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can unlink your social media accounts or control what they share from their privacy controls.Social media registration features may collect your IP address, the page(s) you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on one of our Sites.You can disassociate your AdviceCo registration from third-party accounts any time. For more detail, please email us at admin@adviceco.com.Billing and Credit Card InformationTo enable payment and donations for certain Services, we may collect and store your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will generally only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments and Reviews)We may offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on AdviceCo Sites and Services. “Public Activities” are any actions you take on one or more of our Sites and/or Services that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your Public Activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by AdviceCo or its designees for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in Public Activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in the course of your Public Activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your Public Activities or Submissions. For more information, please read the Forums, Discussions and User Generated Content section of the Terms of Service.Public Activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your Public Activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. We are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your Public Activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not by us or our agents.When you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.Contests, Sweepstakes and Special OffersWe collect personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party, we normally will reflect that at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you should not participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.Surveys, Polls, Panels and Market ResearchWe may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys or polls. Data may be collected through our own or a third party's Services, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.Members of our Panels agree to participate in surveys, polls or discussions about their use of our Services.Conferences and Live EventsWe may receive information about participants and attendees at live events from sign-in and registration lists. We may share this information with event or function sponsors or participants.Non-Personal Information Collected Using TechnologyInformation Collected by Us Using TechnologyWe use various Internet technologies to manage and track use of the Sites and Services. Non-personal information that we collect using these technologies may be combined with other information about you.Device Information. We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Sites and Services, such as IP address, geographic location information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.Cookies and Other Similar Technologies. We use “cookies” and other similar technologies. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. These technologies allow us to manage access to and use of the Sites and Services, recognize you and provide personalization, and help us understand how people use our Sites and Services so that we can provide better site experiences and tools in the future. Some website features or services may not function properly if your computer does not accept cookies or uses ad blocking software.Do Not Track. Some browsers offer a "do not track" ("DNT") option. Because no common industry or legal standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.We may transmit non-personally identifiable website usage information to third parties in order to show you advertising for an AdviceCo or affiliate's website when you visit other sites or use Applications.Analytics, Log Files, and Reading HistoryAs is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the Internet), system activity, browser type, browser language, operating system, hardware settings, the date and time of your visit, the referral URL, and other usage information about the use of the Sites and Services, including a history of the pages you view.We may combine this automatically-collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer to you, including customized recommendations, advertising and currency display, to improve marketing, and to track access and use of the Sites and Services across the devices that you use.We may retain third parties to provide us information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of our users. They may independently record the type of device and operating system you are using, general location information, as well as events that occur within our apps, such as how often you use our apps.Location Information. Some of our mobile applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we may store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit that information to us, and we will not collect or store location information.The ads in our apps may be targeted to you based on your current GPS location, your ZIP code and/or device’s IP address.Third PartiesSome of the services and advertisements included on the Sites and Services and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of the Sites and Services.These companies may place or recognize cookies, web beacons or other technology to track certain non-personal information about our website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the Sites or Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device's unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.We normally do not have access to, nor control over, third-party use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.We use Google, Bing, and other services to serve advertisements on some of our Sites and Services, and may use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to our Sites, Services, and other sites on the Internet.
