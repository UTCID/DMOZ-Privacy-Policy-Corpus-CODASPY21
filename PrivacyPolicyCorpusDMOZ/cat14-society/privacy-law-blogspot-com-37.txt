Judge Excludes Tannin E-Mail
The U.S. District Court Judge presiding over the
Bear Stearns Asset Management fraud case (U.S. v. Cioffi) has excluded from evidence an e-mail written by Matthew Tannin using his personal account because "the warrant did not, on its face, limit the items to be seized from Tannin’s personal email account to emails containing evidence of the crimes charged in the indictment, or, indeed, any crime at all. It was, therefore, unconstitutionally broad under George."
(United States v. George, 975 F.2d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 1992).
