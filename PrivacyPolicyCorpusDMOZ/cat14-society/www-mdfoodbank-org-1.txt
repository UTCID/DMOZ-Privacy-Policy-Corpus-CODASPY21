If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, then you do not have permission to access, use, or submit information to the Site.
The Food Bank respects your privacy. We created this Privacy Policy to explain why we collect certain information and how we will protect your personal privacy within the Site. The information we collect from you may include information, such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, or any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline (collectively, Personal Information) as well as other information that does not identify you as an individual person.

What information we collect
Information you voluntarily provide
We collect information, including Personal Information, from you when you voluntarily provide such information. For example, if you register as a partner or volunteer with the Food Bank, provide a donation to the Food Bank, or submit an inquiry to the Site, we may collect your name, contact information, and location.
Sensitive information
We ask that you not send or otherwise disclose sensitive information to us about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background, or trade union membership, unless we specifically request such sensitive information. If you provide sensitive information to us without our request, then we may delete any such sensitive information.
Children
The Site is not intended for individuals under the age of 13, and the Food Bank does not knowingly collect information from such individuals. We may delete any information identified as being provided by individuals under the age of 13.
Server logs
The servers we use to host the Site collect certain log information about your use of the Site. This log information consists of the typical information collected when a server hosts a website over the Internet, such as the internet protocol (IP) address assigned to your device, the date and time the Site was requested, and the previous webpage you visited. Depending on the configuration of your connection to the Internet, your IP address may provide an indication of your location, which is generally no more precise than the city where your device is located.
Internet browser and device services
The internet browser you use to access the Site collects and provides us certain information about your device. Depending on your browser, this information can include the type of device you use, your operating system type and version, and browser type and version. Services running on your device may provide us information about you. For example, geolocation services running on your device may provide address-level location data to us.
Cookies
Like most websites, we use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies (collectively, Cookies) to track your usage of the Site. Cookies are small files that can be issued to your device when you visit a website or use a mobile application, or that can be embedded in the content of an email, webpage, or application. Depending on their purpose, some Cookies may expire when you close your internet browser or your mobile application, and other Cookies may remain stored on your device for a longer period of time. We use Cookies to track your access to the Site, your usage of different features of the Site, your usage of other websites or mobile applications, and to track whether you click links or access certain content that we provide to you on the Site or in communications to you.
We may directly set Cookies to your device or a third party may set cookies to your device through the Site. For example, we may contract with third party service providers, to process your data and analyze usage patterns on the Site. We currently work with the following third party service providers:

Limiting Collection
Most internet browsers, mobile applications, and operating systems allow you to configure privacy settings to limit or disable cookies, web beacons, and related technologies. For example, you can typically adjust settings to cause a browser to notify you when a cookie has been issued or to block cookies altogether. You can also generally disable services running on your device, such as geolocation services. Certain internet browsers may enable you to request that websites “do not track” your browsing behavior on the website. The Site currently does not respond to such “do not track” signals because there is no consistent industry standard for compliance with such signals. For more information privacy settings and configuring cookies, web beacons, and related technologies please see aboutads.info/choices.
Although you are under no obligation to provide us with information, certain information we collect is necessary for the functionality of the Site. Should you choose to withhold certain information, we may not be able to provide you with access to or use of some features of the Site.
