Lending Library
Libib Help
Updated: March 17, 2020
COVID-19 Update: WSBA Lending Library is Currently Closed
Due to public health considerations in light of COVID-19, the WSBA Lending Library is currently closed until further notice.
With uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, we are unable to confirm a reopening date for the WSBA Lending Library at this time.
As a result, the WSBA has decided it is in the best interest of our members and staff to stop accepting holds as of Nov. 15 on Lending Library materials until further notice.
If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an email.
Questions about the WSBA lending library? Check out our FAQsDon't see what you're looking for? Send us an email.
Frequently Asked Questions
Getting Started
Managing Your Account
Holds
Borrowed Books
Getting StartedHow do I start using the lending library?The WSBA Lending Library is available to all licensed WSBA members.To get started, you'll need to create a library patron profile for Libib, the website we use to manage the library:Log in to myWSBA and complete the sign-up page:From there, you can immediately start using the library by visiting Libib:Once you're ready to place a hold, set a password for your account:I'm getting an error message that I'm ineligible to access the library.After you log in to myWSBA, if you receive an error message that says "Our records indicate that you are not eligible to use the Lending Library," but you are a licensed WSBA member, it may be that you are using the wrong login credentials.Try logging in to myWSBA with your WSBA license/bar number, as opposed to an email address.  That should solve the problem.  If you are still receiving that error message as a licensed WSBA member, please email us so we can help.

HoldsWhat happens after I place a hold?If the book is in stock (not on hold or checked out to anyone else), we will automatically ship it to you within two business days, using the address you provided for your Libib account.If the book is checked out to someone else, it should become available within four to six weeks and we will ship it to you once it is returned.We ship titles on a rolling basis, so if you have multiple holds you may not receive them all at once if they are not all in stock at the same time.I received a notification from Libib that a title is "available." What does that mean?This is an automated message from our vendor that unfortunately we are not able to turn off. Please disregard this message as it is sent automatically from our software system and does not take hold priorities into account. You do not need to take any further action to receive your hold requests. We will ship titles to you automatically.I placed a hold on multiple titles, but only received some. When will I receive the other books?All titles are shipped to you automatically. If you place a hold and do not receive a title, that means that it is with another patron or is on hold by someone else who is earlier in the queue. Once we have a book and you are first in the queue, we will ship that title to you as well.Can I stop by in person?You can stop by and borrow books in person at the WSBA offices, but at this point, we are not able to give you the option of placing a hold online and picking up the title in person.To visit the library, check in with the reception desk on our main floor:Washington State Bar Association1325 Fourth Ave., Suite 600Seattle, WA 98101-2539You can stop by anytime between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday-Friday.
