Introduction to Hay House’s Privacy Policy
Hay House has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
Since 1987, Hay House has been the leader in helping people improve the quality of their lives and we strive to deliver you the best possible experience through multiple channels. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information is a priority at Hay House, and we believe that a single, comprehensive privacy policy that is straightforward and clear is in the best interests of our customers and our businesses.

We will also outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
