Hicksons’ team of lawyers provides advice and representation in professional conduct and related disciplinary matters.
This includes:
advising regulatory authorities on proposed disciplinary proceedings, including provision of natural justice, privacy and prospects of success;
drafting pleadings and supporting affidavits for commencement of disciplinary proceedings;
interviewing witnesses and drafting affidavits or statements in support of disciplinary proceedings;
representing regulatory authorities in disciplinary proceedings and appeals, including appearing before courts and tribunals and briefing barristers as appropriate; and
enforcing orders made in disciplinary proceedings including pursuing recoveries under costs orders.
We also advise and represent respondents to disciplinary proceedings in circumstances where the prosecuting regulatory authority is not a client of Hicksons, including disciplinary proceedings against solicitors, accountants, insolvency practitioners and medical practitioners.
