Submit a Case Review
We will review your case for free, with no obligation. We will give you solid, practical advice regarding your case, as well as the next steps to take. You do not have to pay a retainer fee up front. We only charge a fee if we’re successful and recover a financial award on your behalf. Our fees are based on a percentage of that award. This is known as a contingent fee agreement.
The Janssen Law Center accepts most personal injury cases on a contingent fee basis. The contingent fee is perhaps the one device in law that gives injured people – no matter their financial means – an even break against giant corporations and insurances companies in a court of law.
