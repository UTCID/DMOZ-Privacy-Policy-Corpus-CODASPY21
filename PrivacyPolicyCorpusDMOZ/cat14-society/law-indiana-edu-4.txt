HomeAcademicsJD degreeLegal writingDifferent Kind of ProgramDifferent Kind of ProgramA different kind of programAll law schools offer writing courses. Our program is different in four key ways:A long-standing priority. Well before most law schools retained seasoned professionals to teach writing—relying instead on a revolving door of recent grads, adjunct instructors, and even 3L students—Indiana Law’s 1Ls had the benefit of full-time legal-writing professors with significant experience in both teaching and practicing law. Our current LRW faculty collectively possess decades of teaching experience and over 25 years of practice experience as trial and appellate litigators, business lawyers, and judicial clerks.  A commitment to both peer and expert mentoring. Legal writing, even for students with a strong background in other kinds of writing, requires significant adjustment. To help with the adjustment, each professor recruits two dean’s writing fellows. These are successful 2Ls or 3Ls whose experience is close to the 1Ls’ and who are accessible for all manner of help and guidance, both with writing and with other study skills and even job-search strategies. And because beginning legal writers also benefit from the insights of the most experienced legal writers, each year the LRW program invites a distinguished judge to address the 1Ls on the topic of legal writing.A consistent, state-of-the-art foundation. No matter which section of LRW you land in, you’ll have a similar, high-quality experience. Our LRW faculty collaborate closely—with each other, with the dean's writing fellows, and with the school’s highly skilled law librarians—to create a carefully curated progression of assignments. Using both online and traditional methods, the LRW course covers statutory and case-law research and analysis, predictive writing, trial-level advocacy, legal citation, professionalism, and writing mechanics. This foundation of core skills positions all students perfectly for the next step, whether it’s opinion writing in a judicial field placement, appellate advocacy in moot court, source-checking on law journal, academic writing in a research seminar, legal drafting in an experiential course, or on-the-job writing for a legal employer.                        Strong follow-through.  Students at Indiana Law must take at least two more writing classes beyond the first year (not just one, as at many schools), and Indiana Law offers a wide range of upper-level courses that will help you hone your writing skills. In seminar courses, students focus on academic writing in cutting-edge areas of law. In other advanced writing courses, students focus on particular legal documents or on particular areas of practice.Listed below are the upper-level research and writing courses offered at Indiana Law.Seminar coursesL782 Seminar in Administrative Law: Lawyering in the Modern Administrative StateL778 Seminar in American Legal History: The Legal Foundations of American CapitalismL766 Seminar in Children and the Law: Reproduction and ChildhoodL766 Seminar in Children and the LawL703 Seminar in Commercial Law: Consumer CreditL770 Seminar in Comparative InequalityL770 Seminar in Comparative Law: Islamic LawL736 Seminar in Congress, the Presidency and the CourtsL799 Seminar in Constitutional Law: The Courts, the Democratic Process,and the PeopleL684 Seminar in Constitutional Design: Rights, Gender, and States of EmergencyL799 Seminar in Constitutional LawL799 Seminar in Constitutional Law: First AmendmentL799 Seminar in Constitutional Law: Sexuality, Reproduction, and the ConstitutionL690 Seminar in Corporate Law: Financial RegulationL776 Seminar in Criminal Law: Current Issues in Law and ProcedureL776 Seminar in Criminal Law: Federal SentencingL566 Seminar in Electronic Mass MediaL763 Seminar in Environmental Law: Institutional Analysis of Social-Ecological SystemsL728 Seminar in GlobalizationL664 Seminar in Information PrivacyL712 Seminar in International Law: Drone LawL730 Seminar in Intellectual PropertyL712 Seminar in International Law: Legal Dimensions of the Fight against the Islamic StateL637 Seminar in Introduction to Biotechnological InnovationL797 Seminar in JurisprudenceL750 Seminar in Law and DevelopmentL713 Seminar in Law and EconomicsL748 Seminar in Law and Psychology of Crime, Culpability, and PunishmentL724 Seminar in Law and Society of ChinaL710 Seminar in Law and Society: Work, Family, and the LawL773 Seminar in Tax PolicyL636 Seminar in Transnational LawL639 Seminar in the Supreme Court as an InstitutionL714 Seminar on Judicial ConductOther advanced writing coursesB791 Advanced Legal WritingB659 American Legal HistoryB671 Appellate Practice and Procedure: Criminal Appeal: From Transcript to ArgumentB580 Civil Rights StatutesB575 Constitutional Design in Multiethnic SocietiesB760 Constitutional History ColloquiumB668 Constitutional Law IIB714 Deliberative LeadershipB568 Gender and The LawB663 Labor Law IB658 Law and Education: Higher EducationB761 Law and PhilanthropyB592 Law and Political Theory: Institutional Analysis & DevelopmentB554 LegislationB603 Remedies and EquityB519 State Constitutional LawB588 Strategies in Critical Reading and Writing: Family LawB526 Tax Policy ColloquiumB709 Transactional DraftingB709 Transactional Drafting: Anatomy of a DealB709 Transactional Drafting: Tax
