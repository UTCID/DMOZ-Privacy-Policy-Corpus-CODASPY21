Residents’ RightsResidents of assisted living and nursing homes have important rights that are guaranteed by law. If you or your loved one is not receiving appropriate care, contact your local Ombudsmen at Missoula Aging Services for help. Your Ombudsman can assist with issues related to health, safety and rights.
The Long-term Care Ombudsman program ensures residents’ voices are heard so they can continue to lead a good quality of life. For more information, call MAS at (406) 728-7682 to speak with your local ombudsman advocate.
