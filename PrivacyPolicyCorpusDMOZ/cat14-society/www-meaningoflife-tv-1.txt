Cookies
Cookies are bits of computer code stored on your own computer by a website that you visit. Cookies are often used to track a website’s usage patterns, traffic trends and user behavior. Many content adjustments and service improvements are made based on the data derived from cookies. Cookies are also sometimes used to save a user’s information so it doesn’t need to be re-entered each time the user visits.
The cookies we use on MeaningofLife.tv do not collect personally identifiable information. Currently we use cookies to limit the frequency with which a user is presented with pre-roll video ads. You may set your browser to refuse cookies from any website you visit. If you choose to do so, you should still have full use of MeaningofLife.tv, but you may see more frequent pre-roll video ads.
We also use the following Google services on MeaningofLife.tv, all of which employ cookies to collect nonpersonal information:

You may opt out of Google Analytics by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Google AdSense
AdSense is an advertising service provided by Google. We use this service to display ads on MeaningofLife.tv, which entails using the DoubleClick cookie to track user behavior concerning ads. The DoubleClick cookie enables Google and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to MeaningofLife.tv and/or other sites on the internet.
