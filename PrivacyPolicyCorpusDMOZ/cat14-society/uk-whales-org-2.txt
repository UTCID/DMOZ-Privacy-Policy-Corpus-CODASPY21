As with many websites, WDC uses cookies in order to provide you with a more personalised web service. A cookie is a text-only string of information that we pass to your computer's hard disk through your web browser so that our website can remember who you are. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.
This Policy sets out what cookies are, why we use cookies on our websites and your options relating to their use.
Who are ‘we’?
We are WDC, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a registered charity and company wholly owned and operated by WDC. A company registered in England and Wales with company number 2737421 and a charity registered in England and Wales with charity number 1014705, and Scotland with charity number SC040231. Our registered address is Brookfield House, 38 St Paul Street, Chippenham, Wiltshire SN15 1LJ.
WDC (Trading) Limited sells a range of goods through its shop and café based in Scotland, enters into corporate partnership agreements, and runs a raffle.  All of its profits are passed to WDC.  WDC (Trading) is wholly owned and controlled by WDC and all staff are employed by WDC.
When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. When services are delivered on the internet, it sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, such as your computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as ‘cookies’. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
What are ‘cookies’?
In simple terms a cookie is a small piece of information sent from our website to your computer to help us recognise it quickly. If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can navigate the websites like a normal user. Any information gathered through the use of cookies is compiled on an aggregate, anonymous basis.
Why do we use cookies on our websites?
We use cookies so that we can give you a better experience when you return to our websites. In particular we use cookies to:
avoid lengthy registration/personalisation of the site each time you visit and personalise it to suit your requirements
recognise you when you login and make it easier for you to access your account information
estimate our audience size and patterns
ensure that you are not asked to register twice
control how often visitors see similar adverts
track preferences and to improve and update our websites
track the progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests
Our websites may feature embedded ‘share’ buttons to enable users to easily share articles with their friends through a number of popular social networks. These sites may set a cookie when you are also logged in to their service. We do not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.
Use of cookies
We use two main types of cookies on our website, session and persistent cookies. Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.
Session or transient cookies
These cookies allow our websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around the site. These cookies expire after a browser session ends so are not stored longer term.
Persistent, permanent or stored cookies
These cookies are stored on a user's device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering a user's preferences and choices when using our site.
First- and third-party cookies
Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are, simply, cookies set by a website visited by the user - the website displayed in the URL window. Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user.  While there is no advertising on the WDC site you will find links to other sites for the purposes of processing payments, entering events or finding additional information.  Each of these sites will have its own policy and is responsible for notifying you of its cookie usage policy.
Specific cookies you may find on our website
You can find out up-to-date information which cookies are being used below.
Do I have to agree to cookies?
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you should be able to change your browser settings to prevent that or by changing the settings in the cookie preferences on this website at anytime. You should read the information that came with your browser software to see how you can set up your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This should then give you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web.
Where can I get more information about cookies and how to change my settings?
