Legal Project Management
For more than 20 years, Hicksons’ coronial law team has guided a large number of complex and high-profile coronial cases, acting for a variety of clients, including government departments, medical defence organisations, insurers, health practitioners, public and private hospitals, professional colleges, community health providers, ambulance services and medical associations.
Our work encompasses:
strategic planning to minimise impacts of negative findings by the coroner;
managing risks for future litigation arising from evidence cited at inquests; and
preparation of submissions to the coroner on evidence to assist with findings and recommendations.
Inquiries and inquests often involve legal, political and public relations implications, so we work closely with our clients to identify and achieve their objectives in these critical areas.
Our experienced lawyers inform clients at the earliest stage on the likely outcome and potential consequences flowing from a coronial investigation, enabling our clients to make informed decisions about important issues such as claims for privilege of documents and self-incrimination.
By collaborating with clients we mitigate risks and provide certainty, listening and giving clear, timely advice and always acting with integrity and sensitivity.
With significant collective experience and familiarity with the legislation that empowers the coroner, the team can:
advise on obligations under the Coroners Act to report deaths, to attend and give evidence at inquests;
investigate the circumstances surrounding a death;
anticipate the potential evidence the coroner requires for the Inquest;
contribute at an early stage to the coronial process by identifying key witness’s statements;
form collaborative working relationships with counsels assisting at coronial inquests;
assist with reputation management; and
provide strategic management of any related litigation.
