Help Tubman provide warmth for the people we serve this winter!
Many people fleeing violence and trauma often leave home quickly with little or nothing except what they have on them. At Tubman, we work to provide normalcy and basic needs for our clients so they can focus on their safety, stability and healing.
A warm coat is a necessity during a Minnesota winter, especially for many of our families as they rely on walking or public transportation.
In order to provide warmth this winter, we need your help and that of our generous community to collect 220 new coats.
We are looking for NEW coats for all genders, ages and sizes.
Specific sizes and needs include:
Infant – 3T/4T
Boys and Girls sizes M/L/XL
Adult sizes – Special emphasis on L-3X, as well as, coats appropriate for teens/young people
Weather-proof winter accessories - hats, gloves and scarfs. Please no handmade hats or knit gloves requested.
Our Great Tubman Coat Corral starts now and will run through the end of November. Will you, your family, friends or colleagues join us in making sure that families and individuals, who are experiencing violence, trauma and hardship from COVID-19, feel warmth, safety, hope and healing this upcoming winter?
