Help with Pursuing Purpose
Even when life seems meaningless, God has a purpose and a plan for your life. You might feel like God isn’t there, or you’ve lost your connection with Him. Keep reaching out for Him. You will find Him when you seek Him with your whole heart.
Take our Spiritual Meaning Assessment to see if you would benefit from meeting with a counselor.
