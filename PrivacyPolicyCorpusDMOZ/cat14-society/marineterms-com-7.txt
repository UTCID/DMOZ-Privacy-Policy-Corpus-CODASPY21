Absolute humidity
In a system of moist air, the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total volume of the system. Usually expressed as grams per cubic meter (g/m3).
Absolute instrument
An instrument whose calibration can be determined by means of simple physical measurements on the instrument. Compare to secondary instrument.
Absolute temperature
Temperature based on an absolute scale.
Absolute temperature scale
A temperature scale based on absolute zero. Same as Kelvin temperature scale.
Absolute zero
A hypothetical temperature characterized by a complete absence of heat and defined as 0 K, -273.15 C, or -459.67 F.
Absorption
The process in which incident radiation is retained by a substance. A further process always results from absorption.
Absorption hygrometer
