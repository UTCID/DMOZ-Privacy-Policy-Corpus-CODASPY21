It is Castle McCulloch’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.Website VisitorsLike most website operators, Castle McCulloch collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Castle McCulloch’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Castle McCulloch’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Castle McCulloch may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.Castle McCulloch also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs.
