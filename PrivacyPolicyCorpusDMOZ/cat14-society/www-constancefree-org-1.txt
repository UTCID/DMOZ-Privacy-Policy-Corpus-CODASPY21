Constance Free Church employs various media in its ministry practices. This includes video, digital and print media, social networks, and tv advertisements. We believe this is essential for our ministries as we strive to make our vision a reality. Our practices may include the use of names, photographs, and video of individuals and groups who attend gatherings on our campus. These stories of faith in action some of the most important tools God uses to encourage faith in others. Unless requested by ministry participants, we do not seek approval of the use of names and images. If you do not wish for your name or image to be used in a future Constance publication, or if you would like to reserve the right to review their use, please contact the appropriate staff member with oversight of the ministry in which you participate.
