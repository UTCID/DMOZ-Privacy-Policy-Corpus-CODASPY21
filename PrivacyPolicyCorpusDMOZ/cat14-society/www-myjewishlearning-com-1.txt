This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what information the MY JEWISH LEARNING (“MY JEWISH LEARNING” or “we” “our” or “us”) collects on our Websites (the “Websites”), how we use your information, and your choices. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices and sets out your obligations and ours with respect to your use of the Websites. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected on our Websites, and does not cover any information collected by any other websites or offline by MY JEWISH LEARNING (unless specifically stated) or any other company. By visiting the Websites, you agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
This Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time in order to address new issues and to reflect changes on the Websites or in the law. We reserve the right to revise or make any changes to this Privacy Policy, and your continual use of the Websites subsequent to any changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept such changes. You can tell that this Privacy Policy has been updated by checking the last revised date posted on the top of this page. If due to such changes, you decide that you want to remove any portion of your personal information from our database, please contact us at webmaster@myjewishlearning.com. If the policy is revised substantially, affected registrants or subscribers may receive an e-mail outlining the change.

Information MY JEWISH LEARNING Collects
In order to access certain portions of the Websites, or if you choose to participate in certain features, such as registering to become a member of MY JEWISH LEARNING, receiving one of our newsletters, ordering publications or making a donation, you may need to register and provide certain personally identifiable information (“PII”) about yourself, such as but not limited to your name, address, e-mail address, phone number or credit card information. In addition, we may on occasion provide you the opportunity to provide PII, such as name or e-mail address, of someone else, such as if you choose to e-mail a friend an article or make a donation in the name of someone else.
To enable donations via the MY JEWISH LEARNING Websites, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
In addition, when you visit our Websites, our web servers automatically collect certain non-PII, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our web pages and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Websites, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine the technology available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page.
For people who choose to become registered members of MY JEWISH LEARNING, upon completion of the registration process, we will send you a validation e-mail message.
For subscribers to MY JEWISH LEARNING’s free e-newsletters, MY JEWISH LEARNING uses a double opt-in process. After you provide your name and e-mail address via our Websites, you will also need to reply to a validation e-mail to fully activate your subscription.
By signing up for a MY JEWISH LEARNING e-newsletter, you agree to receive E-mail Offers sent to you by MY JEWISH LEARNING on behalf of sponsors of MY JEWISH LEARNING. MY JEWISH LEARNING will provide clear ways to stop receiving these e-mails in each e-mail offer it sends. At no time will any PII you have provided MY JEWISH LEARNING be disclosed to any third party for the purposes of transmitting E-mail offers to you, though we may share information about our readership in aggregate with third parties.
Additionally, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your correspondence, including any information or PII contained therein.
You may decline to provide any personal information, but please realize that you thereby may be unable to register for, or participate in, certain of our services.
MY JEWISH LEARNING does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user or member lists or its users’ or members’ names, e-mail addresses or mailing addresses for use by sponsors and other third parties for the purpose of solicitations, unless the user has previously given his or her consent.

MY JEWISH LEARNING recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet, particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in these areas.

MY JEWISH LEARNING primarily utilizes cookies to understand how many of our visitors are repeat visitors or new users and to exclude to the extent possible users from participating more than once in a survey or poll on our Websites. We may also use cookies to remember your password or otherwise to expedite your logging in to our Websites.
Sponsors may elect to use advertising companies to serve their ads on MY JEWISH LEARNING and MY JEWISH LEARNING publications, and sponsors themselves may also place a cookie on a user’s computer.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to fully access and take advantage of some features on our Websites.
