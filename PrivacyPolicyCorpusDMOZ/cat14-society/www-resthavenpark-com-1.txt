About
Each of us possesses a defining element that sets us apart in life. At Resthaven Funeral Home and Resthaven Memorial Park in Shawnee, Oklahoma, we find the cornerstones of a joyfully lived life and highlight them in customized services that truly speak to the life and times of an individual.
Welcome to our Shawnee funeral home
At Resthaven Funeral Home, your stories inspire our team of attentive funeral directors. Start with a lifelong hobby, a timeless style or a closely held quote, and we will work to tastefully integrate details that create a tailored memorial. Imagine one last trip to the links to salute an avid golfer, with a mini-putter set up in the stateroom and inscribed golf ball keepsakes. Envision elegant coffee service for the coffee connoisseur, complete with a barista dressed in their favorite colors. Whatever your idea, our reception area adapts to accommodate guest lists large and small, and our team will do their best to fulfill each final wish.
Leave the catering to us. We provide delicious classics, or prepare fare from your family recipe library so you can spend more time with those who matter most. Our sister location, Resthaven Memorial Park, further reduces transit time to maximize time spent in the company of family and friends.
We Honor Veterans
At Resthaven Funeral Home, we understand the unique needs of America’s veterans and their families. As a Level Four Founding Community Partner with We Honor Veterans, we are honored to serve our nation’s heroes and take this responsibility seriously. We have taken steps to ensure our staff is knowledgeable of all the benefits available to military veterans and their families.
In addition, we host community events annually in honor of our veterans and work closely with local veterans organizations. With respect, integrity and dignity, we will walk you through the steps of creating a veteran’s memorial service that truly honors the life and sacrifice of your loved one.
Resthaven Memorial Park
Whether you choose a traditional religious service with conventional in-ground burial, above-ground entombment or cremation with interment of cremated remains, we consider it a privilege to guide you through your options. Resthaven Memorial Park offers family estates, which provide future generations the reassurance of a single central gathering place to reflect on memories. Gorgeous in granite, our mausoleum joins cremation gardens and niches to accent the Shawnee cemetery nicknamed “Cemetery Beautiful.”
We salute those who served our great nation. Our reserved Veterans’ Garden, replete with a granite veterans’ memorial, is the site of an annual Memorial Day remembrance ceremony to echo tributes at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
History
Neill E. and Mary E. Wiley opened Resthaven Funeral Home in Shawnee, Oklahoma, in 1979 to complement Resthaven Memorial Park, which first opened in 1929. Resthaven became Shawnee's only cemetery with a funeral home on the grounds, run by active community members devoted to countless hours of local improvement.
The Wileys raised their family in the house next door to the funeral home, leaving handprints in the surrounding sidewalks and driveways visible to this day. In 2001, the Shawnee Chamber of Commerce honored the legacy of the Wileys by establishing the annual "Neill and Mary Wiley Award," which recognizes an outstanding volunteer in the community.
In 2006, Resthaven Funeral Home merged with Gaskill-Owens Funeral Home. Many pieces of Gaskill-Owens' antique furniture, paintings and other memorabilia were placed on display in our remodeled family gathering room. Gaskill-Owens' ledger books, dating back to the 1920s, are among the most interesting artifacts.
Today, Resthaven Funeral Home and Resthaven Memorial Park combine the charm and rich heritage of a small-town funeral home and cemetery with the benefits of a trusted network of funeral, cremation and memorialization services through the Dignity Memorial® network. Neill and Mary Wiley began Resthaven with a commitment to a high standard of service, and throughout our history, we've continued to lead and innovate while maintaining that same high standard for our neighbors.
Contact us, day or night
Your satisfaction is our top priority. We invite you to contact us at Resthaven Funeral Home and Resthaven Memorial Park if we may provide assistance with arrangements in Shawnee, or if you would like to schedule a tour of our welcoming chapel and 33-acre cemetery.

"From the moment that we walked into Resthaven, until even now, almost a month later, we have felt so thankful that our father chose this as his final resting place. Scotti and her team helped us with every last detail, and was always quick to respond, even on her time off! She wrote a beautiful eulogy that we only had to tweak, made the most stunning program for the funeral, and even got guitar picks to give to our guests. I am so impressed with the thoughtfulness behind every detail. We felt comfortable enough to laugh, cry, and tell some of our favorite memories with Scotti.
Dustin was also gold star status with his customer service. My grandmother all of a sudden HAD to know about her funeral arrangements in the midst of planning my dad's funeral, and Dustin was kind enough to bring it up and go over it with her. Dustin walked with us to the cemetery several times to ensure that we were getting what we wanted, and discussed every last detail with us. We will be forever grateful to the staff at Resthaven for their time, dedication, and hard work. The funeral was perfect, and we know we have you all to thank for it."
