Privacy Policy
Although the University of Maryland Libraries make every effort to protect
the privacy of user circulation records (including books and Internet searches),
the Libraries may be obligated to release such information to federal law
enforcement agents in response to a search warrant or subpoena issued in
accordance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. 1861, as
amended by the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56). That law prohibits library
staff from informing you that it received such a request. More
