Using cookies on SOCS sites
Filament does not use cookies to retrieve any data from a user’s hard drive, carry computer viruses, capture email addresses or work with online advertisers. A cookie is a small text file that a website can send to a browser which may then be stored on a computer. SOCS sites, like many other websites, use cookies to provide visitors with tailored information from the website. There are two types of cookies used by SOCS:
Session Cookies:
SOCS sites use session cookies for consistency purposes. Once users access a SOCS website, their browser receives a session cookie which has a time stamp on it. As they move around a website, their browser submits the session cookie whenever the browser requests a new web page. This is how the site knows user preferences so the appearance can remain consistent. Once a person leaves the site, the session cookie placed on his or her computer expires and is deleted from the computer. Filament and the SOCS program do not monitor or track any individual’s browsing pattern.
Persistent Cookies:
Persistent cookies help a site remember individuals as a previous visitor and can help a visitor by remembering settings from a previous session. An example is when someone responds to a poll question. A cookie is used to ensure each poll taker votes only once.
Opting out of having cookies placed on a computer
Each user can set their browser to notify them when a cookie is received, giving the user a chance to decide whether to accept it. However, if someone chooses to reject cookies, that person may be prompted to log in multiple times (for those sections that require it) in the same browsing session but retains access to all information. Users can consult their browser documentation to learn how to modify cookie settings.
