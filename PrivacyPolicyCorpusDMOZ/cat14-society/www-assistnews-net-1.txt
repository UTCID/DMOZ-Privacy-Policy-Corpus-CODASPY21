Vision & Mission
No "fake news" here. The Gospel is our motivation. Our passion is to glorify God by reporting on World Missions, the persecuted church, and stories and events that inspire our daily lives for Christ.
ANS was founded by Dan Wooding to inform, educate, and inspire about all that God is doing in today's culture. Assist News mobilizes Christians to intervene on behalf of the persecuted church.
