The call costs the same as a call to a local number. On phoning the number you will hear a short automated message before a brief welcome message from Gareth. You simply hang up at the end, or whenever you're bored with Gareth's sermon. The content will be pre-recorded rather than new material, so if you've been watching our Sunday services online you will have heard this before.
