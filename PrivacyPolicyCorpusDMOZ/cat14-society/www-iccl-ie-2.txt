DonateFind out how you can support our vital workHome / Personal Data
Your personal information is worth a lot to a lot of people. You have
the right to control who sees it. Yet encroachments are made on that
data every day. The government is insisting on having your data before
it will grant you access to services you are entitled to. Corporations
are gathering huge amounts of information about your interests and
preferences, both online and off.
The Public Services
Card is a frightening example of how governments can demand access to
your private, personal data before it will give you your entitlements.
Find out more about ICCL’s campaign to have the card abolished.
Help ICCL keep fighting to protect your personal data. Join us today.
