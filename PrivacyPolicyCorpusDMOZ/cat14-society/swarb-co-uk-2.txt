We use Google Analytics and a WordPress plugin called Jetpack to collect record, and retain the IP address of a visitor and the web pages requested. An IP address might sometimes, in principle, allow the identification of the machine from the page request originated.
This data allows us to identify which pages are most visited, and are worthy of or require further noting up, and to promote the site to attract advertising.
Google analytics bases its analysis on the URL of the page visited, together with the IP address of the browser calling it. Our URLs do not include any additional information. Google asseses a broad geolocation for the location of the browser, but does not seek to identify a user (you). Google Analytics has its privacy policy.
We do retain statistics about the use of the site, but not in a way which comprises data about individual users.
