6. Pay Services.
During COVID-19, MyEvent.com will be holding the funds for tickets or registration for events until 5 days after the event. Partial, early payouts may be considered on a case by case basis by the risk department at MyEvent.com.
Certain of the Services made available over the myevent Site may be offered by myevent on a payment basis (hereinafter referred to as a "Pay Service"), which Pay Service may be offered by myevent on a "prepaid" or on a "pay as you use" basis. Should a User choose to have access to a Pay Services, she/he will be required to register as described in Section 5 above, and such User will be assigned an account for such Pay Service (the "Pay Service Account"). Each User agrees to pay all the fees applicable to such Pay Service, including any fees associated with the use of such Pay Service and any myevent payment service fees listed on the pricing page together with all applicable taxes (collectively, the "Fees"). Unless otherwise indicated on the relevant Pay Service description page (the "Pay Service Description"), all Fees for a Pay Service will be billed immediately to the credit card designated by such User and are non-refundable. myevent reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any Fees for a Pay Service, and to institute new Fees or terms at any time effective upon notice to Users, which notice may for certainty include the posting of any such changes on the relevant pages of the myevent Site related to the use of the Pay Services. In connection with the foregoing, each User warrants that: (a) she/he is of the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which she/he reside, (b) all information she/he submits is true and correct (including without limitation all credit card information), and (c) she/he is the cardholder of the credit card designated by the User for the Pay Service Account. In the event that a certain amount collected by myevent on behalf of the User through the myevent payment service is charged back, the User hereby authorizes myevent to deduct from the funds which have been collected on behalf on the User the amount of the relevant charge back amount + a charge back fee of $20, and, if this is not possible (because the amount of the charge back is greater than the amount of the funds collected on behalf of the User), the User undertakes to repay such payback amount to myevent within five (5) days of myevent's request to do so. In the event that an individual which has purchased a ticket through the myevent's Site wishes to cancel its transaction and be refunded with the payment made, myevent shall only have to make such refund if the funds pertaining to the transaction of this individual have not already been paid out from the account of the User. If the funds pertaining to the transaction of this individual are still in the account of the User, a refund can be issued to the individual, although the amount of the Fees will first be deducted from the amount of the refund.
MyEvent does not prevent clients from saying on their website that their event has a no refund policy, however if there are funds in your account and the person who made a transaction on your account requests a refund, we will refund the transaction even if you have written on your website that your event or campaign has a no refund policy. This is because banks will issue chargebacks if the cardholder said they requested a refund and could not get it (regardless of the policy for that specific event).
MyEvent reserves the right to withhold the payout of funds for any reason for any account or event where the MyEvent risk department determines a specific account or event to be higher in risk. In such cases the event organizer will have the option to either wait until the MyEvent risk department releases the funds for payout, or to have all the relevant transactions refunded minus fees.
MyEvent reserves the right to withhold the payout of funds prior to an event for any account or event where the MyEvent risk department determines a specific account or event to be higher in risk. In such cases, MyEvent may request additional information about the organizer and other event suppliers in order to satisfy the MyEvent risk department's concerns. Once satisfied, MyEvent may pay out a portion of the funds prior to the event. In such cases the event organizer will have the option to either wait until the MyEvent risk department releases the funds for payout, or to have all the relevant transactions refunded minus fees.
MyEvent cannot be used to accept payment for travel related services including reservations for hotels, flights, cruiseswithout having a significant hold on funds until the event has passed. For more information contact MyEvent to discuss this option.
Please keep in mind that if you are accepting donations, selling tickets, using the online auction, sponsor's page or using any of the MyEvent Pay Services there is a 2 week hold on transactions before payouts. The silent auction can only be used by registered charities and those approved by our risk department. We reserve the right to hold back payout until the person who purchased the items has received the auction items. Myevent must charge applicable taxes to Canadians on all fees associated with accepting payments. These fees come out of the gross amount collected.
