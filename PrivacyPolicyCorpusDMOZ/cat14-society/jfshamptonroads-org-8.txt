Planned Giving
Let your gift last more than a lifetime by leaving a deferred gift to JFS. A strong endowment ensures that JFS will be able to deliver essential services for generations to come. Planned gifts made as bequests, annuities or trusts allow you to support JFS while enjoying favorable tax considerations or lifetime income. The Jewish Family Service Foundation Inc. was established to assist committed JFS supporters in their philanthropic intent to leave a lasting legacy with the agency and those it serves.
Tidewater Jewish Foundation was selected to participate in the Harold Grinspoon Foundation’s Life & Legacy program. This is a four-year program that assists communities, through partnerships with Jewish Federations and Foundations, to promote after-lifetime giving to benefit local Jewish day schools, synagogues, social service organizations, and other Jewish entities. JFS is fortunate to have been selected to participate in this initiative.
