Who we are
The Life Project (operator of www.thelife.com) is a ministry of Power to Change Ministries (P2C), which in turn is part of Campus Crusade for Christ International (CCCI), a worldwide evangelistic and discipleship ministry with representative local ministries in over 160 countries. P2C is comprised of P2C as well as a number of local ministries that operate within P2C. Throughout this document “we” and “ours” refers to the organization as a whole as well as to individual field ministries, and “you” and “yours” refers to any and all ministry partners and public site users.
Our commitment to you
We are committed to protecting and appropriately handling private and personal information and take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, process, use, disclose, and share your personal information or personal data.
How we protect your information
The security of your information is important to us. P2C has implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser when finished using P2C websites on a shared or unsecured device.
Some of our systems involve the storage and processing of your personally identifiable information outside of Canada using the services of third party service providers. Although we have undertaken measures, including obtaining contractual commitments, to safeguard your personally identifiable information whenever it is shared with other parties, if your personally identifiable information is stored or processed outside of Canada, it will also be subject to the laws of those other jurisdictions.
However, this does NOT apply to personal data – including sender and/or recipient e-mail addresses — contained in ordinary e-mail notes while these are en route between your computer and our servers, during which time these notes must be considered public data.
We will never send you e-mail notes containing any sensitive or private information such as credit card details, and strongly urge you to never place such information in emails.
The information we collect from or about you
