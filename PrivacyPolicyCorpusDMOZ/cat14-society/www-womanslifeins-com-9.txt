Terms of UseFor Victims of Domestic Violence and Endangered Individuals
According to New York Insurance Law §2612 if any person covered by an insurance policy issued to another person who is the policyholder
has a valid order of protection against the policyholder or other person, Woman’s Life is prohibited for the duration of the order
from disclosing to the policyholder or other person the address and telephone number of the insured, or of any person or
entity providing covered services to the insured. If a child is the covered person, the right shall also extend to the parent or
guardian of the child.
If a valid order of protection is received by home office, an agent, representative, or any other person with whom Woman’s Life
contracts or who has gained access to the information from Woman’s Life, with regard to the solicitation, negotiation, or
sale of insurance or the adjustment of insurance claims, Woman’s Life will not make any further inquiry regarding
its justification. Once received, Woman’s Life will restrict the protected party’s address, phone number, or
any other personally identifying information of the covered individual or any child residing with the covered individual
until the order is terminated by its own terms or by a court.
If a victim of domestic violence or a covered individual wishes to provide an alternative address, telephone number, or other method of contact,
they may contact Woman’s Life at (800) 521-9292 to provide that information.
