TERMS OF USE
THIS WEBSITE DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE. The materials on this website have been prepared by Fredrikson & Byron, P.A. and its consulting subsidiaries (Fredrikson) for informational purposes only. Accessing this website is a request for information.
The information you read on this website is for your general education, and cannot replace the relationship that you have with your attorney. Legal information changes quickly. Therefore, some information on this website may be out of date. In addition, some of the legal information on this website may be specific to the laws of the state of Minnesota and may not apply in other states or countries. Your use of the information on this website does not create an attorney-client or any other contractual relationship between you and Fredrikson.
The service marks, logos, graphics, and other materials on this website belong to Fredrikson, and are protected by United States copyright and trademark laws. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.
From time to time we may provide links to other websites not operated by Fredrikson. We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the materials on any other websites. We are not responsible for the performance of those websites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other websites is subject to the terms of use of those websites, including their privacy policies.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR VISITORS FROM IOWA
The determination of the need for legal services and the choice of a lawyer are extremely important decisions and should not be based solely upon advertisements or self-proclaimed expertise. A description or indication of limitation of practice does not mean that any agency or board has certified such lawyer as a specialist or expert in an indicated field of law practice, nor does it mean that such lawyer is necessarily any more expert or competent than any other lawyer. All potential clients are urged to make their own independent investigation and evaluation of any lawyer being considered. This notice is required by rule of the Supreme Court of Iowa.
