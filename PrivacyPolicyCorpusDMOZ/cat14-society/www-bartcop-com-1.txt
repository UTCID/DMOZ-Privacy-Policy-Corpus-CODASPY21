Privacy Policy
At BartCop.com, we respect your privacy
and are committed to safeguarding your privacy while online at our sites
www.bartcop.com and bartblog.bartcop.com. The following discloses the information
gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site. We never
sell your personal information to third parties.
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This
includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and
number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s
movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable
information.
Cookies and Web Beacons
A
cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer
tied to information about the user. Our site use cookies for tracking visitors’ activity
and other uses that might include only showing
you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some specific
features. Some of our business partners use cookies
on our site (for example, advertisers). Some of these
advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they
advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as
Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP
address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for
geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New
York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited
(such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
However,
we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given
permission for them to set cookies for advertising. You can choose not
to accept cookies by modifying your browser settings. At any time, you
may remove any cookie stored on your hard drive by deleting them in your
browser’s settings section.
Advertisers
We use outside ad companies to display ads on our site. These ads may contain
cookies and are collected by the ad companies, and we do not have access to
these information. We work with the ad companies: Google Adsense, Feedburner
and blogads. Please check their websites for respective privacy policies.

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are
not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage
our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
statements of
every Web site that collects personally identifiable
information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected
by this Web site.
