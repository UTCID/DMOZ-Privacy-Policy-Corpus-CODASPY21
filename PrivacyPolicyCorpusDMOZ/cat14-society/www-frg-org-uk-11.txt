ACCOMMODATION
ACCOMMODATION
Accommodation is when a child or young person is cared for by Children’s Services because:
there is no-one with parental responsibility for them or
they have been lost or abandoned or
the person normally caring for them is unable to provide them with suitable accommodation or care (whether this is temporary or permanent), for whatever reason. This is also known as section 20.
However:
Children's Services may not provide accommodation for a child if someone with parental responsibility objects and can provide accommodation themselves or arrange for someone else to provide accommodation;
A person with parental responsibility can remove a child from accommodation at any time (although there are some exceptions to this). It is essential to take legal advice first before doing this.
Before or immediately after a child is accommodated by Children’s Services, the social worker should draw up a care plan for the child and should get the agreement of their parents or those with parental responsibility or the young person themselves if they are aged 16 or 17 to the plan. If there is no parent/person with parental responsibility and the young person is under 16, they can ask the last person caring for the child if they agree with the child's care plan.
The care plan should set out how the accommodation arrangement can be ended and what the contact arrangements are whilst the child is away from home.
There is no court order when a child is accommodated and Children's Services does not have parental responsibility for them.
If a child is ‘accommodated' it means he or she is being ‘looked after'.
For more information see: advice sheets: 4: Family Support; 13: Contact with children in accommodation and 11: Duties on Children’s Services towards children in the care system.

ADOPTION
ADOPTION
When a child is adopted they become a member of their new adoptive family legally and they stop being legally related to their birth family. Adoption therefore changes a child's legal relationships.
Adoption can only happen if a court orders it. The court has the power to order adoption even if the parents don’t agree, if it considers this is best for the child.
However a child cannot be placed for adoption unless either the parents (who have parental responsibility) have given their formal consent to this (which must be witnessed by an officer of the court) or the court has made a placement order. This is not the same as foster for adoption.

ADOPTION CONTACT REGISTER
ADOPTION CONTACT REGISTER
The adoption contact register helps adopted people who are over 18 and their birth relatives to get in touch with each other, if they both want to. These people can put their details on the register and say if they would like to make contact with someone in their birth family. They can also say if they do not want to have contact with such a person. To find out more read here about using the adoption contact register.
Goto Top
ADOPTION PANEL
ADOPTION PANEL
An adoption panel must be set up by each adoption agency to advise on some decisions relating to the adoption of children.
Adoption panels have two main jobs:
they consider the suitability of people who want to adopt children; and
they match a child who has a plan for adoption with suitable people to adopt him/her.
Panels can also offer advice on various related issues, such as contact arrangements and support plans.
Panels make recommendations which the agency must take account of. However, final decisions are made by the agency decision maker – this is usually a senior manager in Children’s Services.
Remember, even if there is a plan for adoption, a child cannot be placed for adoption against the wishes of the parents without a placement order being made by the court.
For more information see: advice sheet 23: Adoption
Goto Top
ADOPTION ORDER
ADOPTION ORDER
An adoption order is a court order which makes the child legally part of the adoptive family and legally ends a child’s relationship with their birth family. It is a permanent order, lasting for the child’s lifetime. It cannot be changed once it has been made.
For more information see: advice sheet 23: Adoption
Goto Top
ADVOCATE
ADVOCATE
An advocate is someone who is independent of Children’s Services who can help children, young people, parents and other family members to have a voice when social workers are involved with their family. They can:
attend meetings with that person
write letters or make telephone calls on their behalf to Children’s Services
help them put their point of view across and
help them understand what is going on.
Children's Services must provide advocacy services for children and young people in some circumstances. They should also have details of other local advocacy services.
There are not many advocacy services for parents but there are some projects which specialise in helping parents with learning disabilities or parents who are experiencing mental illness or domestic abuse to be heard.
Family Rights Group also has a small advocacy project which supports some families involved with Children’s Services about the care and protection of their children. Social workers can purchase this service for parents and other family members to help them participate in meetings. More details about the advocacy project can be found here.
Family Rights Group’s advice line can explain how to look for an advocate or solicitor and give more information about how they work.
For more information see: advice sheet 10: Advocacy for families in local authority decision-making.

AGENCY DECISION MAKER
AGENCY DECISION MAKER
The Agency "Decision Maker" (also known as the ADM) is a very senior member of staff within the adoption agency who has the responsibility for running the agency’s adoption service.
The ADM’s responsibilities include deciding whether a child should be adopted. When deciding this, they must look at all the information in the child’s permanence report and also in any other reports about the child’s needs and their family circumstances that have been prepared by the social worker or other professionals.
When making this decision, it is good practice that the ADM lists all the reports and other information that they have taken into account and they should set out their reasons for making their decision. If they don’t, their decision could be challenged by lawyers for the parents or the child.
At present a child cannot be placed for adoption with people who want to adopt him/her unless their parents (who have parental responsibility) formally agree or the court makes a placement order.
If you have heard that Children’s Services are thinking that your child should be adopted or they are thinking of placing them with foster carers who might go on to adopt them (foster for adoption), you should take legal advice urgently.
Find a solicitor specialising in family law here. It is a good idea to choose a solicitor who is knowledgeable and experienced in this area and who is a member of the Law Society's Children Law Accreditation Scheme.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
The law encourages people who are thinking about going to court, or those who are already involved in court proceedings, to try to find solutions to their difficulties without the court having to decide the issue for them. Examples of alternative dispute resolution in children’s cases include family mediation and Family Group Conferences.
Both of these are services run by trained people, who are independent of everyone else in the case and are not on anyone’s side. They try to get everyone to agree a way forward. Sometimes the judge will stop a case (“adjourn”) to give the parties a chance to try alternative dispute resolution, but the judge cannot make them do this if they don’t want to.

APPROVED FOSTER CARER
APPROVED FOSTER CARER
An approved foster carer is someone who has been assessed by Children’s Services to become a foster carer and has been approved by a Fostering Panel. They may be approved to care for a specific child or generally to be a foster carer for any child.
Relatives and friends can be assessed and approved as foster carers for a child in their family who is looked after and needs to be placed.
If a child needs to be placed with a relative, friend or other connected person straight away and there is no time to do a full fostering assessment, they may be assessed and approved as a foster carer temporarily, provided some immediate checks being carried out by the social worker. But afterwards, they still need to undergo a full fostering assessment for the child to remain with them long term.
If the child cannot be placed with a relative, friend or connected person, then they can be placed with an unrelated foster carer.
Note: A child who is looked after by Children’s Services cannot be placed with a person who is not an approved foster carer.

ASSESSMENT
ASSESSMENT
This is the name for the detailed assessment of the child and their family’s circumstances, to see if they need any help. It is prepared by a social worker. It looks at the child’s needs, the parents’ ability to meet those needs and the family’s general situation.
An assessment is usually carried out as a part of Child Protection enquiries or before a Child in Need plan is drawn up. It should be done in time to meet the child’s needs and always within 45 working days of the referral.
For more information please see: advice sheet 4: Family support services.

CAFCASS
CAFCASS
CAFCASS stands for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. This is an independent court based agency. Through its Family Court Advisors (also sometimes referred to as CAFCASS officers) it advises the family courts in England on what it considers to be in the best interests of the child during family law cases.

CARE
CARE
A child is “in care” when they are under an interim (temporary) or full care order or an emergency protection order.
In these circumstances, the Children’s Services Department named in the order shares parental responsibility for the child with their parents. Children's Services must find out the parents wishes about any decision they make about their child, but they have the final say and can make plans for the child even if the parents don't agree with them.

CARE CASES
CARE CASES Care cases refers to cases in ‘care proceedings’ which is the name for the court process when children’s services go to court because they are concerned that a child is not safe. In care cases, children’s services can ask the court to make an order to protect the child.Goto Top
CARE ORDER
CARE ORDER
This is a court order which places a child in the care of Children’s Services. It lasts until the child is 18 unless the court ends it before then.
When there is a care order, Children's Services share parental responsibility for the child with the parents. Children's Services must find out the parents wishes about any decision they make about their child, but they always have the final say and can make plans for the child even if the parents don't agree with them.

CARE PLAN
CARE PLAN
A care plan is the written plan that sets out the arrangements for a child who is looked after. Before it is drawn up, the social worker must:
find out the wishes and feelings of the parent, the child and other significant people in the child's life and
carry out an assessment of the child’s needs (following the locoal protocol for assessment) so that services are provided to make sure the child’s identified needs are met, including their:
health
education
emotional and behavioural development
identity
need for contact with other people in the family
The care plan will also set out
where the child will live and why this is good for the child – this is also written down in the child’s placement plan (which sets out the arrangements in the placement, for example what the carer can decide in terms of the child staying overnight with friends etc.)
the long term or permanent plans for the child and

CARE PROCEEDINGS
CARE PROCEEDINGS
Care proceedings is the name for the court process when Children’s Services go to court because they are concerned that a child is not safe. In care proceedings, Children’s Services can ask the court to make an order to protect the child, such as an Emergency Protection Order, an Interim Care Order or a Care Order.
If any of these orders are made, Children's Services share parental responsibility for the child with the parents. Children's Services must find out parents wishes about any decision concerning their child, but they have the final say and can make plans for the child even if the parents don't agree with them.

CASE MANAGEMENT HEARING (CMH)
CASE MANAGEMENT HEARING (CMH)
This is a court hearing during care proceedings. Court Guidance says it must normally be held between 12 to 18 days of the application being made for a Care Order.
The purpose of the CMH hearing is for the court to look carefully at the care plan, identify key issues, see whether directions given at earlier court hearings have been complied with and what further directions are still needed to prepare the case for the final hearing.
The court may also give directions for the assessment of family members as possible future carers of the child or preparation of expert evidence at this hearing if this has not already happened.
The court will also consider whether there needs to be a hearing to decide whether there should be an interim care order.
For more information see: advice sheet 15: Care proceedings.

CHILD ARRANGEMENTS ORDER
CHILD ARRANGEMENTS ORDER
This is a new order made under s.8 Children Act 1989. There are two types of child arrangements orders (CAOs) that can be made:
An order which says where and with whom a child will live. It used to be called a s.8 'Residence Order'; and
An order which says who the child can spend time with and for how long. This used to be called a s. 8 'Contact Order'.
A Child Arrangements Order saying where and with whom a child should live can also say that the child can live with more than one person and it will say for how long the child is with each person (for example where grandparents and a parent are raising the child either together at the same address or at separate addresses for different parts of the week).
This order gives 'parental responsibility' to the person who the order says the child will live with (if they don't already have it) for as long as the order is in force. If you have this order, (and you are not the child's parent), you can normally make decisions about the child's care and upbringing without having to consult with their parents. However, it is still a good idea to discuss important things with the parents, as it will benefit the child if everyone who has an interest in their upbringing can agree. But note there are some things you cannot decide including:
taking the child outside the UK for more than one month;
changing the child's surname without the agreement of their parents and anyone else with parental responsibility or the permission of the court;
appointing a guardian for the child to raise them after your death; and
consenting to the child being placed for adoption or being adopted.
Goto Top
CHILD ARRANGEMENTS ORDER ALLOWANCE
CHILD ARRANGEMENTS ORDER ALLOWANCE
This is when Children's Services give financial help to someone with a Child Arrangements Order (saying the child should live with them) who is not a parent, or married to one.
They don't have to pay this allowance, it is discretionary. Any payments they do make will be means tested and the rate of a Child Arrangements Order Allowance should be no less than the core child fostering allowance under the same local authority's Fostering Scheme.
These allowances are usually reviewed on a regular basis. The details of how much they pay and the criteria they use to decide who they will help should be set out in your local Children's Services' family and friends care policy.
If you are caring for a child under a Child Arrangements Order and you are not a parent, you could ask Children's Services for a copy of the Family and Friends care policy and what you need to do to get a Child Arrangements Order allowance.

CHILD ASSESSMENT ORDER
CHILD ASSESSMENT ORDER
This is a court order which allows the social worker to insist on a child being assessed for example by a doctor or some other professional.
A social worker can ask the court for a Child Assessment Order if the social worker thinks the child needs to be assessed and the parent won’t agree. The social worker can only do this if they have good reason to believe that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer “significant harm”.
The Child Assessment Order lasts for seven days and cannot be extended.

CHILD IN NEED
CHILD IN NEED
A child is in need if s/he is under 18 and either
s/he needs extra help from Children’s Services to be safe and healthy or to develop properly; or
s/he is disabled.
Children’s Services decide if a child is in need by assessing their needs. If they decide the child is in need they will normally draw up a plan setting out what extra help they will provide to the child and their family. This is called a child in need plan. The plan should also say when and how the plan will be reviewed.

CHILD IN NEED ASSESSMENT
CHILD IN NEED ASSESSMENT
A parent or carer who thinks that their child may be in need can ask Children’s Services to carry out a child in need assessment. A social worker will complete an assessment

If they decide the child is in need the social worker will normally draw up a plan setting out what extra help they will provide to the child and their family and what other agencies will provide. This is called a child in need plan.The plan should also say what outcomes are expected for the child and what is expected of the parent, and also when and how the plan will be reviewed.

CHILD IN NEED PLAN
If an assessment finds that a child is not at risk but is in need of social work services, a child in need plan involving other agencies involved with the family should be developed and agreed with the child's parents at a child in need planning meeting.
The plan should set out what is working well within the family as well as any concerns, and be clear about which agencies will provide which services to the child and family. The plan should describe clear outcomes for the child and what is expected of the parents.
If parents are unable to agree to the child in need plan the social worker should be clear about what action the local authority may then take.

CHILD PROTECTION ENQUIRIES/INVESTIGATIONS
CHILD PROTECTION ENQUIRIES/INVESTIGATIONS
Children’s Services have a legal duty to look into a child's situation if they have information that a child may be at risk of significant harm. This is called a child protection enquiry or investigation. Sometimes it is called a “Section 47 investigation” after the section of the Children Act 1989 which sets out this duty.
The purpose of the enquires is to gather information about the child and their family so that social workers can decide what action, if any, they need to take to keep a child safe and promote their welfare.For more information and what is involved see: advice sheet 9: Child protection procedures.

CHILD PROTECTION CONFERENCE
CHILD PROTECTION CONFERENCE
This is a meeting which takes place between local authority Children’s Services, other professionals who are in contact with the child, and family members. It happens within 15 days of the strategy discussion if a child is considered to be at risk of significant harm.
Those at the meeting (conference) discuss the risk to the child and decide what needs to happen, if anything, to make sure they are kept safe. See also Initial Child Protection Conference and Child Protection Review Conference.
For more information see: advice sheet 9: Child protection procedures.

CHILD PROTECTION CONFERENCE CHAIR
CHILD PROTECTION CONFERENCE CHAIR
The chair of a child protection conference is a senior social worker whose job it is to run the conference. They will be independent of the child’s case and will not be involved in managing the child’s social worker or their manager.
With the help of the people at the conference, the chair decides if the child should have a Child Protection Plan, and if so, what should be on it. This plan sets out the problems the child is having and what must  be done by whom to make sure those problems do not continue and that the child is safe. The details of what will be done and who will do it will be developed by the lead social worker and at later meetings of the core group.
The Chair sets the date for first review meeting and normally chairs that and all other review meetings.

When there is a child protection plan, the child will  be given a social worker who should meet regularly with the child and the parents to discuss the child's progress. The child's situation and the plan will be reviewed after three months and then every six months.
For more information see: advice sheet 9: Child protection procedures.

CHILD PROTECTION REVIEW CONFERENCE
CHILD PROTECTION REVIEW CONFERENCE
The purpose of the child protection review conference is to look at whether or not there are still serious concerns about the safety of the child and how well the parents can care for them and keep them safe. In other words, the review conference looks at whether the child is still suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm.
The review conference can agree that the child doesn’t need a child protection plan any longer. Or, the conference might decide that the child protection plan needs changing, or that the child should have the same child protection plan.
The first child protection review conference is held three months after the initial Child Protection Conference. After that, review conferences are held every six months. Usually these meetings will be chaired by the same person who chaired the initial conference, and the same professionals will be invited to attend.

CHILDREN'S ADVOCATE
CHILDREN'S ADVOCATE
A children’s advocate is an independent person who works with a child to help them make sure they understand what is happening and that their wishes and feeling are heard. This may be by:
going with the child to meetings at Children’s Services offices or
making sure the child’s point of view is put forward in other ways, like writing letters or making complaints.
In some situations, children have a right to have an advocate, for example, children who are in care or children who wish to make a complaint about Children’s Services.
Although children’s advocates are independent of the social worker they are organised and paid for by Children’s Services. All Children’s Services departments should have a Children’s Rights Officer who is responsible for providing advocacy for children. You can ask them to help you find an advocate for your child.
Sometimes advocacy for children is also available through an outside agency such as
National Youth Advocacy Service or
Barnardos.

A children’s guardian is an independent and experienced social worker who is an officer of the court. Their job is to make enquiries (when asked to do so by the Judge) about the child’s circumstances and make a recommendation about what is best for the child in the future. Children's Guardians are organised by a service known as CAFCASS.
If there is an application for an Emergency Protection Order or a Care Order or anything related to that, the court will automatically appoint a guardian for the child. If there is an application for another type of order about the care of the child like a Child Arrangements Order or Special Guardianship Order the court may decide to appoint a guardian if the case is complex.

COMMON ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (CAF)
COMMON ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (CAF)
When a child and family would benefit from co-ordinated support from more than one agency, but they do not need a social worker, there should be an inter-agency assessment of the child and family's needs. An assessment tool often used by agencies such as education, health, or housing is the Common Assessment Framework. This is a standard way of looking at a child's needs and is carried out by a 'lead professional' - someone from the agency working most closely with the child.
The Common Assessment Framework is completely voluntary, so a parent and the child must agree for it to be carried out and also who they would like it to be shared with. But if parents don't agree to it being carried out, then the lead professional may decide that the child's needs are greater than previously thought and that they need to make a formal referral to Children's Services.

CONCURRENT PLANNING
CONCURRENT PLANNING
This is a planning process used in potential adoption cases. It aims to limit the number of moves for a child.
It is used when social workers think that a child (usually a baby) may not be able to stay with its birth parents or family long term. In this situation, if the child becomes looked after (either with the parents agreement or because the court has made a care order or emergency protection order) they place the child with specially trained foster carers who could look after them long term or even adopt them if they can’t go back home safely within a few months.
These foster carers are supported to care for the baby whilst the birth family are given intensive support and have regular contact with their child. If the parents succeed in improving their parenting, then the baby returns to them. Otherwise, these foster carers apply to adopt the child.

This is a legal term which means a relative or friend or someone else who is connected with a looked after child. It can include someone who knows the child in another role like a teacher, a childminder or a neighbour.
The law says that, if Children's Services don't think it is safe for a looked after child to be placed with either of their parents, they should give preference to placing the child with a relative, friend or connected person (who is an approved foster carer) over placing them with unconnected foster carers.

CONTACT
CONTACT
Contact is the word used for keeping in touch with a child who is living away from their parents or other family members. Contact may be face-to-face meetings, telephone calls, letters, texts, cards, sending photos, social media or digital forms of communication such as skype or email etc.
When a child is in care (i.e.: under a care or emergency protection order), Children’s Services must allow them "reasonable contact" with their parent/others with parental responsibility provided it is safe to do so. They should also help them to have contact with other members of the family including their siblings, grandparents etc. Children's Services have to get the court's permission to completely stop a parent from having contact when they are in care.
When a child is accommodated, Children's Services must try to ‘promote’ contact between the child and their parents and other people in the family provided it is safe.
For more information see: advice sheets 14: Contact with children in care and 13: Contact with children accommodated by Children's Services.

CONTACT ORDER
CONTACT ORDER
This is a court order which says who the child should see or keep in touch with. It may include direct direct contact, like visits, but sometimes by it may involve indirect contact, like letters or phone calls. The court can also decide things like where the contact will take place, if it should be supervised, and how often it happens.
A contact order might be made for a parent, a grandparent or a sibling or other relative. It could be for a child living at home, or a child in Care.
If a child is in accommodation and there is a disagreement about how much a child sees a family member, they may apply to the court for a Child Arrangements Order saying who the child will see, although this is unusual.
Also, a contact order made in private law proceedings (legal proceedings between two private individuals where the local authority is not a party) is now called a Child Arrangements Order (saying who the child should see).

DIRECT PAYMENTS
DIRECT PAYMENTS
Direct payments (cash) can be paid to the parents of disabled children, to disabled 16 and 17 year olds and to disabled adults. These payments allow them to buy the care services they need directly from the service provider. They are usually only made if there has been an assessment of the persons' needs and a decision by Adult or Children's Services that they need extra support.

There are two parts to DLA. Money is paid to people who need help to
look after themselves (care) and/or
to get around (mobility).
Carers of children can be paid DLA if their child is disabled and qualifies. You can only make a new application for DLA if it is for a child under 16. Otherwise if the recipient is over 16 (and 64 or under) you can apply for a PIP.

EARLY HELP ASSESSMENT
EARLY HELP ASSESSMENT
Children and families may need support from a wide range of local agencies as soon as a problem emerges at any stage in a child's life. Where a child and family would benefit from co-ordinated support from more than one agency (e.g. education, health, housing, police) but they do not need a social worker, there should be an inter-agency early assessment led by a 'lead professional' - someone from the agency working most closely with the child
An early help assessment is completely voluntary, so a parent and the child must agree for it to be carried out and also who they would like it to be shared with. But if parents don't agree to this being carried out, then the lead professional may decide that the child's needs are greater than previously thought and that they need to make a formal referral to Children's Services.

EDUCATION, HEALTH AND CARE NEEDS ASSESSMENT
EDUCATION, HEALTH AND CARE NEEDS ASSESSMENT
An EHC (Education, Health and Care) needs assessment is not just an educational assessment. It is an assessment of the education, health care and social care needs of the child or young person. This means that consideration must be given to whether a social care assessment or additional health assessments are needed.A EHC assessment of a child's needs can be requested by:
the child's parents or carers,
the child or young person themselves if they are aged 16-25,
their school/early years setting or post-16 institution, and
others who know the child/young person, such as foster carers, youth offending teams or a family friend.
When the local authority is deciding whether to carry out an EHC assessment, it has to consult the child's parents/carers or the young person and then tell them if they are carrying out the assessment.
The assessment will consider the child or young person’s needs, the provision to meet those needs and the outcomes that are expected to be achieved.
When carrying out the assessment, the social worker will gather information from:
the child’s parent or the young person;
the child’s school or college;
their doctor or other health care professional;
an educational psychologist;
They must also seek advice and information in relation to social care and advice and information from any other person the local authority thinks is appropriate; as well as advice and information from any person the child’s parent or young person reasonably requests that the local authority seek advice from.The assessment will help the local authority decide if the child needs an Education, Health and Care plan.
EDUCATION, HEALTH AND CARE PLANS (EHC PLANS)
EDUCATION, HEALTH AND CARE PLANS (EHC PLANS) From 1st September 2014, Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans were introduced for young people aged 0-25 who have Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND).  These are prepared by the local authority and are intended to ensure there is co-ordination between the agencies meeting children’s different education, health and social care needs.
EHC plans replace Statements of Special Education Needs (Statement of SEN) which were previously used to assess and plan additional support for children with SEND.
EHC plans are not the same as child in need plans – they can both exist at the same time, although the agencies involved should each need to know what each plan says.
To get an EHC plan, the child’s needs will first be assessed to see what additional SEND support they need.  The EHC plan will then state what the child/young person’s special educational needs are, if any; the outcomes being sought for the child; the special educational needs provision the child requires; and any extra health care and social care provision required to assist with meeting the child’s SEND.
A SEND assessment of a child’s needs can be requested by:
the child’s parents or carers,
the child or young person themselves if they are aged 16-25,
their school/early years setting or post-16 institution, and
others who know the child/young person, such as foster carers, youth offending teams or a family friend.
When the local authority is deciding whether to carry out an EHC assessment, it has to consult the child’s parents/carers or the young person and then tell them if they are carrying out the assessment.
If you are the parent or carer of a child or young person being assessed to see if they have SEND, then the local authority must consult you and the young person and have regard to you and the child’s views, wishes and feelings, your aspirations, and the outcomes you wish to seek and the support you need to achieve them throughout the process of assessment and preparing the plan. It is therefore very important that you and your child tell them what you want. They should also keep you informed of what is happening throughout the process.

EMERGENCY PROTECTION ORDER
EMERGENCY PROTECTION ORDER
If Children’s Services believes a child is in urgent need of protection, it can ask the court to make an Emergency Protection Order. An Emergency Protection Order lasts for up to eight days and can be extended by the court once for a further seven days.
An Emergency Protection Order gives Children Services the power to
remove a child from home and take them into care
prevent a child from returning to the parent’s care, for example to stop a child being taken home from hospital
exclude someone else from the child’s home (if the parent who lives there agrees and this is written on the order as an exclusion requirement).
see the child without the parent’s permission and
make a direction for a medical or psychiatric examination of the child.
In exceptional circumstances, an Emergency Protection Order can be made at a hearing that the parents do not know about (called “without notice”). If this happens, the parent can ask the court to end (“discharge”) the Emergency Protection Order.
They should seek legal advice about it from a specialist childcare solicitor. Find a specialist solicitor here. It is a good idea to choose a solicitor who is knowledgeable and experienced in this area and who is a member of the Law Society's Children Law Accreditation Scheme.

constantly putting the child down or making them feel unloved or useless
bullying
letting a child see or hear someone else being ill treated, for example the child witnessing violence at home
expecting too much of a child for their age, or being over protective
failing to protect them from abuse by someone else.

FAMILY AND FRIENDS CARE
FAMILY AND FRIENDS CARE
A friends and family carer is a relative, friend or other connected person who is looking after a child that cannot live with his/her parents. Sometimes they are known as kinship carers.
If the social worker was involved in arranging for the child to live with the family and friends carer, the child is likely to be looked after. If they were not, then it is likely to be a private arrangement. However, in some cases carers apply for Child Arrangements Orders (saying the child should live with them) or Special Guardianship Orders.
The availability of support varies according to the type of legal arrangement.

FAMILY GROUP CONFERENCE (FGC)
FAMILY GROUP CONFERENCE (FGC)
A Family Group Conference is a decision-making meeting in which the wider family makes plans for children who need support and often protection. It is a voluntary process and families cannot be forced to have an FGC.
Families are assisted by an independent coordinator to prepare for the meeting.
They have the chance to get information from the social worker and other professionals about the child’s needs and what will keep them safe.
The whole family then meet on their own to make a plan for their child/ren which takes account of any safety concerns explained by the social worker.
The family should be supported to carry out the plan, unless it would place the child at risk of significant harm.

Foster carers have to be assessed and approved by Children's Services to before a looked after child can be placed with them. They may be approved as a temporary foster carer or a fully approved foster carer. They do not have parental responsibility for the child. They offer the child a place in their home and have responsibility for the daily care of the child.Family members and friends can be assessed and approved by the local authority to become foster carers for the child. If you want a family member or friend to care for your child in this way, you should speak to the child's social worker about it straight away.

Family and friends carers should not be paid less than unrelated foster carers, including any additional payments.

FOSTERING ASSESSMENT
FOSTERING ASSESSMENT
Before anyone can become a foster carer, they must be assessed and approved by Children's Services. Children’s Services must place looked after children with approved foster carers in order for the placement to be lawful.
There are three types of approval as a foster carer:
Temporary approval: This is known as a regulation 24 placement. This is available for relatives, friends or other connected persons. The social worker must find out key information about the relative/friend or other connected person and their household before (or immediately after) the placement in order to give temporary approval. The approval, once given, will last for 16 weeks, although it can be extended to 24 weeks in exceptional circumstances. During that time the relative/friend or other connected person must be fully assessed and approved as a foster carer for the placement to continue beyond that time. If they are not approved within that time period the child must be moved to another placement.
Temporary approval of approved adopters to foster a child for whom adoption is being considered: This is called a fostering for adoption placement. In order to consider making a fostering for adoption placement, Children's Services must:• be considering adoption for the child;• have decided that this is the most appropriate placement for the child having established that there is no suitable placement within the child's family network;• have considered whether the placement will safeguard and promote the child's welfare, be in their best interests and meets their needs set out in the care plan; and• have assessed and approved the prospective adopters suitability to care for the child as a foster parent.
Full fostering assessment and approval: This is a detailed process made up of four main parts which include criminal records checks, health checks, references and the carer's family's circumstances including their home environment and their ability to meet a child's needs. This is the process that applies both to unconnected foster carers and relatives friends and connected persons who wish to care for a child long term. Family and friends carers will usually be assessed on how they can care for and protect a specific child.
When the full fostering assessment is finished the information gathered will be presented to a fostering panel for a recommendation about approval. If the proposed carer is not approved you can challenge this by writing to the local authority or asking for a review by the Independent Review mechanism.
For more information see: advice sheet 22: Family and Friends care: becoming a foster carer.

FOSTERING FOR ADOPTION
FOSTERING FOR ADOPTION
Foster for adoption is a new practice which has been introduced to enable young children (and especially babies) to be placed with people who have been approved as prospective adopters and also as temporary foster carers. The child is placed with them on a temporary fostering basis even though their long term future has not necessarily been decided by a court. The idea is that they will bond as early as possible with people who may go on to adopt them. It is used when adoption is being considered for looked after children because they are unlikely to be raised by their parents or relatives in the long term.
If:
your child is a baby (or very young), AND
they are looked after in the care system (either with your agreement or the agreement of their other parent/someone else with parental responsibility or under an emergency protection order or a care order) AND
the social worker thinks you and your relatives won't be able to care for them long term,
the social worker must explore alternative plans for your baby's long term care. This may include your baby being adopted if the court agrees this is the best plan for them.
If the social worker is considering adoption for your baby, they are under a duty to consider placing your child with approved foster carers who are also approved as prospective adopters. If the court decides your child cannot stay in your family long term, these carers might go on to apply to adopt them if the court decides that adoption is in your child's best interests. It can be very difficult to argue that your baby should return to your family once she has settled with 'foster for adoption' foster carers.
If it has been mentioned in your case it is essential that you get a solicitor straight away and that, if you have not already done so, you find out if there is anyone in your family who might be suitable to care for your child. If there is, tell the social worker and your solicitor immediately.

FOSTERING PANEL
A fostering panel is made up of people who have not been involved in the fostering assessment.
They will include:
Independent Panel Members, which includes people with experience and expertise in foster care, education, health, disability and family placement social work and
Members with social work experience including in in-family placement.
The purpose of the panel is to make recommendations about whether a person should be approved to foster a specific child or any child who is looked after.
People who want to become foster carers are usually invited to attend part of the panel meeting where their assessment is being discussed.
When a social worker completes a full fostering assessment of someone who wants to be a foster carer, they write a report on that person. This report must be presented to a Fostering Panel who can make any of the following recommendations:
To approve the foster carer
To approve the foster carer but with certain conditions (noted during the assessment)
To ask the social worker to return to the panel at a later date with additional information
Not to approve the foster carer.
The final decision about approval rests with a Children’s Services decision maker who will consider the panel’s recommendation.
If a person's application to be a foster carer is refused by Children's Services, they can apply for a review of the decision through the Independent Review Mechanism.

INTERIM CARE ORDER
INTERIM CARE ORDER
An interim care order (ICO) is a temporary order made by the court which says that the child should be looked after in the care system for a temporary period. It means that the court has good reasonsto believe a child has been seriously harmed or is likely to be seriously harmed, and that an Interim Care Order is the best thing for the child until there is a final hearing. It is usually made at the beginning of care proceedings to give Children’s Services temporary powers and it usually lasts until the case is finally decided. It can be ended before that if the court decides that it is no longer justified.
Under this order, Children’s Services share parental responsibility for the child with the parents. This means that they must find out parents wishes about any decision concerning their child, but Children's Services always have the final say and can make plans for the child even if the parents don’t agree with them.

ISSUES RESOLUTION HEARING (IRH)
ISSUES RESOLUTION HEARING (IRH)
This is a court hearing, held after the Case Management Hearing and should take place before the case is finally at 26 weeks. The court decides exactly when. At the IRH the court looks at:
- what is agreed or decided so far;- what still needs to be decided and- whether any more evidence is needed.
The court considers whether a final hearing is needed at all or whether a final decision can be made in a fair way at the IRH.

JUDICIAL REVIEW
JUDICIAL REVIEW
This is a legal procedure in which a court decides whether an action, or a failure to do something which should have been done, by a government body (like a local authority), was lawful.
If, for example, a parent thinks that Children’s Services has not followed some of their legal duties towards their child, they might be able to challenge the decision in court in a Judicial Review, although it is unusual.

KINSHIP CARER
KINSHIP CARER
A kinship carer is a relative or friend who is looking after a child that cannot live with his/her parents. Sometimes they are known as Family and Friends carers. If the social worker was involved in placing the child with the relative or friend, the child is likely to be looked after. If they were not, then it is likely to be a private arrangement.

LEAD PROFESSIONAL
LEAD PROFESSIONAL
Sometimes professionals from several different agencies are involved in a child’s life, for example Children’s Services, Health, Education. Usually in those situations, one person is named as the lead professional.
The lead professional can come from any of the different agencies working with the child, depending on the child’s needs. It’s their job to be the main contact person for the child and their family and to coordinate all the help the family is getting under the Common Assessment Framework.
LEAD SOCIAL WORKER
LEAD SOCIAL WORKER The lead social worker for the child is appointed at a child protection conference when the child is made subject of a multi-agency child protection plan. The lead social worker should be a qualified and experienced social worker and an employee of the lead statutory body which is usually the Local Authority.The lead social worker is responsible for:
developing the outline plan into a full inter-agency plan, which they must then circulate to relevant professionals and family members
co-ordinating inter-agency work and the contribution of family members to make sure that what has been agreed in the plan is implemented
explaining and agreeing the plan with your child as appropriate, and undertaking direct work with your child and family, taking into account your views as long as they are consistent with your child’s welfare
completing and co-ordinating any outstanding aspects of the in-depth assessment
deciding whether they need to inform the relevant Embassy if your child has links to a foreign country. A child is considered to have links if they are a foreign national child, a child with dual nationality or a British child of foreign parents/national origin.

LEAVE OF THE COURT
LEAVE OF THE COURT
This means the ‘permission’ of the court. Sometimes people who are not parents of the child, like family and friends carers, want the court to make an order so the child can live with them or see them. However they cannot apply for the order unless the court gives them permission first to start off the application.

LEGAL AID
LEGAL AID
If you get legal aid it means you get free legal advice or representation by a solicitor.
All parents and other people with parental responsibility automatically get legal aid to cover the costs of having a solicitor in care proceedings and to help them negotiate with Children's Services if they have received a letter before proceedings.
Legal aid is also available in some other situations (for example if a relative wants to apply for an order to care for a child when there has been child abuse) as an alternative to them going into care, but it will be means tested, there are strict criteria to say what counts as child abuse and the person wanting legal aid will also have to prove to the legal aid agency they have a good case.
For more information please see here.
LEGAL PLANNING MEETING
LEGAL PLANNING MEETING When social workers (or the child protection review conference) decide that the parent’s care of their child is not improving enough to protect the child from significant harm, they will call a legal planning meeting. This meeting is for social workers and the local authority’s lawyers to decide whether it is in the child’s best interests:
for the parent(s) to be given a further period of support to improve their parenting, or
to find someone else in the child’s wider family to care for the child, or
for the child to be removed from their parent’s care straight away.
The parents (or others with parental responsilbity) should be sent a letter setting out the decision made at the meeting . This may be a letter before proceedings or a letter of issue.
The parents (or others with parental responsibility) will not be invited to attend a legal planning meeting.
Goto Top
LETTER BEFORE PROCEEDINGS
LETTER BEFORE PROCEEDINGS
This letter should be sent to parents and others with parental responsibility by Children's Services when they have held a legal planning meeting and they think that they are likely to apply to court for a care order to remove the child from home, but have decided to give the parents/others with parental responsibility a last chance to sort out the problems they think are impacting on the child safety and welfare.
The letter before proceedings should explain to the parents/others with parental responsibility that court proceedings are likely but that they are being given a last chance to improve their parenting to avoid their child being removed. It should also:
set out the concerns about the child's safety
set out what they need to change or improve in their parenting to avoid the child being removed from their care
set out what help they will continue to be given to keep the child safe
invite them to a pre-proceedings meeting to discuss the improvements they need to make and
give them information about how they can get free legal advice and representation.
If you receive a letter before proceedings, it is really important that you see a solicitor specialising in children's law immediately. Children's Services should send you details of local specialist solicitors. You should give your solicitor a copy of the letter you have received – this will mean you do not have to pay the costs of them helping you negotiate with Children's Services.

LETTER OF ISSUE
LETTER OF ISSUE
If Children’s Services decide it is in the child’s best interests to remove the child from their parent’s care, the social worker may apply to court for an order saying that the child should be removed against their wishes. In these circumstances, the social worker must send the parents (or others with parental responsibility) a ‘letter of issue’, informing them that legal proceedings are being started and that they should see a solicitor specialising in children’s law immediately.

LOCAL PROTOCOLS FOR ASSESSMENT
Each local authority in discussion with their partner agencies and with the agreement of the LSCB should publish a local protocol for assessment which sets out clear arrangements for how cases will be managed once a child is referred to Children's Services for help or protection. This protocol should explain how the different assessments of different family members (eg an education, health and care plan, or an assessment by Adult services) will inform each other. Details of what each local protocol for assessment should include is in Working Together 2015 page 27.

LOOKED AFTER CHILD
LOOKED AFTER CHILD
This means any child who is being cared for by Children's Services or who is remanded by a youth court. There are three main types of looked after children:-
those who are in care (i.e. they are removed from home under a court order, for example a Care Order or Emergency Protection Order);
those who are accommodated (i.e. they are in the care system with the agreement of their parents/others with parental responsibility (see children in accommodation); and
those who are on remand because they are awaiting trial for a criminal offence
When a child is looked after (and not on remand) they may be placed:
with the other parent/other person with parental responsibility, provided they are suitable, but if there is no sutiable parent then in the most appropriate placement. When deciding which is the most appropriate placement, preference should be given to placing them
with a relative, friend or other connected person who is approved as a foster carer. Otherwise they will be placed
in foster care or a residential unit.
However, if they are on remand, they will be placed in Youth Detention Accommodation (secure training centre, secure children's home or youth offender institution) or in local authority accommodation (for example with a foster carer).

LOOKED AFTER CHILDREN (LAC) REVIEW MEETING
LOOKED AFTER CHILDREN (LAC) REVIEW MEETING
When a child is looked after, their situation is regularly reviewed at LAC reviews meetings. The purpose of these meetings is to:
look at the child’s care plan,
make sure that the right arrangements are in place for the child whilst they are looked after,
discuss any changes since the last review, and
consider whether decisions made at the last review were acted on.
It is the time for parents to raise any issues or concerns, for example about where the child lives, contact, education or health matters.
The first LAC review meeting must be held within four weeks of the child being looked after. The second is held within the next three months and the third and later reviews are held every 6 months. Reviews should also be held in the following circumstances:
when there is going to be a significant change to the care plan,
when a child goes into or leaves custody;
when there is a plan for a looked after child to leave care before the age of 18;
if there is a plan to move a child from a place where they have been settled for some time.
LAC review meetings are chaired by an Independent Reviewing Officer.They are normally attended by:
parents/others with parental responsibility for the child,
the social worker,
the child,
the foster carer and
the foster carer’s supervising social worker
other professionals may be there too, but it shouldn’t be so many that it overwhelms the child.

MANCHESTER JUDGEMENT
This high court judgement made it clear that family and friends carers, caring for a looked after child who was placed with them by Children’s Services, have a right to be paid a fostering allowance at the same approved  rates as unrelated foster carers who work for Children’s Services. They should receive this payment from the date the child is placed with them and should also receive other support to care for the child.Another Judgement called the Tower Hamlets Judgement and Statutory Family and Friends Care Guidance have also confirmed the same point.

MEDIATION
MEDIATION
This is a service which helps people who disagree about aspects of a child's care or arrangements to find solutions to the problem, without having to go to court.
A family mediator is a trained professional who helps family members negotiate. They do this by keeping the discussion focussed on the issues which are not agreed and on the child's needs, rather than those of the adults. The mediator is neutral and therefore does not take sides.
It is the people taking part in the mediation rather than the mediator who make plans for the child. Sometimes this involves the mediator seeing the child to ask their views on particular questions to help inform the adults' discussions.
In many cases, mediation can be very successful in helping find solutions that work for the child and the adults involved, for example in agreeing the arrangements about who the child should see and where they should live. However, agreements reached at mediation are not legally enforceable without further legal steps being taken.
The law has recently changed so that in most cases it is now a requirement that any person wanting to apply to court for a private law order about caring for or seeing children has to meet with a mediator for a Mediation Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM) to find out about whether mediation would be suitable in their case before they can start their case in court. But there are some circumstances where this does not apply, for example where there is evidence of domestic violence or child abuse or the application is urgent.

MEDIATION INFORMATION AND ASSESSMENT MEETING
MEDIATION INFORMATION AND ASSESSMENT MEETING
People who want to apply to court for a Child Arrangements Order first have to meet with a mediator to discuss whether mediation may be a suitable way of resolving their case. This meeting is called a mediation, information and assessment meeting or 'MIAM'. The mediator must sign either the person's application form or a separate form to say whether mediation has or has not gone ahead in that case.
But there are some situations where it is not necessary to attend mediation before making a court application. The main ones are:
Where there is evidence of domestic violence - the applicant must show evidence that they or the child who is the subject of the application have been a victim of domestic violence with the other party being the cause of it;
There are child protection concerns - the applicant must prove to the court that the child who is the subject of the application (or another child living in the same household), is the subject of a child protection investigation being carried out by Children's Services or is the subject of a child protection plan.
The application is urgent – the applicant must be able to show that the delay caused in attending a MIAM would cause
- a risk of harm to a child; or
- a risk of unlawful removal of a child from the United Kingdom, or
- a risk of unlawful retention of a child who is currently outside England and Wales;
Previous attendance at a MIAM – i.e. that the applicant has attended a MIAM about the same child in the last 4 months.

MULTI-AGENCY RISK ASSESSMENT CONFERENCE (MARAC)
A multi-agency risk assessment conference (MARAC) is a meeting for professionals only. It involves a number of agencies, such as the Police, Housing, Children's Services and Health and is held regularly in the local area.
The purpose of a MARAC is to share information about high risk domestic abuse victims – those at risk of murder or serious harm - so that a risk focused and co-ordinated safety plan is made to support adult and child victims. The professionals present at the meeting will agree the actions that will be taken, and by whom, to reduce the risk of future violence. Everything that is discussed in the meeting is confidential and will only be shared with other agencies in exceptional circumstances.
Whenever possible, if your situation is discussed at a MARAC, your views can be represented at the conference by your Independent Domestic Violence Advisor (IDVA).

PARALLEL PLANNING (ALSO KNOWN AS TWIN-TRACK OR CONTINGENCY PLANNING)
PARALLEL PLANNING (ALSO KNOWN AS TWIN-TRACK OR CONTINGENCY PLANNING)
This describes how several plans may be made at the same time during the early stages of a child becoming looked after. It means that a number of different possible long-term placements are being considered at once. For example, to see whether it’s possible for the child to return home to their parents, but at the same time having a back-up plan for the child to live elsewhere, like with a family member or foster carer if that is not possible. That way if the child can’t return home, time isn’t wasted starting assessments of new carers all over again.
This process can also include considering long-term foster placements or even adoption, should the other plans be unsuccessful. Children’s Services would need to have a care order or placement order to go ahead with these. However if they are considering adoption, they could place a child with foster carers who are also approved as prospective adopters - see fostering for adoption.

PARENT CARER'S NEEDS ASSESSMENT
PARENT CARER'S NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The law changed recently so that adults with parental responsibility for a disabled child have a right to a separate parent carer’s needs assessment. An assessment must be done if a social worker thinks that the parent appears to need support, or if it is requested by the parent.The local authority must assess whether that parent has needs for support and, if so, what those needs are. This will include an assessment of whether it is appropriate for the parent to provide, or continue to provide, care for the disabled child, in the light of their own needs for support.The assessment must also have regard to:
the well-being of the parent carer; and
the need to safeguard / promote the welfare of the disabled child and any other child for whom the parent carer has parental responsibility.
Following assessment, the local authority must then decide whether the parent has needs for support; whether the disabled child for has needs for support; and if so whether those needs could be met (wholly or partly) by services that may be provided for children in need, under Children Act 1989, s17.Adults who do not have parental responsibility, but are caring for a disabled child, are also entitled (under different legislation) to an assessment on their ability to provide, or to continue to provide, care for that disabled child.See here for further information about adult carers assessments.
PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY (PR)
PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY (PR)
Parental responsibility is defined in law as “all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority, which by law a parent has in relation to the child and the administration of his/her property.”
In practical terms, it means the responsibility to care for a child and the right to make important decisions about the child, for example agreeing to medical/dental treatment. .
Any person caring for a child, for example a family and friends carer can make all the day to day decisions about the child to make sure they are well looked after, but  they should speak to someone who has parental responsibility when it comes to important decisions about the child.
The following people have parental responsibility for a child:
All birth mothers
Married fathers
Unmarried fathers with a parental responsibility agreement (forms are available from local courts) or a parental responsibility order from the court
Unmarried fathers named on the child's birth certificate (after 1 December 2003)
Female partner’s of mother’s who have a child by assisted reproduction, (so long as they both formally consented to her being a parent with the licensed treatment provider), and they either:
Are in a civil partnership;
or don’t enter a civil partnership, but the partner is named on the birth certificate, or obtains it by parental responsibility agreement with the mother or by a court order.
Step-parents (including civil partners) if they have made an authorised agreement with both parents with parental responsibility or
Anyone who has a Residence Order or a Child Arrangements Order (saying the child should live with them).
Anyone who has been appointed as guardian of the child by a parent with parental responsibility who has died (and there is no surviving parent with parental responsibility)
Anyone who has a Special Guardianship order for the child
The local authority if they have a Care Order or Emergency Protection Order for the child
Adoptive parents
Prospective adopters when the child is placed with them
You cannot give parental responsibility to anyone else, although you can arrange for other people to meet your parental responsibilities, for example, if your child is being looked after by relatives or while your child is at school.
Also, if you want to take a child abroad you need the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility.
An unmarried father who does not have parental responsibility will still be a "parent" under the Children Act. He is therefore entitled to be involved in decisions made about his child by the local authority and the courts. However, he will not be considered as a ‘parent’ when it comes to making decisions about adoption of his child, so if you are a father in this situation it is essential that you see a solicitor specialising in child care lawas soon as possible.

PARTIES TO PROCEEDINGS
PARTIES TO PROCEEDINGS
‘Parties’ are the people who are involved in legal cases before the courts. So in children’s cases the parties could be:
Children’s Services the child represented by their Guardian and the parents; or
if the disagreement is just between the two parents, for example over where the child lives, the parties would be the mother and the father.
Other people can join a court case as a party too, for example grandparents who wish to care for their grandchild. This means they could join in the case, but they would need to ask the courts permission to be allowed to do this.
Parties are allowed in the court room and are allowed copies of all the paperwork, such as reports and other documents. Information will only be kept away from a party if telling them something could put another person at risk and the court gives specific permission.

A placement with unrelated foster carers in foster care; or
Adoption when a child is legally adopted into another family. This can only happen if clear procedures are followed and the court makes an adoption order.
A permanence plan should be developed at the second looked after child review.

POLICE PROTECTION
POLICE PROTECTION
The police may remove a child to a safe place for up to 72 hours if they are called to a home and are worried about a child’s immediate safety, for example if a young child has been left alone.
Sometimes social workers ask the police to use these powers if they are worried that a child is in immediate danger and they do not have time to apply to court for an emergency protection order (EPO) to keep the child safe.
However, it is recommended that social workers should try to apply for an EPO rather than asking the police to use these powers.
If a child is removed by the police, they will ask Children’s Services to look after the child during that time. If social workers don’t think it is safe for the child to return home after 72 hours, they can only continue to keep the child away from home if the court makes an EPO or the parents or others with parental responsibility agree to their child being accommodated.For more information see: advice sheets 9: Child protection procedures and 15: Care proceedings.

PRE-PROCEEDINGS MEETING
PRE-PROCEEDINGS MEETING
If Children's Services send you a letter before proceedings they should invite you to attend a pre-proceedings meeting. This meeting is a last opportunity for you to discuss with Children's Services what they still want you to do to be able to care safely for your child to avoid your child being removed from your care. You will normally be given a further 6 weeks after the meeting to make necessary changes to keep your child safe. If you don't make these changes within the time period they tell you, Children's Services will normally apply to court for an order to remove your child.
It is very important that you attend this meeting and that you ask a solicitor specialising in children's law to go to the meeting with you and to prepare what you want to say beforehand. You should also discuss with your wider family how they can help you keep your child safe, before you go to the pre-proceedings meeting. You can then tell the social worker at the meeting how your family can help . You can also ask the social worker to arrange a family group conference so that your family can come together to make a safe plan, including identifying who could care for your child, if you cannot.
You should also let the social worker know that you will come to the meeting.

PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT
PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT
Sometimes when there is a problem in the parents’ home, a grandparent or other relative agrees to care for the child. If this is done by agreement with the parents, and not at the direction of a social worker, this is a “private arrangement” sometimes also known as a “family arrangement”. In that situation, Children’s Services have not taken on any legal or financial responsibility for the arrangement.
However, this is often an area in dispute. Sometimes social workers are very involved in making plans for a child to live with relatives as they think it is not safe for the child to stay with their parents, but they then say it is a private arrangement and that they do not have to give the carer any financial or other help. If this happens to you, you should take advice from a solicitor or Family Rights Group about what you can do to challenge this.

A private foster carer is someone who is not a relative or a foster carer working for Children’s Services who is (or plans to be) caring for a child under the age of 16 (or under 18 if disabled) for more than 28 days and the arrangement was made privately, not through social workers.
A relative in this context is a step parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle or older sibling whether full or half blood, marriage or civil partnership.
When a child is privately fostered, the parent and the private foster carer must tell Children’s Services about the arrangement as soon as possible. Once they have been notified, a social worker will visit private foster carer’s home where the child is staying within 7 days. They will speak to the carer and the child and make sure the child is safe and well cared for. The social worker must carry on visiting the child at regular intervals for as long as the child is privately fostered.

PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT (ADULT)
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT (ADULT)
A psychologist is a professional with expert knowledge of the human mind, feelings and behaviour.
Sometimes, when you and your child are involved with Children’s Services, you may be asked to have a psychological assessment. This may be recommended as part of a child protection plan or it may be ordered in court proceedings.
You should always be asked if you agree to an assessment. But, it is important to be aware that if it has been ordered by a court, you will normally be expected to cooperate with the assessment and if you don’t, the court will want to know why. This is something you can discuss with your solicitor if you have one.
When the psychologist sees you, they may ask you about things like:
how you are now and what has happened to you in the past, including when you were a child;
whether you are able to change things that affect the way you care for your child;
whether, with the right support or treatment, you could look after your child better; and
whether you would be able to make changes to the way you care for your child within a timescale which is suitable for your child’s development.
After the psychologist has seen you, they will normally prepare a report about you for the child protection conference or the court. You should be able to see the report and be given time to think about (and respond to) any recommendations the psychologist makes in the report.

PUBLIC LAW OUTLINE (PLO)
PUBLIC LAW OUTLINE (PLO)
This is the system which guides the courts on how to manage care proceedings.
Related guidance elsewhere says that social workers must work with the family to try to find solutions to the problems before proceedings start (unless there is an emergency).
The PLO says that the court must check that this family work has been done at the first hearing. It must also check to see if there are any family or friends carers who could care for the child (if the child is unlikely to stay with their parents). The PLO also says how the court should manage the case and the timescales which should be followed up to the final hearing.A new PLO is in force from April 2014. It is called Practice Direction 12A. Under this new guidance for courts:
care proceedings should normally take no longer than 26 weeks; and parents and family members must formally apply for any further assessment of their ability to care for the child and any expert evidence they need to support that by the case management hearing at the latest (see above) or they are in danger of being refused.

REGULATION 24 PLACEMENT
REGULATION 24 PLACEMENT
This is a law which allows Children’s Services to place a child with a family member or friend in an emergency situation for up to 16 weeks (without doing a full fostering assessment) provided they have carried out certain basic checks about that person’s home circumstances and their ability to care for and protect the child. This should allow Children’s Services to be satisfied that the placement will keep the child safe and well.

REMAND
REMAND
When a young person is charged with a criminal offence and is awaiting trial, they can either be given bail by the court, or they can be held on remand.For a child (aged 10-17) remand means that the court orders them to stay in Youth Detention Accommodation (a young offenders institution, secure children's home or secure training centre) or in local authority accommodation until their trial date.All young people held on remand are looked after children.

RESIDENCE ORDER
RESIDENCE ORDER
A Residence Order is a legal order which says who a child should live with and gives that person parental responsibility for the child. It does not take away parental responsibility from the child's parents. A residence order can last until the age of 18, or can be ended earlier by the court. The law has changed so that courts cannot make residence orders any more. They are now replaced by Child Arrangements Orders. But if you already have a residence order for a child, it is still valid and will continue unless the court makes a new order.
For more information please see: advice sheet 18: DIY Child Arrangements Orders: information for family and friends carers.

RESIDENCE ORDER ALLOWANCE
RESIDENCE ORDER ALLOWANCE
Children’s Services may give financial help to someone with a Residence Order (who is not a parent, or married to one) by paying them a Residence Order Allowance, but they don't have to and it is means tested. The rates of Residence Order Allowances should be no less than the core child allowance under the same local authority's Fostering Scheme.
However, now that residence orders have been replaced by Child Arrangements Order (saying who the child should live with), Children's Services can now pay a Child Arrangements Order allowance instead of a Residence Order Allowance. The basis on which it is paid will be the same as for Residence orders.

REVIEW CHILD PROTECTION CONFERENCE
REVIEW CHILD PROTECTION CONFERENCE
The purpose of the child protection review conference is to look at whether or not there are still serious concerns about the safety of the child and how well the parents can care for and protect him or her. In other words this meeting decides whether the child is still suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm.
The review conference can agree that the child doesn’t need a child protection plan any longer. Or, the conference might decide that the child protection plan needs changing, or that the child should stay on the same child protection plan.
The first child protection review conference is held three months after the initial Child Protection Conference. After that, review conferences are held every six months.
Usually these meetings will be chaired by the same person who chaired the initial child protection conference. The same professionals will also be invited to attend.

SECURE ACCOMMODATION
SECURE ACCOMMODATION
Children’s Services can place a child over 13 in secure accommodation if he/she:
has a history of running away, or is likely to, and is likely to suffer significant harm; OR
if secure accommodation isn’t used, he/she is likely to injure him/her self or others.
The initial placement can only be for up to 72 hours. To remain there any longer Children’s Services must make an application to court. The young person has the right to be legally represented at this hearing.

SEND SUPPORT
SEND SUPPORT Under the new system for managing SEND, schools must use a four-part process to support a child with SEND. The new SEND Code of Practice explains this as "Assess, Plan, Do and Review". This means that the SENCO and teachers should first assess the child to see what help she/he needs, make a plan for how that support will help them, including what progress they expect to see, do put this support in place, and then regularly review the situation to see if the plan is working, or whether different help is needed.
They school should arrange meetings with the parent or carer at least three times a year to see how the plan is progressing The school must provide a report at least once a year on the child's progress. Every school should publish on their website their SEND information report, which sets out their policy for managing pupils with SEND.

SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE
SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE A settlement conference is a hearing, before a judge, held for the purpose of discussion and settlement of a public law case, most likely proceedings for a care or placement order. The purpose is to try to resolve some or all the issues by agreement. It can only take place with the consent of all the parties, and usually takes place after the IRH (issues resolution hearing). What is said and discussed during the settlement conference will not be admissible in evidence except in very exceptional circumstances.
The judge hearing the settlement conference must have no further involvement with the case after the end of the settlement conference, other than to make a final order by agreement or, if there is no agreement, make further directions for a final hearing. Parties attend with their legal representatives (if they have them) but are encouraged to speak directly with the judge. At the end of the settlement conference if there is agreement on all matters, the case will end and an order drafted reflecting the decisions made; the parties will not have to attend a final hearing.

SEXUAL ABUSE
SEXUAL ABUSE
Sexual abuse can mean many different things. Broadly speaking, it means getting a child involved in sexual activities, whether or not violence is used and whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. The sexual activity does not need to be physical. It could involve for example watching sexual images, encouraging a child to behave in a sexual way or grooming a child for future sexual abuse.For more information see: advice sheet 9: Child protection procedures.

SHORT BREAKS
SHORT BREAKS
A child is looked after on a short break arrangement when:
the child has a series of placements,
no single placement lasts more than 17 days and
the total time they are looked after in any 12 month period is 75 days.
Care plans should still be drawn up for them but they are reviewed less frequently than plans for other looked after children who are not on short breaks.

SIGNIFICANT HARM
SIGNIFICANT HARM
The Children Act 1989 introduced the phrase "significant harm" to describe the amount of harm that a child must be suffering before Children’s Services become involved in family life against the family's wishes. For example, Children’s Services must:
carry out child protection enquiries if they suspect a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm, and
take steps to protect a child whom they have reasonable cause to believe is suffering, likely to suffer, or has suffered significant harm - either in agreement with the family or through the court.
"Harm " means "ill-treatment or the impairment of health or development". It includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, damage to mental or emotional well-being (emotional abuse), and neglect. It can include a child seeing or hearing another person being ill-treated.
There is no definition of "significant" but the law requires local authorities and the courts to compare your child's health and development with a similar child to establish whether the harm is significant.

SOCIAL WORKER
SOCIAL WORKER
A social worker (sometimes called a key worker) is a qualified and registered professional. A children’s social worker’s job is to make sure children are safe and well cared for. Most are employed by Children’s Services but some are employed by other agencies or may be self-employed independent social workers.

SOCIAL WORK COURT TEMPLATE
SOCIAL WORK COURT TEMPLATE
The template can be used by Children's Services to make an application to court for a supervision order or a care order. It sets out the common concerns for all children in the family as well as setting out the distinct needs of each child. The template may also include the social work chronology or this may be set out separately. It is a legal document and its main purpose is to present Children's Services' evidence clearly and analytically to assist the court in making decisions for the child.
The template is expected to be used by all local authorities by summer 2015.
When using the template the social worker must apply the welfare checklist and must provide an analysis of harm, of the impact on each child of what has been happening to them including any factors which lessen the risk of harm. The social worker should explain their analysis of the parents' parenting capability and wider family and friends' caring ability. The social worker must also evaluate all realistic placement options, listing all the advantages and disadvantages of each option, with clear reasons for the social worker's proposed long-term plan for the child

SOLICITOR
SOLICITORA solicitor (sometimes called a lawyer) is a qualified professional who is regulated by the professional body called the Law Society.
In some circumstances (for example for parents in care proceedings) are paid for by legal aid.
If Children’s Services go to court to seek a legal order for your child it is a good idea to choose a solicitor who is knowledgeable and experienced in this area and who is a member of the Law Society's Accreditation Scheme.

SOUTHWARK RULING
SOUTHWARK RULING
In this case (Southwark LBC –v- D [2007]) the Court of Appeal said that if Children’s Services are involved in placing a child with a family or friends carer, then, unless they specifically agree something different with the carer at the time of the placement, the child will usually be treated as a being looked after child. This means that the carer must be assessed, approved, paid and supported in the same way as any unrelated foster carers who work for Children’s Services. Other later cases have confirmed the same point.
See: advice sheets 12: Immediate placement of looked after children with relatives or friends and 21: Support for relatives and friends who are caring for children.
SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS COORDINATOR (SENCO)
SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS COORDINATOR (SENCO)
Each school will have its own Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO). This is a member of staff who is responsible for the school's SEND policy, and works to ensure that the school meets the needs of its pupils with SEND. Along with the class teacher, the SENCO is likely to be the main contact within the school for discussing the special educational needs of a child, and the school's provision for meeting them.
Goto Top
SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND/OR DISABILITY (SEND)
SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND/OR DISABILITY (SEND) Children and young people with SEND all have learning difficulties or disabilities that make it harder for them to learn than most children and young people of the same age. These children and young people may need extra or different help from that given to others.
Many children and young people will have SEN of some kind at some time during their education. Early years providers (for example, nurseries or childminders), mainstream schools, colleges and other organisations can help most children and young people succeed with some changes to their practice or additional support. But some children and young people will need extra help for some or all of their time in education and training. SEND fall into four broad areas of need:
communication and interaction;
cognition and learning;
social, emotional and mental health difficulties; and
sensory and/or physical impairments.
Where a school identifies that a pupil is making less than expected progress given their age and individual circumstances, their first response should be to target high quality teaching at the pupil's area of weakness through a process of differentiation ('differentiation' is a process where a child can be taught differently from classmates in order to achieve the same progress that is expected of them). After this, if progress continues to be less than expected, the class or subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should assess whether the child has SEND.Goto Top
SPECIAL GUARDIAN
SPECIAL GUARDIAN
A special guardian is someone who has a Special Guardianship Order for a child. This order may be made by the court when a child is living permanently with someone other than their parents (such as relatives or long term foster carers).
A Special Guardian has parental responsibility for the child. They don’t have to consult the parents or anyone else with parental responsibility about most decisions for the child. But there are some things they cannot do or decide without the permission of the parents/others with parental responsibility or the court, such as
they cannot change a child’s surname
they cannot take the child abroad for more than 3 months and
they cannot agree to the child being placed for adoption.
For more information see: advice sheet 19: DIY Special Guardianship – information for family and friends carers.

SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP ALLOWANCE
SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP ALLOWANCE
When someone is granted a Special Guardianship Order, Children’s Services can give that person financial help by paying them a Special Guardianship Allowance, but they don’t have to. Any payments they agree to make will be means tested and are usually reviewed on a regular basis.
If a Special Guardian was previously a foster carer and received a fostering allowance for the child, they may get a higher rate of special guardianship allowance for the first two years.
From November 2016, when the new, lower benefits cap takes effect, Special Guardians Allowance will be exempt from the cap. This means that the money you receive from a Special Guardians Allowance will not count towards your total benefits when calculating how much benefit you get, for the purposes of the benefits cap.

SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP ORDER (SGO)
SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP ORDER (SGO)
A Special Guardianship Order is a legal order which says that a child will live with someone who is not their parent on a long-term basis. In theory, the order can be ended before the child is 18 but this would be unusual. Parents cannot apply to end the order without the permission of the court and they would only get this permission if they could show that there had been a significant change of circumstances since the original order was made.
A Special Guardianship Order also gives the special guardian parental responsibility for the child. They don’t have to consult the parents or anyone else with parental responsibility about most decisions for the child. But there are some things they cannot do or decide without the permission of the parents/others with parental responsibility or the court, such as
they cannot change a child’s surname
they cannot take the child abroad for more than 3 months and
they cannot agree to the child being placed for adoption.
This order does not remove parental responsibility from the child's birth parents, but they are very few decisions that they can make whilst the special guardianship order exists.
Unlike in adoption cases, the child remains legally a member of the birth family under a special guardianship order.

STRATEGY DISCUSSION
STRATEGY DISCUSSION
This is a discussion which takes place between Children’s Services, the police and possibly other child care agencies at the beginning of child protection enquiries.The purpose of the discussion is to decide:
whether and how the child protection enquiries should be carried out; and
whether any immediate steps need to be taken to keep the child safe while the child protection investigation is underway, for example, if someone should be asked not to have contact with the child for the time being.
Parents are not normally invited to strategy meetings but should be informed as soon as possible afterwards of what is likely to happen.

SUPERVISED CONTACT
SUPERVISED CONTACT
Sometimes a court or a social worker thinks it is best for a child if someone else is present when a child’s has contact with someone (perhaps a parent they don’t live with). This is to make sure the person having contact doesn’t do anything that might harm or upset the child.
If the court or the social worker says contact should be supervised, then the child and parents may be told where to meet, for example in a contact centre, and how long they can spend with their child, being supervised by staff etc.
When professionals supervise contact, they often make written observations of the contact and these may be used as evidence in court.
Goto Top
SUPERVISION ORDER
SUPERVISION ORDER
A court can ask Children’s Services to “supervise” how the parent cares for their child under a supervision order. A social worker will agree a contract or supervision plan with the parent, which will set out what is expected of the parent and the help the social worker will give.
This order does not give Children’s Services parental responsibility for the child so basic decisions about how the child is raised can be made by the parents/other with parental responsibility but they may still want to discuss things with the supervising social worker to make sure they are happy with the plan.
A Supervision Order lasts for up to one year, and can be extended at most for two more years.

TEMPORARY FOSTER CARER
TEMPORARY FOSTER CARER A temporary foster carer is someone who has been requested to take on the care of a child in an emergency, and has not yet been fully approved as a foster carer. Before the child is first placed with the temporary foster carer the social worker will have to find out certain information about the carer and their household, or if time does not allow, find out that information as soon as possible after the child has been placed with them. The information the social worker will need includes asking about any criminal records of the carer or any of the adults in the household and doing police checks. Once the social worker has gathered information about the carer and decided that she/he is a suitable person to care temporarily for the child, the carer will be approved to foster the child for up to 16 weeks. This can be extended once only for an extra 8 weeks. During that time, Children’s Services should assess the carer to be a fully approved foster carer, if the carers wants to go on fostering the child after the 24 weeks is up. If they are not fully approved as foster carer by the end of the 16 weeks (or in some cases 24 weeks) the child is likely be removed from their care.
THRESHOLD CRITERIA
THRESHOLD CRITERIA
A court can only make certain orders about a child, like care, supervision or adoption orders, if it is satisfied that, when Children’s Servicesfirst got involved in protecting the child, s/he was suffering or was likely to suffer significant harm, and that the harm was due to the parents’ care not being what is normally expected of a parent.
Once the court decides this is true, it goes on to decide if it’s best for the child to make an order.

WELFARE CHECKLIST
WELFARE CHECKLIST
When a court makes a decision about a child, for example, about where the child should live or with whom the child should have contact, it must consider the “welfare checklist”. This is a list of things about the child which help the court to focus on the best interests of the child. It means the court must think about:
the child’s wishes and feelings
the child’s physical, emotional and/or education needs
the child’s age, sex and background
the likely effect of the proposed change on the child
the risk of harm to the child
how capable the child’s parent is of meeting his or her needs.
This checklist also includes a presumption that, unless the contrary is shown, each parent being involved in the life of the child will further the child's welfare, although each case will turn on its own facts.
There is a slightly different checklist that applies in adoption cases.

YOUNG CARER
YOUNG CARER
A young carer is a person under the age of 18 who has significant caring responsibilities for another person. They might look after, for example, a younger sibling or a family member with a disability.
A young person should not have to take too much responsibility for caring for others without help. They should be entitled to help and support for example:
if they are considered to be a child in need they can get help from Children’s Services;
they may be able to get help from a local support group for young carers; and/or
if they are caring for a disabled parent then a “whole family” assessment should be completed by Adult and Children’s Services working together so as to work out the package to help the whole family.
For more information see: advice sheets 4: Family Support Services and advice sheet 6: Support for disabled parents in a parenting role (being updated).

YOUNG CARER'S ASSESSMENT
YOUNG CARER'S ASSESSMENT The local authority have a duty to assess the needs of a young carer when:
they identify a young person who appears to need support due to their caring responsibilities, or
the young carer or their parent asks the local authority to assess their need for support.
The purpose of the assessment is to find out how much, and what kind of, care is being provided by the young carer, as well as what care might be provided in the future. It must also consider how much the family are relying on the young person to look after the person cared for and whether being a carer is affecting the young person’s well-being, education or development.
The local authority should use a ‘whole family’ approach for the assessment. This means the assessment must consider whether any of the young carer’s needs for support could be prevented or reduced by providing services to someone else – either the person being cared for or another member of the young carer’s family. But, they must also consider whether the young person will still need support even if they are no longer a carer, or if their caring duties are reduced.
At the end of the assessment, the local authority must decide whether the young carer is a child in need, and what support they, or other members of the family need, taking into account the local eligibility criteria.
