As the COVID-19 situation evolves, organizations still have many questions about the impact on their business. Our lawyers are continuing to monitor COVID-19 developments and sharing insights relating to legal and business considerations across a wide range of sectors to help you navigate concerns, manage legal obligations, and address potential risks to your business. We also recognize that organizations have questions about transitioning back to the office from a remote work environment. The Employer’s COVID-19 Return to the Workplace Playbook outlines key considerations for employers when determining when and how to reopen their physical workspaces. For more information, visit Returning to work – what happens next?.
