Remick v. Utah (2016)
21 June 2016
Published in
Resolved Cases
Criminal Justice; Indigent Defense; Equal Protection - UPDATE: On Friday March 23, 2018 the federal district court dismissed the Remick v. Utah lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Utah and the law firm of Holland & Hart in June 2016. The ACLU of Utah is disappointed by the court’s decision, given that the same systemic problems in indigent defense described in the lawsuit continue to play themselves out every day for low-income people charged with crimes in Utah. The ACLU of Utah, together with co-counsel Holland & Hart, will continue efforts to ensure that everyone in Utah—no matter their income level—has access to effective legal counsel.

Winston v. Salt Lake City Police Department (2016)
16 March 2016
Published in
Resolved Cases
Racial Justice, Police Practices, Student Rights, Free Expression, Equal Protection - In 2012, the ACLU of Utah and the ACLU Racial Justice Project brought a federal lawsuit on behalf of three West High School students against school and police defendants over a “gang operation” conducted at school during school hours.  During the December 2010 “gang operation,” over a dozen police officers from a joint agency gang task force entered West during school hours, detained dozens of students, interrogated them about alleged gang membership or affiliation, and recorded that information in a police database.  Police photographed many of those students holding “mug-shot” style signs identifying the students’ alleged gang membership or affiliation and purported gang monikers.  The database documentation and photographs opened these young people to ongoing police scrutiny and other negative consequences, even though they did not commit a crime.  All of the students policed detained, interrogated and documented were of Latino, African-American or Pacific Island descent.  On March 17, 2016, The Salt Lake City Police Department and the Salt Lake City School District reached a settlement agreement by committing to make broad and meaningful changes in how they treat students of color and engage in school disciplinary issues. On March 26, 2019, three…

Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission v. San Juan County et al (2018)
25 February 2016
Published in
Resolved Cases
Participatory Democracy, Equal Protection, Racial Justice - On February 25, 2016, The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (Lawyers’ Committee), DLA Piper, LLP, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah (ACLU of Utah) filed a lawsuit against San Juan County, Utah. The lawsuit, on behalf of the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission, and seven members of the Navajo Nation, challenges the County’s decision to switch to a mail-only voting system, and designating the only location for in-person voting, that adversely impacts Navajo voters. On September 9, 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Jill Parrish issued a decision allowing the lawsuit to proceed to a trial on the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims that San Juan County is not providing effective language assistance to Navajo-speaking voters and is providing unequal voting opportunities to Navajo voters.

Utah Animal Rights Coalition v. Farmington City (2015)
08 September 2015
Published in
Resolved Cases
Free Expression - On September 9, 2015, the ACLU of Utah and the Utah Civil Rights & Liberties Foundation filed a complaint on behalf of the Utah Animal Rights Coalition, Jeremy Beckham, and Alexis Levitt challenging Farmington City’s “Free Speech” Ordinance. The suit alleged that on its face, the Ordinance violated the Utah and United States Constitutions because it required a permit for almost any conceivable form of public expression and imposed criminal penalties for failing to comply. As long-time animal rights activists, Mr. Beckham and Ms. Levitt participated in peaceful protests on the sidewalk and on a public right of way to protest the conditions of the animals at Lagoon. After the protests, they were charged with misdemeanor offenses of the Ordinance because they had not obtained a permit for those free speech and assembly activities. As soon as the lawsuit was filed, the U.S District Court issued an unopposed order immediately halting enforcement of the Ordinance. Soon after, Farmington repealed the Ordinance and the criminal charges against Mr. Beckham and Ms. Levitt were dropped. A settlement was reached with Farmington City.

Roe v. Patton (2015)
12 April 2015
Published in
Resolved Cases
LGBTQ Equality, Equal Protection -  The ACLU of Utah and the national ACLU LGBT Project filed a lawsuit to force the State Office of Vital Records and Statistics to recognize a married same-sex couple as legal parents of their child. The lawsuit was filed in Utah federal court on April 13, 2015, on behalf of Angie and Kami Roe, who sought to both be recognized as parents to their daughter, Lucy. Under Utah’s assisted reproduction statute, the husband of a woman who conceives with donated sperm is automatically recognized as the child’s parent. But because Angie is Kami’s wife instead of her husband, the State Office of Vital Records and Statistics refused to recognize Angie as Lucy’s parent. On Wednesday, July 15, 2015, U.S. District Judge Dee Benson ruled that the State Office of Vital Records and Statistics must recognize a same-sex married couple as legal parents of their child. The ruling holds that the state must apply Utah’s assisted reproduction parentage statute equally to same and different-sex spouses. The Utah Attorney Generals office has said that the ruling will not be appealed.

Ogden Trece Post-Conviction Remedies Act Cases (2014)
27 October 2014
Published in
Resolved Cases
Racial Justice, Criminal Justice - The ACLU of Utah, along with cooperating attorney Randall Richards of Richards & Brown, P.C., filed a class action petition under Utah’s Post Conviction Remedies Act, requesting that the state court vacate all convictions of individuals charged with violating the so-called Ogden gang injunction in light of the Utah Supreme Court’s 2013 decision dissolving that injunction. A separate petition on behalf of an individual petitioner twice convicted of violating the injunction has also been filed. On February 28, 2018, the plaintiffs and Ogden City reached a compromised settlement of claims raised by Plaintiffs against Ogden City in this case. As part of that settlement, Plaintiffs and Ogden City have agreed to terms that mutually resolve disputes about the application of the prior gang injunction in a manner favorable to both Plaintiffs and Ogden City. This settlement resolves all issues between Plaintiffs and Ogden City in the matter, including all appeals. The case remains pending against the Weber County defendants.

Evans v. Utah (2014)
20 October 2014
Published in
Resolved Cases
LGBT Equality, Equal Protection - The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Utah, and Strindberg & Scholnick, LLC filed a lawsuit in Utah state court on behalf of four same-sex couples who were legally married in Utah after a federal court struck down a state ban, but before the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted marriages from taking place while the state challenged the decision. Although the marriages were valid, the state announced that it had placed recognition of their marriages on hold indefinitely. The lawsuit argues that once same-sex couples are legally married in Utah, they gain protections that cannot retroactively be taken away under the due process clauses of the Utah and United States Constitution.

Kitchen v. Herbert (2014)
16 October 2014
Published in
Resolved Cases
LGBTQ Equality, Equal Protection - On October 17, 2013, The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Utah submitted a “friend of the court” brief in support of a case challenging Utah’s ban on marriage for same-sex couples, Kitchen v. Herbert. The ACLU brief called for a heightened level of scrutiny to be placed on any law that discriminates against same-sex couples and their families. On December 20, 2013, a federal court declared that Utah’s ban on marriage for same-sex couples is unconstitutional. On June 25, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld the lower court’s decision. On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review of the case, which means the federal court's decision stands.

Uroza v. Salt Lake County (2014)

Published in
Resolved Cases
Immigrants' Rights, Racial Justice, Criminal Justice, Prison/Jail - On August 5, 2011, the ACLU of Utah with cooperating attorney B. Kent Morgan of The Dyer Law Group filed a complaint in federal district court on behalf of 22-year-old college student Enrique Uroza. The complaint was filed in response to an incident in which Mr. Uroza was held at the Salt Lake County Metro Jail (Metro) for 39 days after his family posted the court-ordered bail. Mr. Uroza was held pursuant to an unconstitutional jail policy, which purportedly gives the jail authority to hold individuals who cannot prove to the satisfaction of jail officials that they are lawfully present in the United States.

Utah Coalition of La Raza v. Herbert (2014)
02 June 2014
Published in
Resolved Cases
Immigrants' Rights, Racial Justice - On May 3, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Utah, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), and the law firm of Munger, Tolles, & Olsen filed a class action lawsuit in federal district court challenging Utah’s HB 497. HB 497 gives law enforcement the authority to demand “papers” demonstrating citizenship or immigration status during traffic stops, much like Arizona’s SB 1070. The lawsuit charged that HB 497 is unconstitutional in that it violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, Fourth Amendment, Equal Protection Clause, and the right to travel. The federal district court promptly blocked implementation of the law. In an Order issued Tuesday, February 21, 2012, Judge Clark Waddoups announced that he will wait to issue a decision on our request for a Preliminary Injunction (“PI”) in UCLR v. Herbert (“UCLR”), Utah’s HB 497 “Show Me Your Papers” lawsuit, until the Supreme Court issues its decision in an Arizona case that raises similar legal questions to some of the issues raised here in Utah. On June 18, 2014, the court issued a decision blocking several key provisions of the law that would have allowed police to arrest certain potentially deportable immigrants and that would have…

Weber Co v. Ogden Trece (2013)
17 October 2013
Published in
Resolved Cases
Racial Justice, Free Expression, Police Practices - On September 12, 2012, The ACLU of Utah, together with cooperating attorneys David Reymann of Parr Brown Gee & Loveless and Randy Richards of Allen, Richards & Pace, filed a Notice of Appeal in the Second Judicial District Court for Weber County appealing the court’s so-called “gang injunction” to the Utah Supreme Court. The injunction purportedly applies to the “Ogden Trece” gang as an entity, and covers virtually the entire city of Ogden. The injunction prohibits more than three hundred of its “alleged” members from a wide range of constitutionally protected conduct, including: associating with other alleged members (including family, friends, and co-workers), engaging in peaceful protests in public places, traveling together to vote, and even appearing in court together to challenge the injunction. The injunction also imposes a perpetual 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on hundreds of individuals that apparently applies for the rest of their lives, as well as permanently prohibiting them from possessing legal firearms, drinking or merely being in the presence of alcohol (on both public and private property), and engaging in any conduct that police, in their unfettered discretion, consider “annoying.” These prohibitions apply to anyone that the police…

The case involves an incident in August 2011 in which corrections officers released a tear gas canister in the Olympus wing of the Utah State Prison to subdue a single prisoner. The tear gas entered the air ventilation system and seeped into cells that have no windows or bars, affecting about 150 inmates.

The Olympus wing is the mental health wing of the prison; it also houses prisoners with severe medical conditions.

Main Street Church v Brigham City (2013)
23 January 2013
Published in
Resolved Cases
On September 11, 2012, The ACLU of Utah filed a complaint on behalf of the Main Street Church of Brigham City challenging Brigham City’s “Free Speech Zone Ordinance.” The suit alleges that on its face, the ordinance violates the Utah and United States Constitutions because it requires a permit for almost any conceivable form of public expression and imposes civil and criminal penalties for failing to comply. On September 13, Brigham City has agreed not to enforce their “Free Speech Zone Ordinance” that was challenged in Federal Court days ago by the ACLU of Utah. Although, this agreement does not suspend the lawsuit filed against Brigham City. Main Street Church and the ACLU of Utah have not conceded that any past enforcement of the ordinance was constitutional. They also continue to contend that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face and that it should be completely struck down by the court. On January 24, 2013, Brigham City and Main Street Church of Brigham City settled the suit after the city repealed the ordinance.  PRESS RELASE: Brigham City "Free Speech Zone" Ordinance Lawsuit Settled After City Repeals Ordinance >> (2/11/13) PRESS RELASE: Brigham City Suspends Enforcement of Free Speech Ordinance: Free Speech For All…
