Paralegals
The Paralegal Role
Foley Hoag's paralegals are integral members of our client teams. The nature of the work performed by paralegals depends on the practice area to which the paralegal is assigned. However, typical assignments would include tasks such as factual research, preparation and assistance at depositions and trials, and coordination of discovery projects such as document reviews. Paralegals work in all areas of the firm's practice, under the supervision of lawyers, and many of our paralegals have substantial contact with firm clients and co-counsel.
In recruiting and hiring for these positions, we look for talented and dedicated candidates who are committed to teamwork, integrity and excellence in the work they perform and throughout the workplace. We seek college graduates with good academic credentials and excellent communication and organizational skills. We are also interested in candidates who have top-notch work experience in the paralegal field.
Compensation and Benefits
The firm offers paralegals competitive salaries commensurate with their years of experience and a comprehensive benefits program. Individual and family medical, dental, life and disability insurance benefits are available. Paralegals are eligible to enroll in the firm's 401(k) plan after a brief waiting period, and in addition to voluntary contributions, the firm makes profit-sharing contributions for paralegals that have been at the firm for at least one year.
Foley Hoag values diversity in its work force. Hiring and employment decisions are made without consideration of race, color, gender, ancestry, age, religion, national origin, handicap, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information or any other legally protected status.
Equal Opportunity
At Foley Hoag, we welcome, develop, and celebrate talented and diverse individuals in an innovative, mutually respectful, and intellectually rigorous community, and bring unique perspectives to collaborative teams that deliver exceptional advice and craft bespoke legal solutions for our clients and our world. Foley Hoag LLP is an equal opportunity employer. This means that Foley Hoag LLP considers applicants for employment, and makes employment decisions without unlawful regard to sex, race, color, religion, citizenship, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, marital or domestic partner/civil union status, military service, or veteran status, disability, and any other characteristic covered by applicable federal, state or local nondiscrimination laws.
We value each person for their talents, expertise, experience, and perspective.
