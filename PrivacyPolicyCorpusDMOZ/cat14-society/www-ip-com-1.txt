Like many websites, IP.com uses commonly used information gathering tool, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the IP.com website.  IP.com also automatically collects certain information, such as internet protocol (IP address), browser type, operating system and other usage information, and stores that information in log files.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the IP.com website, track your navigation around our website, serve targeted advertising and gather broad demographic information.
Cookies and web beacons.
Cookies are small data files that a website places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage.  They assist us in making your interactions with IP.com easy and meaningful by providing enhanced functionality and aggregate traffic data. Standing alone, neither cookies nor web beacons personally identify you.  Unless you choose to identify yourself to IP.com (e.g., by filling out a web form) or have previously identified yourself to IP.com, you remain anonymous to us.
You have many choices with regards to the management of cookies on your computer.  All major browsers allow you to block or delete cookies from your system, but if you choose to block or delete cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on IP.com.  To learn more about your ability to manage cookies and web beacons, please consult the privacy features in your browser.
Third Party Advertisers.
Please note that at times, third parties may set cookies or use related technologies or web beacons when you view and/or click their advertising banners, links or other ads. Information from tracking technologies received with third party ads and links may be collected directly by those advertisers and ad service providers and used to cause relevant ads to be displayed to you. For example, these companies may collect and use information about you and your visits to IP.com and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These advertisements may appear on IP.com and on other websites. The advertiser’s privacy policy and/or that of its service provider will govern the use of this information and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such companies. We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policies to learn about how they treat your information. Additionally, some of these companies (like the ad networks) are members of the industry groups, the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, each of which offers a single location to opt out of their cookies. For more information about third party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, we encourage you to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer web site, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer choice page at http://www.aboutads.info.
Do Not Track.
IP.com does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms.
Third Party Practices.
IP.com may contain links to other websites that have their own separate terms and conditions and privacy policies.  We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, policies, and practices of any third-party websites.  The terms and conditions and privacy policies of such websites govern your use of the services offered on those websites.
Security
We employ reasonable and current security methods, including physical, technical and administrative safeguards, to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of information.  We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis.  When you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example, in public areas or through email, others can collect and use such information.  No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.  As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information transmitted to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
Transferring Personal Data from the EU to the US.
IP.com has its headquarters in the United States.  Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States.  The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union.  IP.com collects and transfers to the United States only with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of IP.com in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.  IP.com endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with IP.com and the practices described in this privacy policy.  We also minimize the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive information about you.
How can you control your information?
If you have concerns about your account information, we will work with you to review, revise and correct the personal data we have on file.  Contact us via phone at +1 585-427-8180, or, via email at support@ip.com, or use the unsubscribe method provided in our various communications or services.
Children Under 13.
You must be 13 years and older to register to use IP.com.  As a result, we do not specifically collect information about children.  If we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information as quickly as possible.
For EU data subjects.
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and other countries’ privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects.  Because IP.com is not established in the European Union, these rights only apply in relation to IP.com offering goods or services to data subjects in the European Union, or in relation to IP.com monitoring behavior in the European Union.  Among these rights is the right to know the purpose of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; who else outside of IP.com might have received the data from us; what the source of the information was (if you did not provide it directly to us); and how long the data will be stored. Additionally, you have the right to access and rectify your personal data if it is inaccurate.  You may, under certain circumstances, also request that we cease using your data for direct marketing purposes, or that we erase your data.  You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal data.  We will, at your request, provide personal data that you have provided to IP.com to you or transmit it directly to another controller if technically feasible.
How will you know if the Privacy Policy is changed?
IP.com may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email if you have an IP.com account, or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
