This week-long
experience led by distinguished UC Irvine School of Law faculty in a law school
setting is designed to equip students with knowledge, understanding, and skills
that will benefit them as they continue their education and chart their
futureto perform better in high school, prepare for college, and explore a
possible career as a lawyer.
Renowned faculty
will lead engaging morning lectures of current relevance, introducing
participants to the legal system and to major areas of law important to students. In the afternoon, students will have an opportunity to participate in mock debates, hearings, and
workshop-style sessions. This specialized program advances college readiness on
a UC

faculty aims to expand perspectives,
boost academic and professional confidence, and support career and college
interests.
With curriculum developed by UCI Law faculty, college-bound participants will become stronger candidates through a unique program of timely lectures, intellectually rigorous small group activities, lively open discussion, and practical skills enhancement.
Message from UCI Law
The High School Summer Institute in Law has been
created and designed by UCI Law faculty and staff. The
curriculum has been mindfully geared toward high school
students, not only to engage them in the study of law but
also to inspire them.
They will have the opportunity to
become familiar with different areas of law through cases
and activities that relate to the rights of students.
In addition, they will have the opportunity to
improve their speaking, arguing, and negotiating skills 
all valuable as they navigate any career path.
The University of California, Irvine School of Law is the culmination of several generations of revolutionary dreamers. Those not satisfied with the status quo who wanted to redefine, reimagine and reinvent legal education. UCI Law provides an innovative and comprehensive curriculum, and prioritizes public service and a commitment to diversity within the legal profession.
UCI Law continues to rank highly, including: The National Jurist ranks UCI Law No. 4 in the nation for practical training; U.S. News & World Report ranks UCI Law No. 23 in the nation overall out of 192 law schools, and ranks UCI Law's robust clinical program No. 7 in the nation.
We hope very much that you will join us for this exciting
program.
