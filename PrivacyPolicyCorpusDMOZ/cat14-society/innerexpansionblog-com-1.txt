Privacy Policy
The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for InnerExpansion.com (”IEW”). We reserve the right to modify the information contained herein at anytime without prior notice. If we do make changes to our privacy policies, we will modify this page accordingly. This site and all information and materials on it are provided to you “as is” without warranty of any kind.
YOUR USE OF THIS SITE, OR YOUR PROVISION TO US OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THESE TERMS; DO NOT USE THIS SITE OR PROVIDE INFORMATION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS.
Normal Browsing
As with many websites, we collect certain information, even when you are not logged in. When you browse, read, or download information from IEW, data is collected by IEW, including but not limited to your IP address, email address, URL request, browser type, and date and time of your request.
We analyze traffic to IEW in various ways, including using a service called Google Analytics. (Google Analytics is subject to the privacy policy of Google, Inc., which you can find on their website.) We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors. Unless you affirmatively provide additional information to us, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number, or social security number.
We collect the IP addresses of visitors, time of access, browser type, and web pages visited. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. For example, we track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole. We do not track information on which pages an individual user visits. We do not collect any other information without your knowledge and permission.
