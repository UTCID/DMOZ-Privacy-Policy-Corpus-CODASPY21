Supporting Our Local Community
Our community needs our help more than ever now!While navigating through uncharted territory, The Parenting PATH wants to encourage our donors to continue to support all of the local businesses that have been our partners for many years. In an effort to show them some love we are asking you to purchase gift cards to any (and all) of our favorite local spots to be donated to the 2020 Pinwheel Gala. These gift cards will help our local friends stay in business while helping us raise funds for our mission. We are even able to send you a tax letter for your donation. It's a Win-Win-Win!
This is not a comprehensive list of every business downtown, if you have other favorites please support them! Gift cards may be mailed to our offices at 500 W Northwest Blvd., Winston-Salem, NC 27105.
All cards will be placed in our silent auction when we are able to hold our 2020 Pinwheel Gala.
