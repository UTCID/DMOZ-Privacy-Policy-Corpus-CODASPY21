Donor Privacy PolicyHome » Donor Privacy Policy
The Lymphoma Research Foundation (“We” or “LRF”) has created this donor privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of LRF donors.
We will not sell, share or trade our donors’ names or personal information with another entity, nor send mail to our donors on behalf of other organizations.
This policy applies to all donor information received by LRF – both online and offline – on any platform (“platform” includes the LRF website, social media outlets and mobile application), as well as any written or oral communications.
To the extent any donations or donor information are processed through a third-party service provider, our donors’ information will only be used for purposes necessary to process the donation or donor information.
