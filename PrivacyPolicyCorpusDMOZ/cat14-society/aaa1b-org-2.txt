Help Older Adults in Your Community
Are you interested in helping others in your community? Becoming a Medicare Medicaid Assistance Program (MMAP) volunteer allows you to use your time and talents to help Medicare and Medicaid recipients understand their benefits and choices. You will help people apply for benefits, make choices during open enrollment, work through issues, find ways to lower their healthcare costs, and make sure they are getting the most out of their benefits. The Michigan Medicare Medicaid Assistance Program (MMAP) is part of the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). This national network offers free, unbiased counseling and assistance for people with Medicare or Medicaid.  MMAP volunteers are educators, advocates and guides.
Some of the Things a MMAP Volunteer Can Help With:
Providing one-one-one counseling to Medicare/Medicaid recipients
Manning a booth and answering questions at a senior or health fair
Presenting to groups at senior centers or other community venues
Who Should Become a MMAP Volunteer?
MMAP is looking for people who are computer and internet savvy. MMAP volunteers receive ongoing training and support to help them understand and keep up-to-date on Medicare and Medicaid.
