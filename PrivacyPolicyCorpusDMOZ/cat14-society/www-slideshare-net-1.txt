Further, unless both You and Scribd otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.17.4 Arbitration Rules.The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available here or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.17.5 Arbitration Process.A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration, a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents, and other forms here. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.17.6 Arbitration Location and Procedure.Unless You and Scribd otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where You reside. If Your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that You and Scribd submit to the arbitrator, unless You request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, Your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.17.7 Arbitrator’s Decision.The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. If You prevail in arbitration You will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Scribd will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.17.8 Fees.Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if Your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Scribd will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in Your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).17.9 Changes.Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification of these Terms” section above, if Scribd changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date You first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), You may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@scribd.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Scribd’s email to You notifying You of such change.
