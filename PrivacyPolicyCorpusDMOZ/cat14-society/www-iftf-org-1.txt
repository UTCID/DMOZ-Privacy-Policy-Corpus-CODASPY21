If you provide credit card information to make a donation, your credit card information is not held by IFTF. It is collected by our third party payment processors specializing in the secure processing of credit or debit card transactions. Your credit card information is not stored by IFTF.
We review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. The periods of retention depend on the type of data collected, the purpose for which the data is given, and requirements of applicable law.
Sharing Personal Information
Third Party Providers
IFTF uses third party service providers to help us operate the Website and administer activities on IFTF’s behalf, such as collecting donations online, processing applications for employment, or providing analytics, maintenance or site improvement, and operational support. These third party vendors may have access to Website visitor information, but are required to protect the confidentiality of the information and to use it only for the limited purpose for which it was provided.
If you believe personal data you provided to us is being misused by a third party, please contact us at info@iftf.org.
Compliance with Law
IFTF will share personally identifiable information about those who use our Website or communicate with us when required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. IFTF may also share personally identifiable information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of us or others.
User Consent / Other Services
From time to time, we may explicitly request consent to use your information in a manner not covered by this Policy. In such a circumstance, we would ask you to voluntarily “opt in” to agree to such use. In addition, communications through our Website often lead to additional partnership opportunities and engagements, including in relation to grantmaking, programmatic or other collaborative partnerships. IFTF may collect and use additional information in relation to those interactions, in each case as appropriate to the relationship between the parties.
Aggregated Data
IFTF may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information regarding visitors to our Website with third parties, including in connection with maintaining, improving, and fixing any operational errors on the Website.
Third Party Websites
IFTF may provide links from the Website to other websites. IFTF does not control the content or links that appear on these third party websites and is not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Website. These websites and services have their own privacy policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that have a link to or from IFTF’s Website, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected through the use of the Website. In addition, IFTF does not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals.
Compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
Protecting the privacy of minors is especially important. For that reason, IFTF never collects information at the Website from those IFTF knows are under 16, and no part of the Website is structured specifically to attract anyone under 16. If IFTF becomes aware of having information about anyone under 16, IFTF will promptly delete the information.
