Terms of Use
We're so glad you've decided to use our products and services ("Services"). These Services are provided by TntWare, Inc., located at 4845 Myrtle Bay Dr, Orlando, FL 32829. We pray that "the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God."
By using our Services, or by maintaining an active service agreement with us, you are agreeing to these terms.
Termination, Modification and Notice
You may terminate your use of our Services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.  If we have an active service agreement, you must provide written notice and you agree to pay for Services performed prior to termination.
These terms may be altered by TntWare at any time. Your continued use of our Services indicates acceptance of our terms.
All notices shall be in writing and will be considered given as follows: when delivered personally to the recipient's address, three days after being deposited in the United States mail, with postage prepaid to the recipient's address, or when sent by email to the email address of the recipient.
Dispute Resolution
"When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints?" - I Corinthians 6:1
Any claim or dispute arising from or related to these terms or our service agreement that cannot be resolved informally shall be settled by mediation and, if necessary, legally binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Christian Conciliation of the Institute for Christian Conciliation, a division of Peacemaker® Ministries (complete set of Rules available at www.Peacemaker.net). Judgment upon an arbitration decision may be entered in any court otherwise having jurisdiction. The parties understand that these methods shall be the sole remedy for any controversy or claim arising out of this agreement and expressly waive their right to file a lawsuit in any civil court against one another for such disputes, except to enforce an arbitration decision.
Data Protection and Privacy
Often, we will request a copy of your database from one of our applications ("Application Database") in the course of providing technical support.
TntWare works diligently to maintain the highest data protection and privacy standards. You will be promptly notified if it comes to our attention that we are unable to provide adequate data protection or privacy, or if we detect unauthorized or accidental Application Database access. You will be promptly notified of any legally binding request for disclosure of personal data by a law enforcement authority, unless otherwise prohibited. TntWare will deal promptly with your concerns regarding data protection and privacy. You will be notified if TntWare hires subcontractors to process your Application Database. Any subcontractors who process data will do so under the same contractual standards of data protection and privacy as TntWare as described in these terms.

However, none of the information stored in our log files or in cookies is linked to personally identifiable information.
No Warranties, Limited Liability, Third-Party Claims
Although we make every reasonable effort to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our Services, subject to regularly scheduled server and network maintenance cycles, many events and circumstances are beyond our control.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE USE OF OUR SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TNTWARE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.
UNLESS A RESULT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, TNTWARE, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND/OR CONTRACTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOST INCOME OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES. TNTWARE'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER SHALL BE FOR YOU TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND TERMINATE YOUR SERVICE AGREEMENT.

Additional Legal Details
