How your money helpsSporting activitiesSupporters networkBBC Radio 4 appealThe Bridget Lindley Memorial Fund
Our Advice Service receives most of its funding from the Department for Education, but they have cut our grant every year, and we have had to suspend our email service because the funding just did not cover it.
Your financial support, big or small, to our Advice Service appeal, will make a genuine difference in enabling us to help families in need of support. Please support us now.
For example...
For £2.50 we can print and post two advice sheets to a single father raising a severely disabled child to help him understand his rights, including how to secure support.
For £45 we can provide in depth email advice to a mother uncertain of what she needs to do to keep her children safe and avoid them going into care and desperate to do her best for her children.
For £50 we can give in-depth telephone advice to a grandparent carer bringing up a child who is at risk of exclusion from school.
For £110 we can provide indirect advocacy to a sibling who wants to raise her younger brother and so prevent him being taken into care.
For £150 one of our expert advisers can spend three hours answering queries from mothers subject to domestic abuse on our discussion forums: thereby helping not just the parents posting the queries but also all the hundreds that read the responses.
For £315 we can advocate at a child protection conference for parents who themselves are young care leavers.
For £600 we can run a face to face advice surgery at a women's prison and undertake follow up negotiations with relevant local authorities on the women's behalf, assisting mother in jail to best influence plans about their children and play a constructive role in their lives.
For £950 we can run a fun day for children and their family and friends carers, providing them with the opportunity to meet and have fun with others who have similar experiences.
For £2,300 we can help set up a support group for family and friends carers, enabling carers to regularly meet others in similar situations and help reduce their social isolation.
For £2,500 we can add a five minute information film to our website – this helps parents and carers who find written communication difficult to absorb.
For £20,000 we can produce a professional website film to help family and friends carers to represent themselves in court when they want a legal order to ensure permanency for a child who can't live with their parents.
