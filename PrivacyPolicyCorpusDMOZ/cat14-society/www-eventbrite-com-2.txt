About this Event
With federal and state aid ending this month, we are on the brink of a housing disaster. Tenants need advocates to speak to landlords about alternatives to eviction. Join us September 23, 2020 at noon when Southeast Louisiana Legal Services Housing Attorneys present how
volunteer attorneys can help a family during these trying times.
Southeast Louisiana Legal Services Staff Housing Attorney Andrew Maberry will present.
