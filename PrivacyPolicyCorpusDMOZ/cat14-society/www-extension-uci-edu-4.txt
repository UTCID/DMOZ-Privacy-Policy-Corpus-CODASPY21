Overview
In today's demanding political environment, along with the myriad of demands on civic leaders time and attention, municipal elected officials are often challenged to acquire the depth of information required to become a well-informed civic servant.
Many civic leaders were elected based on a single topic or issue that they may know about, only to find themselves launched into an environment in which they are expected to have a depth of knowledge in a variety of complex, public policy and governance issues.
Offered in collaboration with the Association of California Cities, Orange County (ACC-OC),
Public Policy Making Academy provides the learning needed to become adept at public policy making in key city and regional government areas.
This is a dynamic program focusing on the basic knowledge and skills needed to assume the role of a city elected official.
Fundamentals of city governance and finance at the local and state level, and municipal service delivery at the local and regional level will be explored.
Some of the most complex issues city elected officials will engage in, including labor negotiations and service delivery models, will also be discussed.
The program will also serve as an introductory course for individuals interested in local government policy making, and those interested in running for city elected office. University students and local government employees are also encouraged to enroll.
Who Should Attend
This program is targeted to city elected officials, specifically new city elected officials, or those interested in increasing their depth of knowledge on local government public policy.
The course is also designed to meet the needs of individuals interested in running for city council, as well as individuals interested in learning more about the field of city public policy making.
