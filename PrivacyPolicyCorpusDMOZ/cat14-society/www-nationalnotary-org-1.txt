Privacy Policy
(Last updated: March 2020)
The National Notary Association (NNA) is committed to protecting your privacy. This NNA Privacy Statement governs the data collection and usage within the NNA family of Web sites: NationalNotary.org, SigningAgent.com, NNAcnap.org and any other domain under the ownership or control of the NNA (the “NNA family of Web sites”). By visiting these Web sites, you consent to the practices set forth in this Privacy Statement. Please take a moment to review the sections below.
Collection of Your Personal Information
The personally identifiable information we collect includes information you submit to us. Because submission of such information is completely voluntary, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
The NNA may require you to enter personal information, including your name, email address, home address and telephone number when you contact us with an inquiry through our Web site. We will use such personal information for the sole purpose of contacting you with a response to your inquiry.
You also may register with the NNA by creating a “My NNA Profile.” To register, the NNA requires you to submit your name, email address, and to select a unique password. When creating your account, you must provide complete and accurate information on your own behalf using your own information, and you must keep your unique password secure. You alone are responsible for any activity that occurs on your account.
If you choose to place an order through NationalNotary.org, we require you to provide your name, shipping and billing address, email address, phone number and credit card information. This personal information is only used for order fulfillment, credit authorization, and to contact you regarding NNA business. Personal information for the role of credit card authorization may be shared with a third-party credit card processing center.
The NNA may collect information required by the states for Notary commissioning and auditing purposes, including but not limited to personal information data such as driver’s license or passport information. This information will be retained for the period designated by the commissioning state, even if you opt out or exercise your Right to be Forgotten in the European Union. Information collected for commissioning purposes may be shared with the commissioning state upon their request for the purposes of confirming commissioning information and/or auditing.
The NNA also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, referring website addresses and pages visited within NNA Web sites. This information is used by the NNA for the operation of our websites, to maintain quality of the services offered, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the NNA websites.
The NNA encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from the NationalNotary.org so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Although you may find links to many third party sites on the NNA family of Web sites, the NNA is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the NNA family of websites.
Use and Sharing of Your Personal Information
The NNA collects and uses your personal information to operate its family of Web sites and deliver the content and services you have requested. Your personal information may be used to inform you of other products or services available from the NNA. The NNA may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
The NNA does not sell, rent or lease its member/customer lists to third parties. The NNA may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (email , name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. See also the section below regarding background screenings.
To the extent permitted by law, the NNA may disclose any information (personal and non-personal) collected over our Web sites, or concerning their use, to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena, or other process that requires disclosure of information. We may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to collect debts, fight fraud or protect the rights or property of the NNA, our customers, our Web sites, or third parties, or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.
Moreover, in the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, the NNA reserves the right to transfer your personal information to the new party in control.
Collection, Use and Sharing of Personal Information for Background Screening
When you apply for NNA certification to be a Signing Agent or other NNA certification, the NNA will engage a third-party service provider to conduct a background check on you. As part of the background screening process, we require that you provide your name, shipping address, email address and phone number. The NNA will transmit this information, in encrypted form, to our service provider for processing.
Once our service provider has received your information, it will send you an email directing you to a secure Web site that will allow you to access the application for NNA certification. To complete your application, and to permit our service provider to conduct the required background screening, you will be asked to provide personal information, including your Social Security number, mother’s maiden name, date of birth, driver’s license number, as well as your email address and your home address. The personal information collected from applications will be used to obtain a consumer report to help us determine whether you meet the criteria for NNA certification, and thus, such information may be used for employment purposes in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Providing this information, including your Social Security number, is voluntary and you may refuse. However, if you do not provide us with this information, we will not be able to process your application to obtain NNA certification.
The results of your background screening will be made available to the financial industry, title insurance companies, their affiliates and/or subcontractors, on SigningAgent.com.
For more information about the background screening process, please see overview of our Signing Agent Certification.

California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident and have shared personal information with us, California law may give you the right to request and obtain from us, once per calendar year, information about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may send such requests to us via postal mail at: National Notary Association, 9350 De Soto Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311.

Security of Your Personal Information
The NNA takes reasonable precautions to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Nevertheless, NNA does not warrant or represent that its level of security meets or exceeds any particular standard. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free.
Do Not Track
NNA supports Do Not Track (DNT) Signals. DNT is a preference you can set in your internet browner to let websites you visit know that you do not want them collecting certain information about you. NNA allows third party tracking through its website. However, by implementing the DNT preference in your browser you will also prevent any third parties from tracking your information.
