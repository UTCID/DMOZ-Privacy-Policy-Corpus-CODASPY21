Your Rights as a Data Subject
The Data Subject Request Form is intended to be used when a data subject exercises one or more of the rights they are granted under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The IMM aims to take a proactive approach that places as much control over personal data in the hands of the data subject as possible, with a minimum amount of intervention or involvement from IMM.
However, in some cases, IMM will need to access the request as to whether a request will be allowed or not; where this is the case, the steps involved in this decision making will be in compliance with GDPR regulations and the lawful reasons for our data retention policies.
• The right to withdraw consent
The data subject has the right to withdraw consent where the basis for processing of their personal data is that of consent (i.e. the processing is not based on a different justification allowed by the GDPR such as contractual or legal obligation).
Before excluding the data subject’s personal data from processing, it must be confirmed that consent is indeed the basis of the processing. If not, then the request may be rejected on the grounds that the processing does not require the data subject’s consent. Otherwise, the request should be allowed.
In many cases, the giving and withdrawal of consent will be available electronically i.e. online, and this procedure will not be required.
Where consent involves a child (defined by the GDPR as age 16+ unless changed by law in individual member states) the giving or withdraw
• The right to be informed
At the point where personal data is collected from the data subject or obtained from another source, there is a requirement to inform the data subject about our use of that data and their rights over it.
• The right of access
A data subject has the right to ask IMM whether we process data about them, to have access to that data and in addition the following information:
1. The purposes of the processing
2. The categories of the personal data concerned
3. The recipients, or categories of recipients, of the data, if any, in particular any third countries or international organizations
4. The length of time that the personal data be stored for (or the criteria used to determine that period)
5. The data subject’s rights to rectification or erasure of their personal data and restriction of, or objection to, its processing
6. The data subject’s right to lodge a complaint with IMM
7. Information about the source of the data, if not directly from the data subject
8. Whether the personal data will be subject to automated processing, including profiling and, if so, the logic and potential consequences involved
9. Where the data are transferred to a third country or international organization, information about the safeguards that apply
• The right to rectification
Where personal data is inaccurate, the data subject has the right to request that it be corrected and incomplete personal data completed based on information they may provide.
Where necessary, IMM will take steps to validate the information provided by the data subject to ensure that it is accurate before amending it.
• The right to erasure
Also known as “the right to be forgotten”, the data subject has the right to require IMM to erase personal data about them without undue delay where one of the following applies:
• The personal data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected
• The data subject withdraws consent and there is no other legal ground for processing
• The data subject objects to the processing of the personal data
• The personal data have been unlawfully processed
• For compliance reasons, i.e. to meet the legal obligations of IMM
• Where the personal data was relevant to the data subject as a child
Reasonable efforts must be made to ensure erasure where the personal data has been made public.
IMM will need to make a decision on each case of such requests as to whether the request can or should be declined for one of the following reasons:
• Right of freedom of expression and information
• Compliance with a legal obligation
• To protect archiving purposes in the public interest
• The personal data is relevant to a legal claim
• The right to restrict processing
The data subject can exercise the right to a restriction of processing of their personal data in one of the following circumstances:
• Where the data subject contests the accuracy of the data, until we have been able to verify its accuracy
• As an alternative to erasure in the circumstances that the processing is unlawful
• Where the data subject needs the data for legal claims but it is no longer required by us
• Whilst a decision on an objection to processing is pending
Where a restriction of processing is in place, the data may be stored but not processed without the data subject’s consent, unless for legal reasons (in which case the data subject must be informed). Other organizations who may process the data on IMM’s behalf must also be informed of the restriction.
• The right to data portability
The data subject has the right to request that their personal data be provided to them in a “structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format” (GDPR Article 20) and to transfer that data to another party e.g. service provider. This applies to personal data for which processing is based on the data subject’s consent and the processing carried out by automated means.
Where feasible, the data subject can also request that the personal data be transferred directly from our systems to those of another provider.
For services that come under this category, little decision-making is required for each case and it is highly desirable that this process is automated in its execution.
• The right to object
The data subject has the right to object to processing that is based on the following legal justifications:
• For the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in IMM.
• For the purposes of the legitimate interests of the IMM.
Once an objection has been made, IMM must justify the grounds on which the processing is based and suspend processing until this is done. Where the personal data is used for direct marketing IMM has no choice but to no longer process the data.
• Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
The data subject has the right to not be the subject of automated decision-making where the decision has a significant effect on them and can insist on human intervention where appropriate. The data subject also has the right to express their point of view and contest decisions.
There are exceptions to this right, which are if the decision:
• Is necessary for a contract
• Is authorized by law
• Is based on the data subject’s explicit consent
In assessing these types of request, IMM will decide whether the above exceptions apply in the particular case in question.
If you would like to exercise these right in any capacity listed above, please complete the Data Subject Request Form or email us nospamprivacy@metaphysics.com
