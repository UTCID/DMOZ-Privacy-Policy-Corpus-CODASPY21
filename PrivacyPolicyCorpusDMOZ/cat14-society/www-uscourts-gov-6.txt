Criminal Justice Act (CJA) Guidelines
These policies and procedures represent the guidelines of the Judicial Conference of the United States for the administration and operation of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA). The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the right to representation by counsel in serious criminal prosecutions. Enacted in 1964, the CJA establishes a comprehensive system for appointing and compensating legal representation for accused persons who are financially unable to retain counsel in federal criminal proceedings.
