New York City Gay Hockey Association
The New York City Gay Hockey Association (NYCGHA) is New York’s first official gay hockey organization. We provide an environment free of harassment and discrimination for members and friends of the LGBT community to play ice hockey and fulfill their athletic aspirations. All members must follow our Code of Conduct.
Currently we organize eight teams in various divisions of Chelsea Piers’ adult recreational hockey program, an annual 14+ team tournament on Memorial Day Weekend, clinics throughout the summertime, holiday scrimmages, and off-ice social events through the year.
The NYCGHA is a member of Gay Hockey International and is a Nonprofit Organization under IRS code 501(c)(3).

@Skyler4149 No blood relation gives one human the right to treat another human like that. Tear that up and send it back!

@GeekyGlamGamer @BlackGirlHockey We recommend a hearty Merlot with Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia for moments like this.

RT @trot71: Fun that @NBC uses noted anti-gay advocate Tony Dungy to discuss how to deal with hate. #themoreyouknow
