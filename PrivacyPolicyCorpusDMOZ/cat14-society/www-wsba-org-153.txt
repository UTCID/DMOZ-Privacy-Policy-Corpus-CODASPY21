Admission by Lawyer Bar Examination
Updated: Dec. 5, 2020
IMPORTANT NOTICES:Dec. 3, 2020: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Dec. 3, 2020, the Washington Supreme Court issued an order  authorizing the Washington State Bar Association to administer the winter 2021 bar exam remotely.  A remote exam means that you will be able to take the exam using your computer at any location with a reliable internet connection. There will not be an in-person exam in Tacoma as previously scheduled.In addition, the court temporarily lowered the minimum passing score for the UBE to 266. The exam will remain the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE), will consist of the same components as the in-person exam, and will produce a transferrable UBE score. Note: Confirm with the corresponding UBE jurisdiction on whether or not the remote UBE exam score will be accepted in that jurisdiction. Applicants will be required to use Examsoft’s testing software to take the remote exam. As with any testing software, applicants will pay the software fee directly to Examsoft during the registration period.You may transfer your application and fee to the July 2021 bar examination which is scheduled to take place in Yakima, WA.  Alternatively, you may choose to withdraw from the exam completely by the appropriate deadline and receive a partial refund. Note: The online application system is currently unavailable. To amend, supplement, request to transfer or withdraw your online application, please contact the Admissions Office at admissions@wsba.org.We will provide additional information here as it becomes available.Nov. 1, 2020: We are currently working on a new online admissions portal. As such, new accounts or applications for the summer 2021 bar examination are not available at this time. New online accounts and applications for the summer 2021 bar exam will be available again on Feb. 1, 2021 If you have an online account and started an application but have not yet submitted the application, you will be required to start a new application for the summer 2021 bar exam beginning Feb. 1, 2021. Next Lawyer Bar ExamDate of Winter 2021 ExamFeb. 23-24, 2021Exam Site Locations:Remote Exam Using ExamSoftApplication Filing Deadlines:Oct. 5, 2020  (timely filing), Nov. 5, 2020  (late filing fee $300), Oct. 5, 2020 (failed the previous Washington summer exam only with no late fee)Exam Results Posted to Applicant's Online Account for Sept. 2020 Exam:April 9, 2021, 8 a.m. PTOther Lawyer Bar Exam DatesJuly 27-28, 2021 – New Location, Yakima Convention Center, Yakima, WashingtonPlease see Application Instructions for details.To take the Washington lawyer bar exam, you must meet the qualifications stated in Washington Supreme Court Admission and Practice Rule (APR) 3.
