Privacy Policy
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
iPetitions collects information at different points on our website. The two main points at which we
collect information are when new members join iPetitions and when outside users sign a petition powered
by iPetitions.
Members: When you become a member of iPetitions, you provide us with your name and other
information, email address. iPetitions is the sole owner of this information and we will not sell,
share, or rent this information with any other company or individual in ways different from what is
disclosed in this statement. From time to time, we may share your information with others on an
aggregated basis. We will not share information in such a way that it can be linked to an individual.
Sign: When you sign a petition powered by iPetitions, you will be asked for your name,
and you may be asked for your email address as well as certain demographic information. Some of this
information may be optional, but we encourage you to provide it as it will allow us to better customize
your experience. In addition, we store your IP address in our database. The information you provide and
your IP address are stored on our servers but can also be accessed by the petition host, who is a member
of iPetitions and who has agreed to the terms of this privacy policy. As with the information you supply
iPetitions, hosts will be asked not to sell, share, or rent this information with any other company or
individual except in an aggregated form.
There are three possible exceptions to this rule, however, and those are when 1) a petition host submits
a petition to its intended recipient; or 2) on the "Signatures" section of the petition. In the second
case, your email address will never be publicly visible, and you have the option when signing a petition
of asking that your name also not be displayed. In the first case, it is up to the discretion of the
petition host as to what information he or she may submit to the petition's intended recipient. Petition
hosts may choose to submit emails and names (as well as other information) as such information is likely
to enhance the credibility of a petition.
Please be aware that this applies only to petitions powered by iPetitions on iPetitions' servers (these
petitions will have a URL of the form: http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/some_petition). Petitions
sponsored by external organizations but using our software may have different privacy policies.
3) The third exception: iPetitions may disclose user or signer information when we have
reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary for legal reasons. We may do so in
response to a specific legal query, or even without such a query if we have reason to believe that
sharing such information may be: in the interests of public or private safety; necessary to prevent or
remedy an illegal or potentially illegal act (in any jurisdiction of the world); necessary to prevent
harm to iPetitions, our members, users, or any other member of the public anywhere in the world; or any
other reason which we believe to be valid or necessary. In the event we share information in response to
a specific legal query or request (including but not limited to a court order, police request, or
subpoena), we may choose solely at our own discretion to waive the requirement of service of summons and
respond to a verbal, emailed or other request. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN
IPETITIONS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SHARING INFORMATION IF WE HAVE SHARED THE INFORMATION WITH THE BELIEF
(WHETHER THAT BELIEF LATER PROVES FOUNDED OR UNFOUNDED) THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR LEGAL OR OTHER
REASONS.
Please be aware that these exceptions and policies (as well as those contained elsewhere in this Privacy
Statement) apply only to petitions powered by iPetitions on iPetitions' servers. Petitions sponsored by
external organizations but using our software may have different privacy policies.
Ad Services: In addition, some user information is collected by third-party ad services.
Users always have a choice of whether to supply this information and in no case is the information
collected without their knowledge. iPetitions does not maintain any control over the information
supplied to these ad services and this information will be used in accordance with the privacy policies
of these outside services. iPetitions uses these services in order to allow us to keep supplying free
and subsidized petition services. We have screened external privacy policies to ensure that personal
user information is not misused, but we encourage users with concerns to contact us directly. YOU
EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT IPETITIONS CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY PRIVACY VIOLATIONS CONDUCTED BY THIRD
PARTY SITES OR APPLICATIONS THAT WE USE ON OUR SITE.

COOKIES
In line with standard industry practices, we use cookies to keep track of user sessions and other

thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The
only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also
enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no
access to or control over these cookies.
LOG FILES
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use, and prevent duplicate signatures.

friends. The email addresses entered for these friends is not stored by iPetitions and will be used only
once before being discarded.
NOTIFICATIONS

information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

everything we can to ensure that such information is handled in an appropriate manner, we encourage
users with concerns to visit the sites in question and review their privacy and other policies.
We do not store credit card or other payment information on our servers. However, we may access such
information via the third party payment services we use.
SITE AND SERVICE UPDATES
We send members occasional site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe
from service announcements, which contain important information about iPetitions.
CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer
desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal
data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer
Support.
