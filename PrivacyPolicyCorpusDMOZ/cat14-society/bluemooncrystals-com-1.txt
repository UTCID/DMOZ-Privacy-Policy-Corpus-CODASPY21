Shipping Policy Fast & Free shipping within the United States with no minimum.  For orders under $30 your package will be delivered by United States First Class Mail and should arrive within 3 to 5 days of shipping.  For orders $30 or more your package will be shipped by United States Postal Service Priority Mail and should arrive within 1 to 3 days of shipping. We usually ship your order the next business day.  We may use UPS Ground delivery for large, heavy orders and notify you of when to expect delivery.  Rates may change.
CanadaWe ship to Canada using United States Postal International Priority Mail service.  You will be authorized for this service at $39.99, but we will calculate the actual shipping cost and only charge your credit card or PayPal the actual shipping cost.  We may have to refund your credit card or PayPal account the difference.  We will contact you if additional shipping fees are necessary.  Your package should arrive within 6 to 10 business days of shipping.  You will be responsible for paying your customs duty and VAT (when applicable).  Rates may change.
International Orders We do ship to some limited locations internationally. Please email us with the item(s) you are interested in and your full mailing address. We will let you know if we can ship there and if there will be any additional shipping fees.  Usually the shipping cost and options are very similar to Canada, but can be a little more.  You will be responsible for paying your customs duty and VAT (when applicable).  Rates may change.
