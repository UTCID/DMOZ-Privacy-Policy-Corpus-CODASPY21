Megan Phelps-Roper, the granddaughter of infamous preacher Fred Phelps who founded the Westboro Baptist Church, announced Monday afternoon she had finished the final draft of her book, “This Above All,” and that her story was in the works to become a movie.Phelps-Roper left Westboro Baptist Church in 2013.“Update: I finished the first draft of my book a few weeks ago, and now a film is in the works, taken on by some incredibly talented people—Nick Hornby, Reese Witherspoon, Bruna Papandrea, Marc Webb, Bill Pohlad, and Condé Nast Entertainment,” Phelps-Roper said on Facebook. “This has been percolating for a year and a half, and is still utterly unbelievable.”According to information published by The Hollywood Reporter, Marc Webb is set to direct the feature film based on Phelps-Roper’s life. In addition to her memoir, Nick Hornby will pen the screenplay from a New Yorker article written by Adrian Chen in 2015.Dawn Ostroff and Jeremy Steckler will produce for Condé Nast Entertainment, along with Webb. Bruna Papandrea, Reese Witherspoon and Bill Pohlad of River Road Entertainment, who previously worked with Hornby on the film adaption of Wild, will also produce, according to The Hollywood Reporter.In her early 20’s, Phelps-Roper was a prominent figure among the WBC community, managing the group’s Twitter site beginning in 2009 when the social media site rose in popularity. According to her 2015 New Yorker article, people became drawn to Phelps-Roper’s lightheartedness and goofy spirit on Twitter, and she used the platform to openly discuss her views with other Tweeters.In multiple interviews, Phelps-Roper credits Twitter with the early-stages of opening her eyes to other ways of seeing. Through Twitter she formed a rapport with David Abitbol, founder of the blog Jewlicious, and met her now husband, Chad Fjelland.Halsnøy Island.August 15, 2016.Day 1 of forever pic.twitter.com/6Z3yLobfh5— Megan Phelps-Roper (@meganphelps) August 15, 2016According to her Facebook page, Phelps-Roper married Fjelland on Aug. 15, 2016. She originally started messaging her husband via Twitter in February 2011. In the New Yorker, Phelps-Roper expanded on her relationship with Fjelland, saying the two often conversed over messaging through the app “Words with Friends.” She went on her first date with Fjelland in Omaha in 2014, a few months after leaving WBC.In November 2013, Phelps-Roper and her younger sister, Grace, left the church. Staying with former teachers, cousins and even Abitbol — whom she had previously condemned — the sisters moved often after leaving their family. Since then the pair have been disowned by their family, but according to a New Yorker article, Phelps-Roper recalls her mother saying “You know you can always come back.”A year later, The Capital-Journal reported that a fourth Phelps-Roper sibling, then 23-year-old Zach, had also left the church.Phelps-Roper did not respond for comment Monday.
