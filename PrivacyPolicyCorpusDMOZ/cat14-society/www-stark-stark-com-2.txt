Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy describes how Stark & Stark, A Professional Corporation dba Stark & Stark Attorneys at Law (referred to herein as “Stark & Stark,” “we”, “us”, “our” as the case may be) collects and uses cookies about you through our website (“Site”).
What are Cookies?
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is downloaded on to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are used by many websites and can do a number of things, e.g., remembering your preferences and counting the number of people looking at a website.
How do we use Cookies?
We use cookies on this Site for the following purposes:
Analytical purposes: Analytical cookies allow us to recognize, measure and track visitors to our Site. This helps us to improve and develop the way our Site works, for example, by determining whether Site visitors can find information easily, or by identifying the aspects of the Site that are of the most interest to them.
Google Analytics. This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). The information generated by the cookie about your use of this Site is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
On behalf of the operator of this Site, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Site, to compile reports on Site activity and to provide other services related to Site activity and internet usage to the Site operator. The IP address provided by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged.
Google has developed a browser add-on to allow users to opt-out of Google Analytics across all websites that use this popular analytics product.
Usage preferences: Some of the cookies on our Site are activated when visitors to our Site make a choice about their usage of the Site. Our Site then ‘remembers’ the settings preferences of the user concerned. This allows us to tailor aspects of the Site to the individual user.
Terms and conditions: We may use cookies on our Site to record when a Site visitor has seen a policy, such as this one, or provided consent, such as consent to the terms and conditions on our Site. This helps to improve the user’s experience of our Site – for example, it reduces the need for users to repeatedly consent to the same terms.
Session management: This type of cookie helps the website track internet usage. Session cookies are temporary and are deleted from your machine when your web browser closes.
Functional purposes: Functional purpose cookies store information that is needed by our applications to process and operate. For example, where transactions or requests within an application involve multiple workflow stages, cookies are used to store the information from each stage temporarily, in order to facilitate completion of the overall transaction or request.
Third party cookies. When you visit our Site, you may receive cookies that are set by third parties. These cookies are used for the purposes described in the bullet points above. We do not control the setting of these third party cookies, so we suggest you might wish to check the third party websites for more information about their use of cookies and how to manage them.
