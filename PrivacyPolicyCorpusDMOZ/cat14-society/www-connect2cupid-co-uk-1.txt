You are entering into this agreement with NSI (Holdings) Limited.
We have an extensive network of sites (that we call our “Partner Sites”) that we categorise as Traditional Sites (for traditional romantic relationships e.g. Cupid.com) and Niche Sites (for like-minded people to meet e.g. UniformDating.com).
Any reference herein to a Group Company means a parent or subsidiary of ours, if applicable.
We want to offer you a full range of products and services and in order to do that we will share your details across our Partner Sites (see our privacy policy - Creation of Duplicate Profiles Across Our Partner Sites) and we will market our different products and services to you (see our privacy policy - Marketing).
You authorise us to reproduce and broadcast the information contained in your profile including your name, photograph, "chat up line", description etc. throughout all or part of our Partner Sites and our Group Companies for the purposes of delivering the Services to you and for marketing and other purposes as explained in more detail below under section 6(B) Our rights to use your content for our own purposes.
We may, from time to time, create profiles which are created, maintained and managed by our employees ("Staff Profiles"). The purpose of these Staff Profiles is to enable us to ensure our Services are operating properly by testing the Services, features and functionalities, and to research our products and Services. All Staff Profiles will be identifiable as such and in the event that you opt to communicate or interact with a Staff Profile you will be made aware of the nature of this Staff Profile. In an effort to protect users from receiving deceptive links and content through messages sent from individuals our systems have flagged as scammers, we will censor any flagged messages and replace the content of these messages with links to our partner sites. Any censored messages will be marked with a special icon tooltip to explain that the SiteAdmin has flagged the message and replace the content with safer links.

(3) By registering for the Services as a member and purchasing a subscription package (“Paid Member”).
Throughout these terms we will make reference to Guest, Basic Member and Paid Member. When the clause is relevant to all members, we shall simply use the term “member” or “users” to mean all users, whether Guests, Basic, or Paid.
4. ABOUT SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BILLING
A. GUEST/BASIC MEMBER FEES / CHARGES / "JOIN FOR FREE"
There is no fee payable to access the Services as a Guest or as a Basic Member.
However, please note that accessing the Services as a Guest or a Basic Member will only give you limited access to features and areas of the Services. Full access will require to you upgrade to become a Paid Member, by paying for a subscription package.
When you see "JOIN FOR FREE" this means that you can sign up to the Services free of charge, however you will have limited access to features and areas of the Service. Full access will require a Paid Membership.
B. PAID MEMBER FEES / CHARGES
If you would like full access to all features and areas within the Services, you should purchase one of our Subscription Packages which can differ across our various websites. As a Paid Member you expressly agree to us providing the Services to you immediately upon payment by you.
In general, we offer:
3 day or 1 week trials (with some services offering 1 hour trials); and/or
1, 3 or 6 month packages.
The fees payable for each of our Subscription Packages are set out on the payment page at the point of making payment. Please review the payment page very carefully when you come to make payment.
Please be aware that when you subscribe to any package, including the trial period, you will become liable for automatic renewal billing. THIS MEANS THAT THE MINIMUM DURATION OF YOUR CONTRACT WILL BE FOR THE INITIAL PERIOD YOU SELECT (E.G. 1 MONTH), AND THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SERVICE.
We reserve the right to alter these subscriptions packages at any time. If we alter the price of a package that you are already paying for, we will provide notice of the change to (in accordance with our process noted below at section 4(D)) you and you will have the option to cancel your membership if you do not agree with the new price being offered to you.
C. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL BILLING
We operate an automatic renewal billing policy.
This means that once your initial membership period has expired, for your convenience, your membership will automatically be renewed at the same rate that you signed up for using the original payment method. For example if you pay by credit card, we will continue to debit this same credit card as each subscription period expires. We will only debit these repeat payments when your current payment period expires and not before.
D. PRICE CHANGES
We reserve the right to alter our packages at any time and any change in your subscription price will be notified to you by email to the address you have provided when you signed up to the Services, at least 7 days prior to the new subscription price being implemented. You will then have the option to cancel your membership if you do not agree to this price change.
E. DISPUTES ABOUT BILLING
In the event that you disagree with any charge made to your account, you agree to contact us with a view to resolving the dispute prior to making a formal notification to your credit card company. You must contact us either by email or telephone, stating your reasons for dispute of the charge. This will enable us to accurately and promptly assess your complaint and, where justified, credit your card with the disputed amount in a timely manner to avoid any further inconvenience to you.
