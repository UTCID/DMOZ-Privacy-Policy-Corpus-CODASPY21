Additionally, FAS may collect site use information, such as what pages site users access and visit, or what browsers site users utilize to access the Website, on an anonymous and aggregate basis as you and others browse our Website.  This information is used to give us a better understanding of how the Website is being used by the users and to provide better service to users.
Whenever FAS collects personally identifiable about you, it reserves the right to use that information for marketing FAS and its various activities..  FAS may use the personally identifiable data collected to undertake a variety of marketing activities including, but not limited to, email, direct mail, site personalization, telephone marketing and other digital and traditional methods of advertising and communication.  FAS does not sell or “monetize” data to 3rd parties.  FAS, however, may send marketing messages on behalf of its sponsors and partners.  It will do so without giving any of your personally identifiable information to those sponsors and partners for their own use.
V. Personal Information You Choose to Provide.
Registration Information.  You will provide us with certain information about yourself, your firm or company, and/or your credit card information when you register on certain parts of the Website, or register to become a donor.
Email Information.  If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.
Site Use Information.  Similar to other commercial websites, FAS utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used.  Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after FAS.  We, our advertisers, and ad serving companies may also use small technology or pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.
How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?  Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, improving the content and quality of our services and the Website, and making available other products and services.  Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at tamarack@tamarackcamps.com.  We may also use your information for billing, identification, and/or authentication purposes.
Disclosure of Personal Information.  We may disclose your personal information if required: (a) by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process served on us or affiliated parties; (b) to protect and defend our rights and property, our site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties, against any threat, whether it be to physical safety or property; (c) to take action against suspected fraud or illegal activities, regardless of whether we or our affiliated parties have been served with any legal process; or (d) to take action to prevent or respond to any violation of our Terms of Service.
What Are Cookies? A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.  When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.  Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites.  We have no access or control over those cookies.You can decide if and how your computer will accept cookies by configuring your preferences option within your web browser.  To disable this function in your web browser, choose the “help” menu and follow the instructions for deleting cookies and preventing your browser from downloading additional cookies.  Use of the FAS service requires your acceptance of cookies.  FAS does not permanently store personal or confidential information in cookies (although our third party advertisers may – and we take no responsibility for their actions).  You may be required to login to your FAS page after a certain amount of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.
How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? As you browse, the Website uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security.  Cookies, in conjunction with our server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting the Website and which parts of the site are most popular.  This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Website and better serve site users. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.
Sharing Information with Third Parties. We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that you have explicitly requested.  In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party.  We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments.  In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information we collect will never be shared or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes except  to provide products or services you requested or unless we have your permission to share such information.
Site Postings. Our Website offers publicly accessible postings.  You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas becomes public information and may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.  We recommend that you do not post your email address or other personal information in these postings because this information is publicly available for anyone to see and unscrupulous third parties may use this information to form ‘spam’ lists or may otherwise misuse this information.  We are not responsible for the use or misuse of information posted by you in public postings by other users of the Website.

FAS uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Website.  Please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at tamarack@tamarackcamps.com.

It was incredible. My son came home so confident and had an amazing experience. He grew independent, aware of others, and has memories that are life-lasting. Almost 2 weeks home and Agree experiences and smiles keep showing up.
Steve, Agree Dad
Both of my children had an amazing time at camp this summer. I just wanted to say thank you to the amazing staff for making their first time awesome! They were both so nervous when they got on the bus and were so sad about being away from camp when they got home! Overall, camp was a huge success!
Ryan, Camp Maas Parent
My happiest memories were my summers at Tamarack. Everyone who stood up in my wedding were friends I met during my camp days.
Jeff, Tamarack Alumnus
As my daughter wrote in her last letter home  I have never been more happy! You can’t ask for anything more! Camp truly is the greatest place.
Sandy, Camp Maas Parent
Being a Tamarack staff member means having the best job on earth at the greatest place on earth, getting to change people’s lives daily and making memories and friends forever!
Maddie, Camp Maas Counselor
As an alumni and now a parent, I wouldn’t want my kids anywhere else. They look forward to their time at camp for 340 days of the year! Thank You!
Sarah, Tamarack Parent & Alumnus
My child came home and would have liked to get right back on the bus to go back! He talked about how much he loved his counselors and the friends he made. It was a great summer for him.
Lauren, Happy Tamarack Parent
Living technology-free and in the woods helped to build a sense of rugged, pure community. The bonds created between campers and staff, memories made, and adventures had are like no other. I am beyond grateful for my Kennedy experience, and I can truly say that it changed my life.
Anna, Kennedy Camper
I love camp and its incredible people. I made great friends and only have wonderful memories!
Ella, Camper
I send my kids to Tamarack every year for the past 6 years. From the second they get on the bus headed to their second home in Ortonville until they are returned to me, I do not worry about them. I know that they are safe. I know that they are growing. I know that they are making lifelong friendships. Thank you!
