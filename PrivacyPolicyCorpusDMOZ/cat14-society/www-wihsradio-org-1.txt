Comments & Form Submissions
When website visitors submit comments or completed forms, we share the information provided
with the appropriate WIHS staff member or volunteer for follow-up.
Staff and volunteers are instructed and expected to be vigilant and discreet with the information that is shared.
WIHS does not share information collected with other organizations or private parties.
We do not sell lists for commercial use. If you share a testimony, we may choose to publish your message generically, without mentioning you by name.
In the interest of keeping in touch and building relationships with website visitors, WIHS may automatically add website visitors who submitted comments or completed forms to our mailing databases (traditional mail and/or email)
and send periodic WIHS-generated news and information that may be of interest. Recipients are free to contact WIHS to have their contact information deleted from our lists.
Analytics
WIHS uses Google Analytics to track website usage.
Statistics gathered are used for internal purposes only, to help us to understand what content is of most use, where website visitors are located, what content we should consider dropping or adding to make the ministry more effective.
