Not seeing what you're looking for? Contact us.Be Proactive About Succession Planning
Life is unpredictable, so it’s important to have a succession plan in case unexpected events like disability or death prevent you from practicing law and managing the day-to-day operations of your law firmWhile lawyers are not required to have a succession plan, they are strongly encouraged to do so. Planning ahead protects your clients and your family, and provides guidance to your staff in a time of uncertainty.Designate an Assisting AttorneyAnother lawyer should be designated to have the authority to review client files and make determinations as to which files need immediate attention.Establish a Protocol for Notifying ClientsDetermine who must notify the clients of your death or incapacitation. Reasonable efforts must be made to contact all clients and to request instructions.Designate an Assisting Attorney for Trust AccountsAllowing someone else access to the trust account is a serious matter. If the assisting person misappropriates funds, the lawyer or his/her estate may be held responsible.
