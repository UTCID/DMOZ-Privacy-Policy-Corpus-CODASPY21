Category: Our Must Reads
Created on 08 December 2011
Putin’s Canny Politics in Russian Elections by Gregory Feifer in The Washington Post. Putin detractors in the U.S. and elsewhere may be premature in jumping on the United Russia party’s poor showing in the Duma elections as a sign that the leader is starting to lose his grip on power.

Pelicans
and marsh grass were not the only victims of the BP oil spill in the
Gulf of Mexico. Another casualty was in Britain among some people there
who felt aggrieved that their country seemed to get no specially gentle handling from the
White House in the name of the “special relationship” between the U.S.
and UK. That longstanding concept of a special bilateral tie has only
slowly faded in London, even under the new government. But
