Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage,

The Information We Collect
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the My Christmas Wish List website. We
collect information from you when you register on our site, or when you make updates to personal information
within your profile. The types of personal information collected on these pages are: name and email address. We
do not collect any sensitive financial or identity information such as credit/debit card information, social
security numbers, physical address, driver's license number, etc.
Like most websites, we use cookies and/or web beacons to enhance your experience, gather general visitor information, and track visits to our website. Please refer to the

The Way We Use Information
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs).
This is what makes it possible to have your own profile and wish list.
To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you).
To answer the email we receive using the return email addresses. Such addresses are not used for any
other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
To use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with
advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on
our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
To send periodic emails including, but not limited to, login and password retrieval, messages from other
users in your group(s), and news, updates, or reminders about the site itself.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
