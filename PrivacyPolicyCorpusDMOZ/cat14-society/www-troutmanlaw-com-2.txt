Do I Need a Lawyer for Disability to File a Claim in Oklahoma?
Tulsa SSDI Attorneys Explain When Disability Cases May Benefit from Legal Representation
When researching information about applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits online, you will run into many sites discussing how you can file a claim on your own. However, for most people, this may not be the best choice for their situation.
Our Tulsa Social Security attorneys can help you navigate the application and appeals process. We know the judges in and around the Tulsa district and have worked with them for many years. Our SSDI attorneys can help you succeed with a disability claim because we ensure all evidence documenting your disability is accurate.
Many law firms say they can handle Social Security claims. However, our Tulsa Social Security law firm is unique because disability law is all we do.
Applying for Oklahoma SSI or SSDI? Get an Experienced Tulsa Lawyer for Disability on Your Side
Since we opened our firm, our Oklahoma disability lawyers have taken pride working directly with clients in and around Tulsa, Broken Arrow and Owasso. We helped them gain benefits successfully for their disability claims. It is our job to know the best methods for filling out applications as well as how to be successful in disability appeals hearings. We take our job very seriously.
Many nationwide Social Security law firms do very little to address the questions or needs of clients. They are more interested profits and thus take on disability cases in mass numbers. Our Tulsa disability law firm is local. An attorney on site handles every case—not an assistant or an aide.
Our disability attorneys are also sustaining members of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives (NOSSCR). This organization commits to representing people with disabilities through the Social Security process and then advocating for their income rights. We frequently attend NOSSCR conferences and teach seminars focusing strictly on disability law. This then helps us stay informed on how best to meet the very specific needs our clients may have.
Not Sure If You Need a Lawyer for Disability to Help File Your Claim?
By working with our Tulsa SSDI attorneys, we will help make the best argument possible for benefits and improve your chances at winning your disability case by:
Ensuring you meet all deadlines
Providing medical records directly to your Social Security office and/or the Disability Determination Services (DDS) examiner assigned to your case
Working directly with your doctors and healthcare providers
Eliminating harmful information from files
Cross-examining vocational experts
Reviewing and appealing denial decisions by the Social Security Administration (SSA)
If your SSDI application has been denied or you are in the process of finalizing it, then the decision to hire a disability attorney should be an easy one to make.
Call Our Tulsa Social Security Lawyers for Honest and Free Advice
Our lawyers work on a contingency basis. This means we are only paid a limited portion of your past due Social Security disability benefits if we are successful. The SSA regulates these fees. What you pay a non-attorney representative to represent a disability claim is the same you would pay an experienced disability lawyer.
Make sure you get a lawyer for disability you can trust to have your best interests at heart. For more information and a free evaluation of your claim, then contact our disability attorneys in Oklahoma. You can call (918) 587-0050 or fill out the case review form on this page.
In a field as complicated and ever-changing as Social Security disability law, the services of a disability attorney to handle your claim can help tremendously. Any mistakes made in the original paperwork will continue to be part of the file and will come back to haunt people if an appeal is necessary. In this video, Oklahoma SSDI lawyer Steve Troutman explains how Social Security disability’s requirements continue to evolve and the ways a lawyer can help.
If you are worried about the cost of a Tulsa disability lawyer, you should know that you will not have to pay exorbitant attorney fees. Disability law says that attorneys can only take either 25 percent of back benefits or $6,000, whichever is less. This means that the most you will ever have to pay an attorney is $6,000 out of the lump sum back payment award, and most attorney fee awards are less. Your future benefits are all yours to keep in full. You can reach us at (918) 587-0050 or at our website, TroutmanLaw.com.

Point of Interest When people apply for SSDI without legal representation, they can make costly mistakes that lead to a disability claim being dismissed or delayed. This is because the SSDI and SSI disability process is complex. In fact, the overwhelming majority of initial disability applications will receive denials.
