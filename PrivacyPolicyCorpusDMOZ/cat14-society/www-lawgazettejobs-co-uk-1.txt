Privacy Notice
This privacy notice includes specific information concerning data collected via this website: https://jobs.lawgazette.co.uk. This notice should be read in conjunction with the Law Society's main privacy policy, which can be accessed here:

Registration and registration information for job seekers
It is not necessary for you to register with us in order to access this website. But if you do register it will allow us to personalise our services and offer you some additional benefits.
If you apply for a job without registering, we will collect your name, email address and a copy of your CV if you upload it.
If you register, we will collect your name, your email address and any information that you store in your online profile (e.g. your PQE and practice interests), including a copy of your CV. If you do register, you are responsible for protecting your password and user name and must not share them with, nor disclose them to, anyone else.
We will use your email address to send you job alerts (if you register for these).
If you consent to receive marketing from us, we use this information to send you information by email about our other services and products and important job site updates.
Email job alerts
You can request email job alerts to be received either in plain text or html versions, with the frequency available on either a daily or weekly basis.
Changing the information we hold about you
If you would like to change the registration information we hold about you on this site or want to be removed from our registration database, or if you want to change the email address at which you receive email job alerts or the format or frequency of those email job alerts, you may do so by logging in to your account and changing or removing your details as you wish.
Third Parties
If you register with this site and choose to upload your CV to your profile, your profile will automatically be made available to employers, including recruitment consultants, to view through the site's CV search facility. If your CV includes contact details for you, uploading your CV means these details will be visible to employers or recruiters using the CV search facility and you may be contacted by them using these details.  You can choose in your profile settings whether or not you wish to make your CV available to employers and recruiters in this way, and which contact details you wish to disclose.
You can do this when you create your profile or at any time afterwards.
You will also be asked to upload a copy of your CV if you apply for a job through this site, and this will be forwarded to the relevant recruiter.
We will not disclose any other information we have already collected about you through this site without your consent other than where required to do so by law. At all times, the Law Society will control and be responsible for the use of your information.
