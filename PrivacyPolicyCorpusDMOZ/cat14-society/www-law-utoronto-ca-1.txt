Admissions Policies
These admission policies apply to both domestic (Canadian citizens and permanent residents) and international applicants.UPDATE: Credit/No Credit (CR/NCR) grades on the 2019-2020 academic record due to COVID-19Statement of Admission PolicyApplication of Admission PolicyStandards for Admission: competitive LSAT scores & GPAGeneral ApplicantsMature ApplicantsIndigenous ApplicantsHalf Time ProgramCombined ProgramsDeferral of AdmissionsPrevious ApplicantsNotice concerning Freedom of Information and Protection of PrivacyStatement of Admission PolicyThe Faculty of Law seeks to identify and select a student body of diverse interests and backgrounds that demonstrates unusual promise for distinguished performance at the law school, and, subsequently, in the legal profession and community.The law school is enriched by a student body made up of students from various ethnic, racial, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, from different regions of Canada, as well as a range of academic disciplines, careers and community and extracurricular experiences.The Admissions Committee, chaired by a faculty member and including the Assistant Dean, JD Program, several other faculty members and a number of third-year students, chooses those applicants it judges are likely to complete the program with the greatest intellectual return. The Faculty believes that the qualities of mind and personality necessary to satisfy its requirements are:high intelligence;sound judgment;the capacity and motivation for demanding intellectual effort;the capacity and motivation to engage in sophisticated legal reasoning; andan understanding of and sensitivity to human interaction.As evidence of these qualities, the Admissions Committee looks to a number of factors. These include:academic achievement;The standard Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score(s);non-academic achievement;the response to disadvantage due to adverse personal or socio-economic circumstances or to barriers faced by cultural (including racial or ethnic) or linguistic minorities;motivation and involvement in academic and non-academic activities; andthe impact of temporary or permanent physical disabilities.The Faculty seeks a diverse, stimulating and highly motivated student body. Thus, the Admissions Committee also gives weight to work experience, graduate study, outstanding accomplishment in a non-academic activity, and other special circumstances brought to its attention.Back toApplication of Admission PolicyAdmission to the Faculty of Law is selective. In each cycle, generally 2,000 applications are received for about 200 first-year places in the JD program, with fewer than 300 offers of admission. There are three categories of admission: general, mature and Indigenous. Within each admissions group, an applicant's file is reviewed carefully in its entirety. Black students may apply through the Black Student Application Process (BSAP). The Committee reviews applications taking into account a wide array of considerations. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the probability of admission using numerical indices.The Admissions Committee's approach means that it gives a full reading to the materials submitted, and considers many academic, professional and personal factors in its attempt to evaluate each candidate's demonstrated potential for enriching the Faculty and, thereafter, for contributing meaningfully to the legal community and society. However, in view of the large number of candidates whose applications disclose excellent academic records, strong LSAT scores and worthy non-academic accomplishments, candidates without these characteristics are less competitive for admission.Because of the large number of applications, no formal interviews or in person meetings are conducted. The JD Admissions Office staff is available to answer questions in person, by telephone, or in writing. They are extremely knowledgeable about the admissions process and able to assist applicants on all matters regarding their applications.Assessment of Academic RecordOur review of an applicant's undergraduate record is based on the principle that undergraduate records should be compared as fairly as possible across applicants. For this reason, we examine the pattern of the intensity of the course work taken across an applicant's undergraduate career (light versus heavy, full-time versus part-time, co-op versus regular, introductory versus upper-year courses, courses on exchange, courses during the summer term). We also examine the patterns of results the applicant achieved in that coursework (increasing trends, sustained periods of strong performance, short-term deviations, cumulative results, etc). Moreover, we take into account the nature of the program and the undergraduate institution (or institutions) at which an applicant has studied. Specifically, programs and institutions have varying grading practices, which we take into account in our assessment. In general, the Admissions Committee examines each applicant's academic record with a view to meaningful and fair comparisons of undergraduate performance.The Faculty does not recommend particular graduate or undergraduate courses for those seeking admission. Many outstanding law students come to law school from undergraduate disciplines or other experiences seemingly unrelated to the study of law. It is suggested that students treat these experiences as ends in themselves rather than as preparation for law school.The most competitive applicants are those with a consistent record of academic achievement over three or four years in a challenging undergraduate program, and, if applicable, in graduate work as well. In the absence of special circumstances, an inconsistent undergraduate record will normally be less competitive. In borderline cases, a very strong performance in a graduate program may overcome modest weaknesses in an undergraduate record, but will not usually overcome an undergraduate record which is otherwise un-competitive. An applicant's academic record and LSAT score (or scores) are considered together and in context. That is, an applicant with a superior academic record may be admitted with a less competitive LSAT results. Similarly, an applicant with superior LSAT results may be admitted with a less competitive academic record.More information about how the academic record of currently-registered students is assessed can be found in the Application Procedure section.  Standards for Admission 2016-2020The admissions assessment is based two-thirds on the academic record and the standard LSAT score(s), and one-third on personal information. The law school does not predetermine a minimum level of performance, rather the strongest candidates are selected from the application pool based on the complete person profile, and not just the numerical measures. Accordingly, our metrics do not list a minimum, instead they list the median (i.e. midpoint) performance of the entering class. Competitive LSAT performanceHIGHEST LSAT OF FIRST YEAR JD CLASS BY YEAR OF ENTRY

In many instances it cannot be obtained mathematically due to the nature of the full post-secondary academic record, such as, but not limited to, candidates who:enrolled in co-op programsparticipated in exchange programsattended institutions located outside of Canada or the USAattended different institution types (e.g. CEGEP and university, Ontario CAAT and university)enrolled in a mix of part-time and full-time course loadsThis is not cause for alarm. The performance on courses taken - wherever and however - will be assessed on its own merit, as described in Application of Admission Policy above. Therefore, all candidates should focus on how they performed in general, instead of a GPA calculation.Note on courses taken on a student exchangeIt is customary for the home institution, on its own transcript, to list the amount of credit granted only, and not list the grades obtained for exchange courses. The exchange grade performance will be assessed on its own merit using the host institution's transcript and grading scale. With different grading scales, the regular method of calculating our GPA may not be possible, and instead the performance at each institution will be assessed on its own merit. Competitive admission GPA performanceADMISSION GPA OF FIRST YEAR JD CLASS BY YEAR OF ENTRY

However, prospective applicants should be aware that almost all of our students have completed a four-year degree.Required documents for regular applicants can be found in the Application Procedure section. Back to Top Mature ApplicantsMature applicants are those who have or will have at least five complete years of non-academic experience by September of the year of entry into the law school. The years of non-academic experience need not be consecutive, but must have been undertaken independently of academic work. Such experience may consist of both remunerated work and unpaid labour, including the care and raising of children.In addition to an applicant's academic record, the Committee will consider an applicant's ability to organize his or her life and work, ability to reason, analyze and engage in intellectual inquiry, and past experience. The Committee may place less emphasis on the applicant's academic record where there has been a significant lapse of time since its completion or where adverse personal or socio-economic circumstances, including linguistic and cultural barriers, have affected its development.For those mature applicants with fewer than two years of undergraduate university study, the Admissions Committee may give greater weight to other evidence of ability to study law successfully, such as experience or success in another field of endeavour. However, in view of the large number of qualified applicants who have at some time demonstrated their academic ability in a university program, those applicants with no university education will find it virtually impossible to gain admission. Over the last decade no applicants have been admitted without some university background.There is no target or quota on the number of mature candidates admitted, but there has been a steady increase in both the number and the competitiveness of mature applicants. In recent years, approximately 300 applications have been received annually. As a result the Mature category has been virtually as competitive as the General category.Required documents for mature applicants can be found in the Application Procedure section. Back to TIndigenous ApplicantsSee the Indigenous Applicants web page.Half-Time ProgramSee the Half-Time Program web page.Combined ProgramsThe Faculty of Law partners with other faculties and departments at the University of Toronto to offer a number of special combined degree programs. . Combined programs allow students to complete the JD program and one partner graduate degree program together (e.g. MA, MI, MBA, MGA, PhD). These are formal, governance-approved degree arrangements, therefore the JD can be combined with one program from a prescribed list of graduate programs only. Informal combinations are not permitted.The combination refers to being registered in the two degree programs simultaneously rather than in a single packaged program of blended courses. With the combined registration, the two degrees are completed sooner than if they were taken separately, one after the other.If the desired partner degree program has already been attained, then only the JD remains to be attained in its entirety, therefore please review the admission requirements and application procedures for the JD only. If a JD or an equivalent law degree (e.g. LLB) has already been attained, then only the partner program remains to be attained in its entirety If both programs are to be attained then review the admission requirements for each program, and apply to each program independently of the other, by each program's application process and timelines. Only if one gets admitted to each independently can one then follow the double degree registration as a combination. For applying to the JD, see the Application Procedure.For details including descriptions of the combinations offered, program duration, degree requirements and contact information for partner program admission requirements and application procedures, see the Combined Programs web page.Deferral of AdmissionsFor the policy on Deferral of Admissions, see Application Procedure.Previous ApplicantsAll applicants who have applied in previous admissions cycles who wish to re-apply, must re-apply for admission through OLSAS and re-submit supporting documents.Back to TopNotice concerning Freedom of Information and Protection of PrivacyThe University of Toronto respects your privacy.Personal information that you provide to the University is collected pursuant to section 2(14) of the University of Toronto Act, 1971.

Brendan CassidyI entered law school in my thirties after a ten year engineering and management career. Re-adjusting to student life certainly had its challenges, but the whole experience has been rewarding: intellectually, professionally, and personally. Having both a technical and business background gives me a broad and deep context to draw from in my studies, and I believe this would be true for any background. Studying law as a mature student has been a great way for me to continue to learn new things and take on new challenges.- Brendan CassidyRead other testimonials from our mature students
