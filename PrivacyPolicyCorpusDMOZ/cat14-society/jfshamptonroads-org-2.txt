Become a part of the JFS Volunteer Team!
Jewish Family Service exists today as one link in a chain of mitzvot, performed by thousands of Jews one at a time and organized together, going back to the earliest settlements in Tidewater.
Our volunteers truly exemplify the tradition of Chesed—acts of kindness, compassion and mercy toward others.
Each year, our volunteers provide thousands of hours of volunteer service to support our programs. Without their generosity of time and dedication, we would not be able to provide our full spectrum of services!!
Volunteers Needed
Meals on Wheels drivers
Thursdays between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM
Help deliver food to the home-bound and elderly! Feel proud knowing that because of your help, your neighbors are not without food!
Personal Affairs Management department
Filing help and Check Writers needed
We serve over 800 people at any given time with managing their personal affairs—and we need your help to do it! We are in need of assistance to help with clerical tasks!!
Friendly visitors are always needed
Mental health and wellness are directly correlated to socialization! Many of the people that we support are socially isolated— You can help by becoming a “friendly visitor”! These acts of Bikkur Holim (visiting and caring for those who are ill) mean all the difference in the world to someone who is alone!
Do You Knit?
Join “the knitters”! Looking for women to “exercise their fingers and their mouths” and join a wonderful group of women at the JCC every Wednesday from 10:00 AM to noon to knit for local nursing home residents. If you are unable to join them but would like to donate unworn knitted items or extra yarn, please contact JFS’ Volunteer Coordinator!
