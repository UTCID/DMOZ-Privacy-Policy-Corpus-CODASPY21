Private tuition:
Payment policy: Students must specify the amount of hours they wish to commit to and pay for them up front.  Purchased
hours must be used within 6 months of the date of purchase.
Cancellation: We require at least 24-hour notice of cancellation in writing by email to info@afbrisbane.com
and to the tutor. Students who fail to attend or to cancel 24 hours in advance will be charged the full amount. Monday classes must be
cancelled by Friday 5.00 pm or the full amount will be charged for all the hour(s) scheduled on that day.
Private classes (at Alliance, at home or on Skype) start and finish on the agreed time between tutor and student. If a student arrives late
to a private lesson, the tutor may not be able to teach longer than the initial agreed time. If a student is running late, we appreciate a
courtesy call.
We ask that parents, and not children nor teenagers, liaise with the tutor to schedule lessons.
If a student wishes to withdraw from private tuition altogether, the remaining hours are re-calculated according to their price range. The
remaining tuition fees, minus 10% administration charge, can be refunded.
The Alliance Francaise de Brisbane reserves the right to change or alter these terms and conditions anytime.
