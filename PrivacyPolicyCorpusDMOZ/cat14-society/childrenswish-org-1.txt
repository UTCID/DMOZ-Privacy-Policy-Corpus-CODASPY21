What information do we collect?
We collect information from you when you register on our site, make a financial donation, respond to a survey or fill out a web form.
Personally identifiable information collected in these surveys will not be shared. Aggregate results may be shared for analysis by third parties. The aggregate data cannot be used to identify individuals.
Donations and Fundraising Events
When you donate to Children’s Wish Foundation International – a children’s charity organization, or register for a fundraising event, we ask you to voluntarily provide your name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card number so we can process your donation or event registration, send you a receipt or confirmation and communicate with you if necessary.
If you’d like, you can provide that information another way (by phone or US postal service). When you make a gift on our site, your information goes into our database and you may then be sent emails or mailings about other opportunities to support the Children’s Wish Foundation.
You can opt-out at any time by emailing wishes@childrenswish.org or address a letter to:
