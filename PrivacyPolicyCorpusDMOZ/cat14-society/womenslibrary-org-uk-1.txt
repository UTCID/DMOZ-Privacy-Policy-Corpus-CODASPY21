GWL recognises the real and significant benefits of having a diverse and inclusive community of staff, volunteers, Board of Directors, learners, audiences and service users, and, to this end, is working towards building and maintaining an environment in which the values of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) are intrinsic to, and shared across, the organisation.GWL believes in the principles of social justice, acknowledges that discrimination affects people in complex ways and is committed to challenging all forms of inequality with an intersectional approach. The aim of this Policy is to ensure that in carrying out its activities, GWL will have due regard to promoting equality of opportunity, diversity and inclusion across the organisation, promoting good relations between people of diverse backgrounds, and eliminating unlawful discrimination.Download: GWL Equality, Diversity and Inclusion PolicyEquality, Diversity and Inclusion Action PlanThe Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan details how EDI shapes the work at Glasgow Women’s Library, looking at the period 2018 to 2021.Download: GWL Equality Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan 2018-2021Environmental PolicyWe recognise that global climate change has serious consequences, and that its detrimental effects are disproportionately experienced by women. We believe that individuals, organisations, agencies and institutions must have a clear and embedded focus on environmental issues to redress the negative impact of climate change.Our collections are built on donations, and an ethos of sharing and lending is at the heart of our work. We have always worked with an awareness of our environmental responsibilities and instil these values and working practices throughout our Board, staff and volunteer team.Our Green Creative Cluster, a team of staff, board members and volunteers, meets regularly to develop and implement innovative and creative ways to reduce our carbon footprint. We are committed to minimising waste, working towards maximum energy efficiency, and to re-using and recycling resources.We also believe that as a library, museum, archive and arts organisation, we have a role in influencing our visitors and the wider community, and we are committed to fulfilling this role through the implementation of our Environmental Policy.This policy sets out how we put this commitment into practice.Download: GWL Environmental PolicyCollections Development PolicyOur Collections Development Policy details the criteria governing future acquisitions & donations, as well as the disposal of donated materials not relevant to our collection.Download: GWL Collections Development Policy 2014GWL Intellectual Freedom StatementIntellectual Freedom and Access to Information at Glasgow Women’s Library At Glasgow Women’s Library we are committed to, and actively celebrate, freedom of thought and expression.We aim to provide books on as wide and diverse viewpoints as possible, even if they may be considered controversial or unorthodox to some.All items in the GWL collection are donated and therefore represent a broad range of interests among our tens of thousands of users and donors.Providing a wide range of information is absolutely vital to ensure that we are meeting the needs of all our library users.

We are committed to ensuring that this broad range is available for people to explore and discover for themselves.Where it is felt there are gaps in the collection, we will seek to address these within the context of continuing to build the collection based on donated materials.Access PolicyGlasgow Women’s Library is fully committed to ensuring that its premises, collections, learning programmes, range of events, projects and all other services are fully accessible to the broadest range of visitors, users and learners.This commitment is underpinned by GWL’s Core Values, Aims and Objectives, and its other policies and procedures, for example the Equality & Diversity Policy (above) and Complaints Procedures (below).GWL recognises that among its staff, volunteers, users, visitors and learners, there are people with different needs, interests, experiences, backgrounds, strengths and abilities.
