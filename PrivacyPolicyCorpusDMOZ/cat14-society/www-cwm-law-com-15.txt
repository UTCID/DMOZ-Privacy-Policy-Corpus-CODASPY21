Cybersecurity and Data Privacy
CWM’s Cybersecurity and Data Privacy practice provides a full suite of services to manage the complete life cycle of business data.  Data breaches and incidents disrupt operations, threaten critical business information, cripple key systems, compromise customer and employee personal data, exposing unprepared businesses to substantial liability and reputational damage.
CWM can help you establish the right legal policies and training programs to manage your cybersecurity risks, comply with fair information privacy practices and mitigate liability. We serve businesses of all sizes, state and municipal entities, government contractors and emerging technology companies.
CWM can also help you manage a data incident by confidentially coordinating with key stake holders to retain necessary cybersecurity forensics and insurance professionals, and by preparing notifications mandated by state and federal law. We also provide cybersecurity and data privacy c-suite consulting, employee training, privacy design consulting and privacy policy review.
