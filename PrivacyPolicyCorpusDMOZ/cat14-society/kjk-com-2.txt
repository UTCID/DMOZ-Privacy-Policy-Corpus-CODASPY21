Legal Analyst ProgramKJK is accepting applications for its Legal Analyst Program at its Columbus office. KJK’s unique two-year program offers high achieving individuals a rigorous professional experience at the crossroads of law and business prior to the pursuit of their JD or MBA degrees. Legal Analysts serve an important role in our organization—working under the supervision of attorneys to: conduct legal research and writing; draft legal correspondence, motions and briefs; interact with clients; attend court proceedings; and develop into key contributors to the KJK legal team.KJK is proud of its commitment to the long-term development and success of its Legal Analysts. Upon completion of the program, analysts possess the professional and technical skills necessary to excel in the legal industry. Our analysts have been admitted to or attended some of the nation’s most prestigious law schools including the University of Chicago, Northwestern, UCLA, George Washington University, Ohio State, and even Harvard.We are seeking ambitious recent graduates with impeccable academic records. Applicants should have at least a 3.25 GPA, strong writing and communication skills, willingness to take initiative, and a sense of drive to provide the best service for our clients. While previous legal experience is not required, ideal candidates will have academic and professional backgrounds which demonstrate their ability to critically analyze complex issues.Interested candidates should submit a cover letter and resume to Samir Dahman.“I worked as a legal analyst at KJK under Samir Dahman’s leadership for just over a year. I greatly enjoyed my time in the program, and the experience I gained as a legal analyst has already proven to be invaluable during my first year of law school. Samir and all of the attorneys of KJK personally invested much of their time and energy into helping me develop as a researcher, writer, and legal thinker. For example, I was frequently assigned complex research and writing assignments and the attorneys took the time to walk through my drafts and explain the revisions they made. My experience as a legal analyst provided a solid foundation for my first-year courses; in particular, it set me up for great success in Legal Research and Writing, a time-consuming and challenging course for many first-year law students. I am confident that much of my success in law school can be attributed to KJK’s legal analyst program. I cannot recommend the legal analyst program enough, and I cannot imagine a better way of preparing for law school.” – Raymond GansCareers Laterals Professional Staff Summer Associate Program
