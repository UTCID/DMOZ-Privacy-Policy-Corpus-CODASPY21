Use of Cookies
The Rapides Foundation Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online

server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
to a specific page. For example, if you personalize The Rapides Foundation pages, or
register with The Rapides Foundation site or services, a cookie helps The Rapides Foundation
to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
and so on. When you return to the same The Rapides Foundation Web site, the information
you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use The Rapides Foundation
features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
the interactive features of The Rapides Foundation services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
The Rapides Foundation secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. The Rapides Foundation secures the personally identifiable information
you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit

of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
