Privacy
The
Next Of Kin Registry is dedicated to protecting your
privacy.
Your information will not be sold or shared for 3rd party benefit. For privacy reasons
we do not list where this information is located. Your information
is safe guarded to protect the registrant's privacy. Contact
information is only available to Local and State Agencies working
in an official capacity, attempting to locate a next of kin
or emergency point of contact.
The NOKR will
NEVER ask for any intrusive information like your social security
number or date of birth.  NOKR does ask for age optionally which
is used as a chronological identifier.
Information collected at the Next Of Kin Registry is stored and
kept private. We understand many people have worries about
providing such information. It should be understood that the
required information collected
during registration is very
minimal.
NOKR actually
collects less information than what is currently available
in any household phonebook, which is published and distributed for free.
Your
information is stored with the Next Of Kin Registry for
emergencies only. Your information is only accessible to
agencies that have registered and must find a family member or
emergency contact to help you.
To prevent
unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place, appropriate
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
secure the information we collect online.
Security
All registrations are processed and sent via secure socket
layer (SSL) to the NOKR registry at a separate secure
location.  This secured location is User Name and Password
Protected. All data is protected under the watchful eye
of NOKR's staff.
All Internet Data Centers are strategically located on AT&T's,
Global Crossing and Cable & Wireless' OC48 / OC192 Global IP
backbones. These locations, together with the extensive
public and private peering arrangements, are designed to
maximize NOKR's Internet reach,
bandwidth capacity and to optimize performance. To ensure
all data's security,
all facilities are staffed 24
hours a day with on-site guards and equipped with both
interior and exterior closed circuit television.
Access to and from the hosting and monitoring areas is controlled
via highly secure mantraps. These single entry, hardened portals
are extremely effective at limiting access to the facility to
authorized personnel only.
The operations of all Internet Data Centers are monitored by
regional Network Operations Centers (NOC) with mirrored content
displayed in other NOCs for failsafe network system diversity and
redundancy. Network security is ensured by state-of-the-art
software and hardware for network monitoring and routing,
intrusion detection and filtering.
The NOCs are staffed on a 24/7 basis by skilled network
technicians and analysts, who continuously monitor the data center
network infrastructure for any signs of problems. Automated
features as well as customized options help network managers to
predict - and often, resolve - problems before they arise.
