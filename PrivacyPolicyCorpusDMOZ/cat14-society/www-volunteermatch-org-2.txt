mobile application ("App"). The Site and App offers the services, including but not limited to the
VolunteerMatch online volunteer matching service and various syndication services, and other information and
services related thereto (collectively, the "Services") to our users, whether they be nonprofit
organizations, volunteers, readers of our newsletters, alerts, and/or blog, registered VolunteerMatch members, or
other visitors to the Site. "You" means the individual person entering the Terms on his or her own
behalf; or, if the Terms is being entered on behalf of an organization, such as an employer, "you"
means the organization on whose behalf which this Agreement is entered, and in the latter case, the person entering
this Agreement represents and warrants that he or she has the authority to do so on your behalf.
These VolunteerMatch Terms of Service and Use set forth the legally binding terms of your access to
and use of the Site, App, and Services (the "Terms").
Please read the Terms carefully. You understand and agree that these terms set forth the legally binding terms and
conditions for your use of the Site, App, and Services, and the Site, App, and Services are made available and provided to you
under these Terms. By visiting, using or accessing Site, App, and/or the Services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the
Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you should leave the Site and discontinue use of the Site, App, and Services immediately.
If you wish to register as a VolunteerMatch member to make use of the Services reserved for members, you must read these Terms and
