Security
Our Site uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information collected through the Site, including Personal Data, is stored in a secure database that is only accessible by certain qualified representatives of GKTW. GKTW servers and vendors processing information on our behalf adhere to 2048-bit RSA transport layer encryption for transmission over the internet.
All information provided to GKTW is transmitted using TLS (Transport Layer Security), the replacement for SSL encryption (Secure Socket Layer), and our proven encryption that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of all information or transmissions.
Other Websites
Our Site contains links to other websites not operated or controlled by us. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website for which GKTW has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such websites, as their policies may be less protective than ours. Inclusion of these links to third party websites on our Site does not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the third party websites.  Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Site and welcome any feedback about these third party websites.
Children Under the Age Of 16
We do not specifically or knowingly provide or market our Site to children under the age of 16.  We do not knowingly collect or otherwise process Personal Data from children under the age of 16 without first obtaining parental or legal guardian consent. If you are under the age of 16, you may not submit any Personal Data through the Site unless and until consent is provided by your parent or legal guardian. We will take reasonable steps to verify such parental or legal guardian consent and may request additional information, including Personal Data, from such parent or legal guardian for this limited purpose. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the Site without the permission of their parent or legal guardian. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided Personal Data to us through the Site without the consent of the child’s parent or legal guardian, please contact us at dream@gktw.org, and we will delete that information from our databases.
CAN-SPAM Act
We are committed to being compliant with the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM Act”). All emails you receive from GKTW are intended to fully comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.  If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at dream@gktw.org and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
