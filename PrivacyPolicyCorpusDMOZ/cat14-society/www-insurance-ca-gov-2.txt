Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Pursuant to Civil Code 1798.3(a), personal information includes, but is not limited to, such information as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information, however, it is considered "electronically collected personal information".
According to Government Code § 11015.5, "Electronically collected personal information" means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a state agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.
The only "electronically collected personal information" we automatically collect is your domain name or Internet Protocol address. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e. completing a request for assistance, sending an e-mail or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) website.
The personal information collection and management policies, practices and procedures implemented by CDI are governed by law;including the California Information Practices Act (Civil Code section 1798 et seq., Government Code § 11015.5(a)(5), and related statutes) and the federal Privacy Act of 1974. If any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, these laws or others may protect the manner in which it is collected, used, and disclosed. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or state law.
Government Code § 11015.5 (6) prohibits CDI and all state agencies from distributing or selling, without permission of the user, any electronically collected personal information as defined above, to any third party. Any distribution of "electronically collected personal information" will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.
CDI may distribute or provide public access to certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed without the user's consent. Additionally, CDI may impose a charge for access to certain lists and statistical reports when authorized by law to do so.
This website and the information it contains are provided as a public service by the CDI. This system is monitored to ensure proper operation, to verify the functioning of applicable security features, and for comparable purposes. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring. Unauthorized attempts to modify any information stored on this system, to defeat or circumvent security features, or to utilize this system for other than its intended purposes are prohibited and may result in criminal prosecution.Back to Top
A Special Note About Children
Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians, and you should avoid providing personal information.
If CDI decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use for it. CDI will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child's information and, if they choose, prohibit the state from making further use of their child's information. CDI will not provide personal information about children to third parties.
