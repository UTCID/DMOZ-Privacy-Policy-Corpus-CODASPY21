Information Privacy Law
Maine Law has one of the top rated privacy law programs in the country.
The privacy field has exploded with opportunity. Around the world, in virtually every industry, protecting personal information has become a vital concern.  Consequently, the need for qualified, highly trained attorneys with a heightened knowledge of privacy law and policy has never been greater.
At the University of Maine School of Law, students pursuing our Certificate in Information Privacy Law develop skills in a highly sought-after niche of the legal realm.
Privacy isn’t dead – it’s hiring.
Certificate in Information Privacy Law
Maine Law is one of a few law schools in the country offering a dedicated Certificate in Information Privacy Law. Students develop valuable legal skills and benefit from a unique partnership with the IAPP.
Information Privacy Summer Institute
Our annual Information Privacy Summer Institute offers a series of courses on critical and current topics taught by top experts in the field. Existing attorneys can earn CLE credit or venture into a growing and dynamic new practice area; current J.D. candidates can develop a valuable specialty while still in school.
Greater Good Podcast
Learn more about Information Privacy, in these two Greater Good Podcast episodes which discuss the basics of privacy with Trevor Hughes, the President and CEO of the IAPP.
