Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms and any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the Website or these Terms ("Dispute") will be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all Disputes is Mercer County, New Jersey, or the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
Arbitration
In the event of any Dispute, you agree to first contact Mathematica and try to resolve the Dispute with us informally. If we haven’t been able to resolve the Dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any Dispute through binding arbitration or, with respect to Disputes that qualify for U.S. small claims court, in U.S. small claims court.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. It is important that you understand that the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us at the address at the end of these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to intellectual property or violations of these Terms.
ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH RIGHTS CANNOT EFFECTIVELY BE WAIVED OR THAT A WAIVER WOULD VIOLATE MANDATORY APPLICABLE LAW. To the extent any Dispute isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise, such Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the other sections of these Terms.
Miscellaneous
If any provision in these Terms is illegal or unenforceable, the provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and all other provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Mathematica concerning the Website and supersede any additional or prior agreements.
