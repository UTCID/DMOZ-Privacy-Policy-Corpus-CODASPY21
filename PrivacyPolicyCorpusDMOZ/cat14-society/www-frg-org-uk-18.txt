Extra help/Family Support
Sometimes parents or carers need extra help from outside agencies because they are struggling to raise their children or their children have particular needs. Children's Services are required to provide extra help for 'children in need' in their area so they should help with this. If you feel that you or your child needs extra help, read our FAQs to find how to go about getting family support services. You might also want to look at our useful links section.
Domestic Violence
If you are a mother who is involved with Children's Services because your children are (or may be) harmed by experiencing and/ or witnessing domestic violence. These FAQs may help.
If you are a practitioner working with families where domestic violence is a concern, you will find answers to some of the questions you may have in our FAQs for domestic violence practitioners.
Further information on domestic violence can be found in this section of our website.
Child Protection

Care proceedings
Children's Services may start care proceedings to remove a child from their home. They can do this if they believe that the child is suffering harm (or might suffer harm) and this is the best way to keep them safe and well cared for. This can be very upsetting for their parents and wider family. Read our FAQs to find out what happens in care proceedings and what this means for you.
Adoption
Children may be adopted because their parents or wider family aren't able to raise them long term. The adoption process can seem complicated and frightening. Read our FAQs on adoption to find out what is involved and what you can do if this has been suggested for your child.
Complaints
Social Workers work to legal standards and guidelines. If you think that these standards might have been breached in your case or if the service you got was not good enough, read our FAQs to find out how to make a formal complaint.
