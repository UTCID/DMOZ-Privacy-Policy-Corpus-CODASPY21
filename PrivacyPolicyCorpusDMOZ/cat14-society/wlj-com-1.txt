Wright Lindsey Jennings provides innovative, aggressive advocacy to defend our clients in class and collective action litigation under the various employment laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act. Our labor and employment attorneys have been involved in a wide range of complex litigation arising under both state and federal laws and understand the key legal issues that arise in these cases. We develop a sophisticated defense tailored to each case and each client’s individual needs.
Recognizing the extraordinary expense such cases pose for our clients, we work in conjunction with our paralegal and support staff to use the latest litigation support technology to reduce litigation costs and maximize efficiency, particularly in the often-difficult area of e-discovery.
We have a record of success in defeating class and collective actions, including cases in which our attorneys:
Defended a regional energy transmission company in wage and hour claims filed under the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act in state court. The court denied the plaintiff’s motion to certify a class, and the company eventually settled with the plaintiff on an individual basis.
Defended a regional mental health provider in wage and hour claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act in federal court. The court denied the plaintiff’s motion to certify a collective action.
Defended a regional oil and gas company in wage and hour claims asserting both collective and class actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act and Arkansas Minimum Wage Act. The Court denied the plaintiffs’ motions for certification of a collective action, and ultimately the plaintiff non-suited his individual wage and hour claims.
Defended a state-wide restaurant chain in wage and hour claims brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act in federal court. The Court granted summary judgment to the restaurant on the main claim related to an alleged illegal tip pool and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a collective action on the remaining side work wage and hour claims.

Employee claims present significant legal and reputation risks and can negatively impact a company’s performance. Promptly and thoroughly investigating complaints is essential. We can assist in developing appropriate processes for your company’s human resources or legal staff to follow when conducting internal investigations and provide behind-the-scenes advice. Alternatively, our attorneys can conduct the investigation, as we often do when a member of senior management is the subject of the complaint. We have developed investigation protocols designed to protect the dignity of all parties and the company’s business reputation.

Disclaimer: WLJ advises its clients on state laws regarding medical marijuana in order to facilitate compliance with those laws. Although Arkansas has decriminalized the possession, sale, and distribution of marijuana by individuals and entities that have obtained appropriate licensure from the state, the conduct decriminalized under state law remains illegal under federal law, including but not limited to the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq. Federal enforcement policy may at times defer to state law in not enforcing conflicting federal laws, but businesses and individuals should be aware that compliance with state law in no way assures compliance with federal law, and there is a risk that conflicting federal laws may change or be enforced in the future.

In today’s business world, mergers and acquisitions are common-place. But, there is more to the agreement than closing the deal. Companies must also merge the policies, benefits and personnel of two or more companies into a new one.
We take a collaborative approach when assisting our clients with this process, drawing on the experience of our Business and Labor & Employment Teams (and outside benefits and change management experts when needed) to help ensure the business goals of the merger or acquisition are not hindered by “culture” issues or legal landmines under the laws enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or any other government agency.

Increasingly, businesses rely on workplace surveillance to protect their interests and the interests of their employees. Surveillance arises out of and intersects with a variety of issues in today’s modern workplace, including the protection of trade secrets and confidential information, data security and cybersecurity, deficient employee job performance, the potential for workplace injuries, and the protection of employees from harassment and violence in the workplace. The attorneys at Wright Lindsey Jennings are well-versed in balancing the interests of businesses and the privacy rights of employees. We can help you develop workplace surveillance protocols that comply with state and federal law and can also assist with communicating those protocols to your employees, as needed.
