Purchase POLICY
1. INTRODUCTION1.1 Manchester Village Spartans RUFC (“Village Spartans, we”, “us”, “our”) is a company registered in England and Wales under company number 07032078, with registered offices at Sale Sports Club, Rookwood, Clarendon Crescent, Sale, Cheshire, M33 2DE United Kingdom.1.2 We operate an online marketplace where you can purchase tickets as well as other items in connection with events. The term “Ticket(s)” means event tickets (i.e. tickets for sale by us). The term “Resale Ticket(s)”, on the other hand, means tickets that have been purchased from us and are being sold on by the original buyer (i.e. they are not sold by us)1.3 This “Purchase Policy” sets out the terms and conditions applicable to purchases of Tickets from us. If you are making a purchase online, this Purchase Policy also incorporates our website Terms of Use.1.4 This Purchase Policy does not apply to purchases or sales of Resale Tickets.1.5 We sell Tickets and associated products and services on behalf of Village Spartans event organisers.1.6 We sell Tickets as and when they are allocated to us by Village Spartans event organisers and in accordance with their instructions. The number and type of Tickets allocated for sale by us vary on an event by event basis.1.7 We sell Tickets from several distribution points, including online (desktop, mobile website) and in some cases, in person at the Village Spartans club, at our training grounds or at Sponsor businesses such as Via Canal Street or Bar Pop, Canal Street, Manchester.  All of our distribution points access the same ticketing system and ticket inventory, therefore Tickets for popular events may sell-out quickly. Occasionally, additional Tickets for sold-out events may become available prior to events.1.8 For some events, we may sell different types of Tickets, items and packages, including:(a) “Market Tickets”: these are in-demand Tickets that are offered for sale at market-driven prices, which may be higher than the price stated on the Ticket. Market Tickets are sold on a ticket-only basis and do not include any additional products or services. Please see clause 5 below for further information on Platinum Tickets.(b) “Addons”: these are products or services that are offered for sale in addition to Tickets at a separate, additional price, such as donations or merchandise. Please see clause 13 below for further information on your rights in relation to Upsell purchases (which differ from your rights in relation to Ticket purchases).(c) “Packages”: these are packages that are offered for sale at an inclusive price, which include a Ticket and one or more additional products or services, such as exclusive seating arrangements, accommodation, transport, dining or merchandise.1.9 In this Purchase Policy, we refer to any products and services offered for sale by us (including Tickets, Market Tickets, Addons and Packages) as “Items”. Any reference to “Ticket(s)” includes Market Ticket(s) unless expressly stated otherwise.1.10 Please note, Items cannot be exchanged or refunded after purchase, save as set out in clauses 11, 12 or 13 of this Purchase Policy. If you no longer want your Tickets and are not eligible for an exchange or refund under this Purchase Policy, we suggest that, you contact us via email no later than 24th May 2019. We cannot guarantee we will be able to refund you even in exceptional circumstances.1.11 Nothing in this Purchase Policy affects your statutory rights as a consumer. For further information about your statutory rights, please contact Citizens Advice.1.12 Our Purchase Policy does not apply to any purchases made from  any other third parties. If you have any queries or complaints regarding your purchase of tickets from other third parties, please contact them directly.2.

If we discover or suspect that you have used or are using or attempting to use Village Spartans services in such a way that a criminal offence has been, is being or might be committed, we are required by law to report your identity and details of such activity to the relevant authorities (and any relevant suppliers or partners or associate companies).2.7 We reserve the right to terminate your account and/or cancel any of your orders and/or prohibit you from making future orders or using Village Spartans services in future if:(a) any abusive or threatening behaviour is carried out by you or on your behalf or via your account;(b) we suspect any fraudulent activity or other illegal activity is carried out by you or on your behalf or via your account;(c) we suspect any unauthorised use of your account or other unauthorised activity is carried out by you or on your behalf or via your account;(d) we are ordered to do so by any legal or regulatory authority; and/or(e) you otherwise breach the terms of this Purchase Policy or any other applicable policies or terms and conditions (including any applicable Event Partner’s (such as an event venue’s) terms and conditions).2.8 You may close your account by contacting us via email at pr@villagespartans.co.uk. However, please note that such closure shall not take effect until after any events that you have purchased Tickets for have taken place.2.9 Termination of your account and/or cancellations of any purchases under this Purchase Policy (or purchases, listings or sales) shall not affect our or your rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to and including the date of such termination or cancellation.3. LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT3.1 In order to make a purchase from us, you must be 18 years old or moreand able to enter into legally binding contracts. If you are purchasing online, you must also have a Manchester Village Spartans RUFC account and a valid credit or debit card issued in your name.3.2 Any purchase from us forms a legally binding contract that is subject to: (i) this Purchase Policy; (ii) any special terms and conditions stated to be applicable to an Item and/or event; (iii) other terms and conditions of the Event Partner(s) and/or event; and (iv) any venue terms and conditions (including conditions of entry). You should read this Purchase Policy carefully before you make a purchase.3.3 By purchasing one or more Items from us, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Purchase Policy. If you do not agree with this Purchase Policy or any other applicable terms and conditions, or if you cannot comply with any of them, then you must not make a purchase.3.4 We reserve the right from time to time to make changes to this Purchase Policy. Where we make any such changes, we shall post the updated version of this Purchase Policy on our website. Therefore, we recommend you check this Purchase Policy regularly to stay informed of its current terms and conditions. All purchases are subject to the applicable version of this Purchase Policy that was published at the time of purchase. If you do not agree with any revised version of this Purchase Policy, or if you cannot comply with it, then you must not make a purchase.4. PRICES, PAYMENT AND PLACING ORDERS4.1 All prices for Items offered for sale from us are inclusive of VAT and are broken down as follows:(a) sale price of the Item (“Sale Price”); plus(b) any per-Item service or facility charges (“Service Charge”); plus(c) any per-order handling and/or delivery fees (“Order Processing Fees”).4.2 Whilst we try to ensure that all advertised prices are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any Item you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of confirming your order at the correct price (in which case we will credit or debit you as applicable) or cancelling your order (in which case you will receive a full refund). If we are unable to contact you to confirm your order at the correct price, you agree that we may treat the order as cancelled and issue you with a full refund, without any further liability.4.3 In many circumstances, Ticket prices are set at the time of the initial on-sale and stay the same until the event. However, some Tickets are “market-priced,” and so Sale Prices may increase or decrease at any time, based on demand. This is similar to how airline tickets and hotel rooms are sold and is commonly referred to as “Dynamic Pricing”. You will not be entitled to a refund or credit if (i) the Sale Price you paid for a Ticket was at any time before you purchased your Ticket less than the Sale Price you paid; or (ii) the Sale Price of any other Tickets to the relevant event (whether in the same price category or otherwise) is/are subsequently reduced after you purchase your Ticket.4.4 All prices are displayed in the currency that they will be charged in, and we accept no responsibility or liability for additional charges you may be subject to by your credit or debit card provider, or any currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are entirely at your risk.4.5 We cannot offer you the ability for you to purchase “Missed Event Insurance” in relation to your Tickets, from third party providers.  Please note that purchase of such insurance is not covered by this Purchase Policy;4.6 Accepted methods of payment include Visa, MasterCard or other credit or debit cards.  Transactions will be made through the third-party, banking merchant, PayPal. By purchasing through our website you agree to their terms and conditions and privacy policies.4.7 Your contract for purchase starts once we have confirmed your order and ends immediately after completion of the event for which you have purchased Item(s). However, if you have purchased an Upsell that is a product (as opposed to a service), your contract for purchase in relation to that product will end 14 days after the date of delivery of the product to you.  Please see clause 13 for further details.4.8 If you do not receive an order confirmation after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm via your Manchester Village Spartans account or by emailing us at pr@villagespartans.co.uk whether or not your order has been placed. Only you may be aware of any problems that may occur during the purchase process. We will not be responsible for any costs or losses you incur if you assume that an order was or was not placed because you failed to receive an order confirmation.4.9 All purchases are subject to credit or debit card verification (if applicable), other security checks, and collection of payment via the third-party merchant (Payment Provider) PayPal. Your order may be cancelled if it has not passed our verification process or if payment is not received in full.  In rare circumstances, if your payment is recalled by the associated bank or payment provider, we reserve the right to cancel and refund any order for which an order confirmation has been sent.  We accept no responsibility or liability for such cancellations, as these are outside our control.4.10 It is prohibited to obtain or attempt to obtain any Items through unauthorised use of any robot, spider or other automated device or software, or through unauthorised framing or linking to any website, or through any other illegal or unauthorised activity. We reserve the right to cancel any orders that we reasonably suspect to have been made in breach of this Purchase Policy, without any notice to you, and any and all Items obtained as part of such orders will be void.4.11 To prevent fraud and protect us, we reserve the right to carry out checks and/or request that additional information be provided in order to verify purchases. We reserve the right to cancel any orders that we reasonably suspect to have been made fraudulently, without any notice to you, and any and all Items obtained as part of such orders will be void.4.12 Please ensure that you read the full Item description details and are happy with your selection prior to purchase as we may be unable to rectify issues arising as a result of your mistake.4.13 Please note, all seating maps and charts displayed during the purchase process are for guidance only and reflect the general layout for the venue for particular events. For some events, the layout and specific seat locations may vary without notice.5. MARKET TICKETS5.1 Market ticketing is our market-based pricing solution which allows us to give fans access to the most in-demand Tickets for an event, whilst enabling Event Partners to price Tickets closer to their true market value.5.2 The Sale Price of a Market Ticket at any given time represents its demand-driven market value at that time. Therefore, the Sale Price of Market Tickets vary, and may increase or decrease at any time.5.3 You pay the Sale Price of Market Tickets advertised at the time you make your purchase, but the price of equivalent or similar Market Tickets may increase or decrease before and/or after you have made your purchase. You will not be entitled to a refund or credit if you purchase a Market Ticket and the Sale Price of equivalent or similar Market Tickets subsequently falls.5.4 Please note, due to venue or system limitations, there may be either (i) no price printed on a Market Ticket, or (ii) a different price printed on the ticket to the Sale Price you paid. However, you will not be entitled to a refund or credit on the basis that you have paid a higher Sale Price for the Market Ticket.6. DELIVERY6.1 We will not dispatch any physical Tickets for events.6.2 Please allow as much time as possible for your Tickets to arrive electronically via email to the ticket purchaser only. If your Tickets have not arrived by 5 days before the event (or 5 days before you depart for the event, if earlier), or if you receive a notification of a failed delivery at any time, you should contact us via email at pr@villagespartans.co.uk for instructions (stating your name, reference number and postcode that the order is made under).6.3 For any other items purchased online through our site, that are indicated as available for physical delivery, you are responsible for providing a safe and secure delivery address and ensuring that you are available to take delivery of your items or in certain, exceptional and pre-arranged and agreed circumstances via email, your tickets (which may be delivered by any postal or courier provider). For some deliveries, a signature may be required.  Where you have paid by credit or debit card, we can only dispatch Tickets or goods purchased to the billing address of the credit or debit card used to make the purchase.  If the address in your order does not correspond to that held by your credit or debit card company, we may cancel your order.6.4 If an e-delivery option is available for goods purchased and for all ticket deliveries by email and download, you are responsible for either (i) ensuring that you log in to your Village Spartans account and download your Tickets in good time prior to the event; or (ii) providing a valid email address for e-delivery of Tickets and ensuring that you are able to receive delivery of the Tickets by email (for example by ensuring that your email mailbox does not reject, bounce or otherwise prevent any relevant emails from being delivered, and by checking your email mailbox regularly (including junk or spam folders)).6.5 Please note, all event participants (guests) under your booking must enter the event at the same time as you. In certain circumstances, print outs of pdfs of Tickets shall not be accepted for entry.6.6 We shall not be liable for, and you will not be entitled to any refund where delivery is refused, returned, missed, unclaimed or fails as a result of your failure to provide correct and complete delivery information and/or failure to ensure you are available to receive delivery of Tickets (whether physically or via email, as applicable) or your failure to download Tickets from your Village Spartans account, as applicable.6.7 Regardless of the method of delivery available at purchase, we reserve the right to make Tickets available for collection by you at the venue or at another designated ticket collection point. We will notify you by telephone or email of the arrangements for collection if this becomes necessary. You may be required to provide your booking confirmation email and your photo ID to collect Tickets, as well as the credit or debit card used to make the order.6.8 It is your responsibility to check your Tickets immediately once they have been delivered as mistakes cannot always be rectified. You should contact us by email at pr@villagespartans.co.uk immediately if there is a mistake or error with your Tickets or if you do not receive your Tickets as ordered and/or as described in your order confirmation. We may not be able to assist you if you do not inform us of any errors that are reasonably obvious from inspection of your Tickets within 5 days of receipt (and/or in good time prior to the event date).6.9 Please note, we are responsible for delivery of Tickets to you. Most products and/or services sold as an Addon and non-Ticket elements of a Package are produced and fulfilled by the relevant Event Partner (e.g. The Midland Hotel for the 20th Anniversary Gala on 23rd August 2019) who is responsible for the delivery and quality of such products and/or services. We accept no responsibility or liability for the delivery or quality of any such products and/or services except and to the extent that they are produced and/or fulfilled directly by us. Merchandise (e.g. Polo Shirts, Programmes and other Village Spartans branded items) sold as part of an Addon and non-Ticket elements of a Package are produced by Manchester Village Spartans. Please contact us if you have any queries by email at pr@villagespartans.co.uk. If you have any queries or complaints regarding any Addon and/or any non-Ticket elements of a Package, please contact the relevant Event Partner directly (or contact us contact us by email at pr@villagespartans.co.uk and we can put you in touch with the relevant Event Partner or deal with your complaint accordingly).7. TICKET TRANSFER7.1 We offer “Ticket Transfer” functionality in respect of many events. You can use Ticket Transfer, where available, to transfer Tickets you have purchased to your friends and family by emailing us with details of the requested transfers and all the relevant ticket information that will help us identify your purchase/s.7.2 Ticket Transfer is intended to be used for transferring Tickets to friends and family; you should only transfer Tickets to people that you know and trust.7.3 By using Ticket Transfer to transfer a Ticket you have purchased (or that you have been transferred by someone else using Ticket Transfer), you are only facilitating another person using that Ticket; the contract (and associated rights and obligations) for the purchase of that Ticket remains between us and you (or the original purchaser as the case may be), regardless of the number of times the Ticket is transferred using Ticket Transfer. However, all terms and conditions applicable to the use of a Ticket shall remain applicable to such Ticket, regardless of the number of times the Ticket is transferred using Ticket Transfer.7.4 Ticket Transfer can only be used for Tickets and not for Addons purchased with Tickets or any non-Ticket elements of Packages.7.5 We may cancel any transferred Tickets if we have grounds to suspect that they were obtained fraudulently, unlawfully or otherwise in violation of this clause 7, or any other provisions of this Purchase Policy or any other applicable terms and conditions.7.6 You can cancel a Ticket Transfer invitation but only if you do so before the recipient accepts your Ticket Transfer invitation.7.7 IMPORTANT: Once a recipient accepts your Ticket Transfer invitation you will not be able to (i) use your original Ticket for event entry; (ii) cancel or otherwise get the transferred Ticket back (because the recipient will get a new Ticket with a new barcode); If a Ticket is transferred multiple times using Ticket Transfer, only the Ticket from the most recent Ticket Transfer will be valid for entry; all previous Ticket barcodes will be cancelled.7.8 If an event is cancelled, rescheduled or materially altered, only the original purchaser of a transferred Ticket will be entitled to any refund or credit available under clause 11. We will only deal with the original purchaser of a transferred Ticket in respect of all matters relating to the Ticket and the event for which it is issued. It is the responsibility of the original purchaser of a Ticket to keep all the recipients of any transferred Tickets updated with any information we provide to the original purchaser.7.9 To the maximum extent permitted by law, any liability we may have in connection with a Ticket will only be owed to the original purchaser of the Ticket, and not to any recipient to whom that Ticket may have been transferred (whether using Ticket Transfer or otherwise).8. TICKET RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS8.1 Any Ticket you purchase from us remains the property of Manchester Village Spartans RUFC and is a personal revocable licence which may be withdrawn, and admission refused, at any time by us or the Event Partner. If this occurs without any fault or act or omission on your part, you will be refunded (or partially refunded) for the Ticket which has been withdrawn or for which access was refused (including the relevant Sale Price and Service Charge but excluding any Order Processing Fees).8.2 When you receive or collect your Tickets, please keep them in a safe place or save any electronic tickets securely. We will not be responsible for any Tickets that are lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed following receipt or collection by you.  We strongly recommend that you do not post pictures or details of your Tickets online as this may allow third parties to counterfeit your Tickets or otherwise compromise the integrity of the Tickets and we will not be liable if you are refused entry to the event as a result.8.3 You acknowledge that lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed Tickets may not be able to be replaced where policies set by an Event Partner prohibit us from issuing replacement Tickets (e.g., for general admission events where there is a possibility that both original and any replacement tickets may be used to gain entry, which may compromise the licensed capacity of the venue). If we are able to issue replacement Tickets, we may charge you a reasonable administration fee.8.4 Where your Tickets are for allocated seats, you have a right only to seats of a value corresponding to that stated on the Ticket. We or the relevant Event Partner or venue reserve the right (whether before or during the event) to provide alternative seats to those initially allocated to you or specified on the Tickets.9. TICKET RESTRICTIONS9.1 When purchasing Tickets from us, you are sometimes limited to a specified number of Tickets for each event. This number may included on the first purchase page and is verified with every order. This policy is in effect to discourage and prevent unfair ticket buying practices. Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number per person (or business, as applicable), per credit or debit card and, for some events or ticket types, a restriction may apply per household as well. We reserve the right to cancel any order(s) for Tickets purchased in excess of the relevant limits without notice.9.2 Tickets may be sold subject to certain restrictions on entry or use, such as restricted, obstructed or side view or a minimum age for entry. Any such restrictions will be displayed or otherwise notified to you before or at the time of booking. It is your responsibility to ensure that you read all notifications and other important information displayed or notified to you as part of the purchase process. We will not be responsible if you or any guests under your booking are refused admission because of a failure to meet or prove that you/they meet any restrictions (e.g. a minimum age requirement).9.3 You may not resell or transfer your Tickets if prohibited by law. In addition, Event Partners may restrict or prohibit the resale or transfer of tickets for some events. Any resale or transfer (or attempted resale or transfer) of a ticket in breach of the applicable law or any restrictions or prohibition imposed by an Event Partner is grounds for seizure or cancellation of that Ticket.9.4 Tickets purchased from us may not:(a) be used for advertising, promotions, contests or sweepstakes (or for other such similar commercial gain); and/or(b) be combined with any hospitality, travel or accommodation service and/or any other merchandise, product or service to create a package for sale or other distribution, unless formal written permission is given by us and the relevant Event Partner in advance and provided that even if such permission is granted, use of our or any Event Partner’s trade marks and other intellectual property is subject to the express prior written consent of the owner.10. EVENT TIMINGS AND ADMISSIONS10.1 Please note that advertised start times of events are subject to change. Also, check-in and closing times stated in relation to an event are not indicative of the event’s start or end time (or when an artist is scheduled to play or the length of the artist’s performance), all of which remain at the relevant Event Partner’s and/or artist’s discretion and may be subject to change.10.2 Tickets are sold subject to the Village Spartans and / or the Event Partner’s right to alter or vary the programme of an event due to events or circumstances beyond its reasonable control without being obliged to refund monies or exchange tickets, unless such change is a material alteration as described in clause 11, in which case the provisions of that clause shall apply.10.3 Generally, every effort to admit latecomers will be made at a suitable break in the event, but admission cannot always be guaranteed.10.4 The event venue may conduct security searches of you and other patrons for safety and security purposes and/or may refuse admission to patrons (including you) breaching or suspected of breaching any terms and conditions of the event or any Event Partner.10.5 Admission to all events is subject to the terms of admission of the relevant venue, and certain items (e.g. laser pens, mobile phones, dogs (except guide dogs) and patrons’ own food and drink) may be prohibited. Please check with the venue directly.  The unauthorised use of photographic and/or recording equipment at events may also prohibited. Any unauthorised photos, videos and/or recordings may be destroyed or deleted.10.6 Breach of any of venue terms and conditions or any unacceptable behaviour likely to cause damage, nuisance or injury shall entitle the Event Partner to eject you from the venue.10.7 Event Partners reserve the right to refuse admission to the venue, or to remove any person from the venue for reasons of public safety (including crowd surfing or moshing), any unacceptable behaviour likely to cause damage, nuisance or injury, or for any breach of the Event Partners´ terms and conditions.10.8 Unless expressly authorised by the relevant Event Partner, there will be no pass-outs or re-admissions of any kind.10.9 By attending an event, you and other patrons consent to being photographed, filmed and/or recorded and may be featured as members of the audience in any resulting photographs, footage or recordings.10.10 Prolonged exposure to loud music or noise may damage your hearing and we advise you and all patrons to wear adequate ear protection at events.10.11 Special effects, which may include sound, audio-visual, pyrotechnic effects or lighting effects may be featured at an event, which may not be suitable for those with photosensitive epilepsy, or similar conditions.11. EVENT CANCELLATIONS AND ALTERATIONS11.1 If an event is cancelled, rescheduled or materially altered, we will use reasonable endeavours to notify you once we have received the relevant information and authorisation from our Event Partner (if you book online, we will use your account details). However, we cannot guarantee that you will be informed of such cancellation, rescheduling or alteration before the date of the event. It is your responsibility to ascertain whether an event has been cancelled, rescheduled or altered and the date and time of any rescheduled event.11.2 Cancellation: If an event for which you have purchased Tickets or Packages is cancelled in full (and not rescheduled), your order will be cancelled, and you will be refunded the Sale Price of your Tickets or Packages, plus the relevant Service Charges. Your Order Processing Fees will not be refunded if your Tickets or Packages have already been dispatched or delivered to you.  If you have purchased Tickets or Packages for an event takes place over several days and one or more days (but not all days) are cancelled, you may only be offered a proportionate partial refund.11.3 Rescheduling: If an event for which you have purchased Tickets or Packages is rescheduled, Tickets and Packages will usually be valid for the new date (or you will be offered Tickets or Packages of a value corresponding with your original Tickets or Packages for the rescheduled event, subject to availability). If you notify us within the specified deadline that you are unable to attend the rescheduled event, you will be able to cancel your order and obtain a refund of the Sale Price of your Tickets or Packages plus the relevant Service Charges. Your Order Processing Fees will not be refunded if your Tickets or Packages have already been dispatched or delivered to you.  Failure to notify us within any specified deadline that you are unable to attend the rescheduled event will be deemed to be a reconfirmation of your order for Tickets or Packages for the rescheduled event, and you will not be able to claim a refund.11.4 Material Alteration: If an event for which you have purchased Tickets or Packages is “materially altered” (as defined in clause 11.5 below), Tickets and Packages will usually be valid for the altered event (or you will be offered Tickets or Packages of a value corresponding with your original Tickets or Packages for the altered event, subject to availability). If you notify us within the specified deadline that you do not wish to attend the altered event, you will be able to cancel your order and obtain a refund of the Sale Price of your Tickets or Packages plus the relevant Service Charges.  Your Order Processing Fees will not be refunded if your Tickets or Packages have already been dispatched or delivered to you.  Failure to notify us within any specified deadline that you do not wish to attend the altered event will be deemed to be a reconfirmation of your order for Tickets or Packages for the altered event, and you will not be able to claim a refund.11.5 For the purposes of this Purchase Policy, a “material alteration” is a change (other than a rescheduling) which, in our and the relevant Event Partner’s reasonable opinion, makes the event materially different to the event that purchasers of Tickets, taken generally, could reasonably expect. In particular, please note that the following are not deemed to be “material alterations”: the use of understudies in theatre performances; adverse weather conditions; changes of any supporting act; changes to individual members of a band; changes to the line-up of any multi-performer event (such as a gala); changes to or failure of the advertised after-dinner speaker to perform at the event or a reduction in estimated duration of the after-dinner speakers performance; curtailment of the event where the majority of an event is performed in full; and delays to the starting of the performance of an event.11.6 To claim a refund under clause 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4, please follow the instructions we provide to you or apply in writing to: Event Ticket Services, Manchester Village Spartans RUFC, Sale Sports Club, Clarendon Crescent, Sale, Cheshire M33 2DE (or such other address as notified to you by us). Where we instruct you to do so, you must enclose or return to us your unused Tickets and comply with any other instructions from us. For accounting purposes in relation to cancelled events, your unused Tickets must be received by us within 28 days from the date of the cancelled event. Please note, if you sell any Tickets to a third person, any payments you have received pursuant to such sale will be taken into account in relation to any refunds you may be entitled to under this Purchase Policy.11.7 Refunds will be made using the same means of payment as you used for the initial purchase.11.8 If you have purchased any Addons associated with an event which has been cancelled, rescheduled or materially altered and a refund in relation to the Tickets is due to you in accordance with clause 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4, unless the Addon is a product and has already been delivered to you or is a digital download purchased during the 14 days immediately before the date of release or at any time on or after the release date, we will also refund you the Sale Price and Service Charge of such Addons purchased from us. However, nothing in this clause 11 shall operate to exclude your statutory right to cancel orders for Addons other than Excluded Addons (as defined below), as set out in clause 13.12.
