Your Privacy Is Our Priority

Privacy Notice
Privacy: Concordia Publishing House respects and wants to protect the privacy of our users. We do not collect your name or email address, unless you provide it on a registration form, order form, survey form, or send us an email.  Our site's forms may ask or require you to give us contact information (like your email address), financial information (like your account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like your zip code). We use this information to provide information, products, or services that you request. For example, financial information is used to bill you for products and services that you order. Any information collected is for internal use and is not made available to any outside company or organization except in the performance of our responsibilities to you as our customer (i.e. credit card numbers are used to process transactions with third party financial institutions). We share customer information only with organizations that are acting on our behalf to conduct specific activities, such as our auditors. We do not sell the names and addresses of our customers.
Use and Collection of Information: We collect aggregate data (for example how many times a certain page is visited). We may also record search terms used to refine our search engine.  We only collect personally identifiable information (like your name) when you create an account with us, submit a form, place an order, or contact us and provide this information.
