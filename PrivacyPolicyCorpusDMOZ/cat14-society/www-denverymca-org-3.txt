MEMBERSHIP AND PARTICIPANT POLICIES AND CODE OF CONDUCT
CODE OF CONDUCT
Members and guests of the YMCA of Metropolitan Denver (“Denver YMCA”) agree to abide by the following rules, policies, and code of conduct, as updated from time to time on Denver YMCA’s website (www.denverymca.org), including changes approved by its governing bodies in accordance with its Charter and By-Laws. Members and guests are expected to behave in a mature and responsible way and to respect the rights and dignity of others. Parents and guardians are responsible for the actions of their minor children and wards. Denver YMCA does not permit language or any action that would tend to hurt or intimidate another person, including staff, or that falls below a generally accepted standard of conduct. All members and guests must be able to present valid photo identification when present at or using Denver YMCA’s premises and all facilities and equipment thereon (collectively, the “Premises”) and participating in Denver YMCA’s programs and services (collectively, the “Activities”). Membership cards are not transferable, remain the property of Denver YMCA, and must be returned upon request. Members must be 18 years old to enroll in Denver YMCA without a parent authorizing the application.
Each member parent and guardian pledges to provide positive support, care, and encouragement for his or her child and for all other children participating in youth programs by following the following Parent’s Code of Conduct:
I will encourage good sportsmanship by creating a positive sports environment for all players, coaches, and officials at every game, practice, or other youth sport event.
I will place the emotional and physical well-being of my child ahead of my personal desire to win.
I will insist that my child play in a safe and healthy environment.
I will remember that the game is for the youth, not adults, and will do my best to make youth sports fun for my child.
I will ask my child to treat other players, coaches, fans, and officials with respect regardless of race, sex, creed, or ability.
I will help my child enjoy the youth sports experience by doing whatever I can, such as being a respectful fan and assisting with coaching.
DENVER YMCA POLICIES

In the event of an accident, injury, or incident, members and guests should contact a staff member immediately. First-aid kits are available at the Premises, along with automated external defibrillators.

Proper dress for a family-friendly facility is expected at all times. Shirts, bottoms, and shoes are to be worn at all times, except in the pool and locker-room areas. Clothing with offensive, vulgar, or profane writing or pictures is not allowed. Athletic shoes (without black soles), shirts, and shorts are appropriate for gym and work-out areas.
Cell Phones and Cameras
Phone calls should be made only in designated areas, and use of electronics should not disrupt others. Use of cameras is prohibited in locker rooms, restrooms, changing areas, and showers. When otherwise using a camera or other recording device, members and guests must be respectful of the privacy of others.

Drug, Tobacco, and Alcohol Free
The use of alcohol, tobacco, vaping, and illegal and recreational drugs, including but not limited to marijuana, is prohibited on the Premises. Members or guests under the influence of alcohol or illegal or recreational drugs are not permitted on the Premises.
Food and Beverages
Food and beverages can be enjoyed only in designated areas at each of the Premises.
Guests
Denver YMCA encourages members to introduce their friends and family to Denver YMCA. All guests are required to abide by Denver YMCA terms, conditions, rules, policies, and procedures; sign a Denver YMCA Release Agreement (“Release”); and present valid photo identification. Guest privileges do not include fee-based program access, and Denver YMCA (including the Wellness Centers specifically) may suspend or limit the use of guest passes during peak periods. Members (ages 13 and over only) may bring guests up to three times at no charge, but members who are under 18 years of age cannot bring in another minor as a guest without the minor-guest’s legal guardian or parent present. After three visits, guests must join Denver YMCA or pay a day-pass fee. If guests are under 18 years of age, their legal guardian or parent must sign the Release. Denver YMCA reserves the right to perform background checks on its guests through sex-offender-screening services. Registered sex offenders and individuals with any criminal conviction for an act that is contrary to Denver YMCA values and mission may not be eligible to access Denver YMCA Premises.
Hygiene
Members and guests must shower before entering pools and may shave only in the shower or sink area.
Locker Room Key and Lock Rental
Members and guests are encouraged to lock up their belongings while at the Premises. To rent a key or lock for a Denver YMCA locker, members and guests should present valid proof of membership or guest admission to the front desk. There is a penalty for lost keys or locks.
Lost or Stolen Property
Denver YMCA is not liable for items lost or stolen on the Premises or during Activities. Members and guests are responsible for their own possessions. Valuables should be left at home.
Lost and Found
Items that are found and turned in are kept at the front desk at each of the Premises. Articles unclaimed after 7 days are donated to charity.
Photograph and Talent Release
Denver YMCA may photograph or record Activities involving members and guests for documentation or promotion. Members and guests authorize Denver YMCA to use any photos, videos, or audio recordings of them and their family, without any compensation from Denver YMCA for these images.
Safety
Denver YMCA is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for every member and guest. To promote safety and comfort for all, individuals must act appropriately at all times when on the Premises or participating in Activities. The following policies promote safety:
Use of Caution. Members and guests should exercise caution when participating in classes, using equipment, and swimming. Members and guests must use protective equipment where recommended and must supervise their minor children.
Security Cameras. To protect members, guests, staff, and volunteers, certain areas are under video surveillance.
Sexual Offender Background Check Policy. Providing a safe and threat-free environment is of great importance to Denver YMCA. For this reason, Denver YMCA monitors the sexual offender registry. Persons on the list will not be eligible for Denver YMCA membership, guest privileges, Activities participation, or volunteer or employment opportunities. Denver YMCA reserves the right to deny Premises access, membership, or Activities participation to any person who has been charged with or convicted of any crime for an act that is contrary to Denver YMCA values and mission or who is required by law to register as a sex offender. Denver YMCA reserves the right to perform background checks on its members and guests and to periodically review sex offender lists. And members and guests consent to a sexual offender background check.
Weapons and Violence. Possession, sale, distribution, and carrying of weapons, including guns, knives, and explosives, at the Premises is prohibited and will result in immediate dismissal from the Premises and possible cancellation of membership or participation in Activities. Violent acts by any member, in whatever form, will not be tolerated and may result in cancellation of membership or Activities participation.
Payment Terms
Membership: Each member agrees to pay for membership either 1) in full in one payment for annual membership or 2) monthly/quarterly via either corresponding drafts on a bank account designated during registration or corresponding charges to a credit card designated during registration; and each member hereby authorizes Denver YMCA to make such drafts or charges. Each member understands that any automatic membership payments will continue until the member provides a 5-day, advance notice to cancel the charges (cancellations can be made here). When the bank or credit card company charges the member’s account, such charges constitute the receipt for payment. In the event that any charge is returned unpaid, it will be collected electronically and the member’s account will also be assessed a collection service charge of the lesser of $ 25.00 or the maximum amount allowed by law, and the member will be responsible for any other associated collection costs. Automatic payments will be processed by Denver YMCA on the 1st or the 15th day (based on the day of selection during registration) of each month or the next banking day thereafter. If any changes need to be made to a member’s account, whether adding or deleting members, placing an account on hold, or changing bank account or credit card information, all requests must be submitted in person at least five business days before the scheduled payment to the Denver YMCA facility where membership was purchased. If a member wishes to add additional members to his or her account, proof of residency of the additional member is required. Family memberships are eligible for no more than one additional adult member over the age of 24 years old. An additional monthly flat fee will be applied to the member's account for this adult add on to the membership.
Activities: Payment for Activities registrations is due at the time of registration, unless otherwise specified for the Activity. If the Activities fee has not been paid, the Activities registration will be cancelled. Financial assistance is available for those who qualify. In the event that any charge is returned unpaid, it will be collected electronically and the member’s account will also be assessed a collection service charge of the lesser of $ 25.00 or the maximum amount allowed by law, and the member will be responsible for any other associated collection costs.
Termination of Membership
Membership in Denver YMCA is renewed indefinitely until 1) a member provides in-person notice of cancellation at least 5 days prior to the termination date, or 2) Denver YMCA cancels the membership. Members can request to end their membership at any time by filling out a this cancellation form. The notice must be submitted at least 5 days prior to the termination date, regardless of the manner of payment. Members who pay by automatic draft must submit the cancellation request at least 5 days before the scheduled draft to ensure cancellation is effective by that draft (25th of the month for those that draft on the 1st and 10th of the month for those that draft on 15th). Frequency of use of the Premises is at the discretion of the member, and refunds are not available for lack of use.
Refund policy
All membership payments are non-refundable. Activities fees can be refunded (minus a $15 service fee) only if a refund is requested five business days or more before the Activity starts. Activities cancelled by Denver YMCA will receive a full refund. There are no cash refunds.
Nationwide Membership
Members of Denver YMCA participate in the YMCA Nationwide Membership Program. Members agree to release the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations of the United States of America, and its independent and autonomous member associations in the United States and Puerto Rico, from claims of negligence for bodily injury or death in connection with the use of YMCA facilities and from any liability for other claims, including loss of property, to the fullest extent of the law.
