Our online donations are processed through a third-party service, Blackbaud, Inc., which is a VeriSign-authorized vendor. You will be asked to provide your name, contact information and credit card billing information. All of this information is encrypted using industry-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology, as is all information on our website.
All personal information gathered by GP is stored on our server, and access is controlled via Active Directory security so that only authorized users are allowed access to various directories and files. The GP network is protected by a firewall that controls all access to the network. All users of any level are issued a user name and complex password for their access to the network on our server.
