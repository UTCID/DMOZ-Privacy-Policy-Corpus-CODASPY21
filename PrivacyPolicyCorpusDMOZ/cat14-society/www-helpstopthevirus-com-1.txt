We now know what it takes to help stop the virus.
In our bodies. In our communities. It takes all of us.

Here's the story on
STOPPING THE VIRUS
(Starring Testing, Prevention, and Treatment)
EVERYONE SHOULD GET TESTED
Today's guidelines say everyone, from ages 13-64, should get tested at least once. Some should be tested more often.
In the U.S., for every 7 people withHIV, one person does not know it.
IF YOU DON’T HAVE HIV
you can stay that way.
Use condoms and practice safer sex
Ask a healthcare provider about all the ways to prevent HIV
Talk to your partners about their test results
Never share needles
Get retested regularly
IF YOU DO HAVE HIV
you can take care of your health.
Talk to a healthcare
provider about HIV
treatment soon.
TREATMENT CAN HELP STOP THE VIRUS IN YOUR BODY
That can help reduce the damage HIV causes. There is no
cure for HIV, but starting treatment as soon as possible
gives you a better chance of living a longer and healthier
life. Ask a healthcare provider all about it.
BY STAYING ON TREATMENT
the amount of virus in your blood can get so low,
it can't be measured by a test. So low it's undetectable.
Current research shows that sticking to treatment and staying undetectable means
there's basically no risk of transmitting HIV through sex.
You can help protect your health, help protect the people you care about, and help
STOP THE VIRUS IN THE COMMUNITY.
