The 2020 election is shaping up to be historic on a number of fronts, potentially resulting in a change of control in the White House, Congress, or both.
Among the issues at stake for employers is whether, how, and/or to what degree the outcome of the election will impact workplace law, policy, and regulation.
Please join us for an enlightening discussion featuring two of the nation's leading experts in federal labor policy and government relations, Josh Ulman and Jennifer Ortega of Ulman Public Policy and Federal Relations, and moderated by Carlton Fields Shareholder Rae Vann.
The panelists will preview what employers might expect from a second Trump term or a new Biden administration regarding:
Possible post-election executive action
New regulatory or de-regulatory mandates from the EEOC, DOL, and NLRB, including pay data collection requirements, joint employer obligations, and union organizing rules
New federal contractor compliance obligations, such as revival of the Clinton-era "blacklisting" rules
Changes to the Senate filibuster and other congressional rules affecting the legislative process and more
