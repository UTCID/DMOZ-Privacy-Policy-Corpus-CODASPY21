GRAMA request for release of video footage of Abdi Mohamed shooting by SLCPD
12 May 2016
Published in
Legal Advocacy
On May 12, 2016, The ACLU of Utah and First Amendment attorney David Reymann of Parr Brown Gee & Loveless submitted an official request that video footage of the shooting of Abdi Mohamed by the Salt Lake City Police Department (SLCPD) be released to the public under Utah’s Government Records Access & Management Act (GRAMA). In mid-June, 2016, after several weeks of discussion with the Salt Lake County District Attorney's office to clarify aspects of our information request, the ACLU of Utah received an official notification that some, but not all, of the information requested would be provided under GRAMA. You can read more here about what information was released at that time. Most pertinently, officer body camera footage of the shooting incident was not released, nor was footage from security cameras in the area. On July 7, 2016, we filed our official appeal regarding the information that was not made public. The ACLU of Utah and cooperating attorney David Reymann of Parr Brown Gee & Loveless maintain our stance that all information about this critical incident, which has generated strong public interest and concern, should be released as requested.

Utah: Only State in Nation to Enforce English-Only Policy in Prisons? Thanks to the ACLU of Utah, Not Anymore
15 July 2013
Published in
Legal Advocacy
Utah, formerly the only state to enforce English-only policies in prisons for inmates and their visitors, no longer stands out as a bastion of bad policy. We are thrilled to report to our members and supporters that Rollin Cook, Executive Director of Utah State Corrections, withdrew the decades-old English-only policy after we informed him that the policy violated prisoners’ Constitutional rights, and that the policy was outdated and poorly tailored to guarantee the safety of inmates, their visitors, and staff.

ACLU of Utah Urges Utah State Board Of Education To Protect Privacy Of Students Taking Military Entrance Exam
19 July 2012
Published in
Legal Advocacy
Yesterday, the ACLU of Utah sent a letter to State Superintendent of schools Larry Shumway raising grave concerns about the privacy implications of Utah public high schools’ use of the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery test, also known as the ASVAB. The ASVAB, promoted as a voluntary “Career Exploration Program,” is a recruiting tool used by the U.S. military. According to the National Coalition to Protect Student Privacy, in the 2009-10 school year, 8,365 Utah high school students took the ASVAB. The national group estimates that about 90% of those students’ results and information were provided to the U.S. military without the consent of their parents. Parental consent was not sought because schools, not students or parents, select the level of privacy afforded to ASVAB testing information.

Salt Lake City Overreacts By Shutting Down Occupy SLC Encampment
16 November 2011
Published in
Legal Advocacy
On Saturday, November 12, Salt Lake City Police joined by Salt Lake County Sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies, forcibly evicted over 100 people from their 38 day encampment at Pioneer Park. The eviction followed the tragic death of a homeless camper in his tent whose body was discovered on Friday, November 11. The ACLU of Utah had been working closely with both Salt Lake City and the Occupy movement to ensure that the 1st Amendment rights of the protestors were protected, and believes that the City had alternative means of addressing its concerns. While recognizing the city's responsibility to respond to health and safety concerns, we were disheartened by the city's unnecessary crackdown onthe Occupiers whose overnight encampment was a fundamental aspect of its expressive message. In a letter to Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, the ACLU of Utah expressed disappointment in the City's actions and requested a meeting to discuss the event and how to allow meaningful avenues for SLC Occupiers to continue their campaign. Last night, the ACLU joined occupiers at the City Council to further express its concerns and its hope that Salt Lake City will once again promote First Amendment activity instead…

Proposed Sale of Manti Street Raises Significant First Amendment Concerns

Published in
Legal Advocacy
After receiving numerous complaints regarding the proposed sale of a Manti city street to the LDS Church, the ACLU of Utah sent a letter on August 18 to the Manti City Council, which was set to make a decision at their meeting that night. The street has traditionally been used as a public thoroughfare and public forum for people of all religious and political persuasions, particularly during the annual week-long Mormon Miracle Pageant held in Manti. The ACLU letter discussed the important First Amendment rights that would be threatened if the street were to be sold to a private entity, and the lack of public knowledge or involvement prior to the city council meeting.
