Privacy Policy
All questions, comments and requests concerning the present
document should be emailed to the CanLII Editor using
the feedback form.
Information on website users
Information in documents published by CanLII
1. CanLII avoids collecting and storing personal information and,
if personal information on users is received, CanLII treats it with utmost
confidentiality. CanLII complies with applicable Canadian legislation on
privacy protection.
2. CanLII adheres to the principle of openness and transparency
of legislative and judicial processes, and recognizes their fundamental
importance in democratic societies. In order to minimize the negative impact
of such transparency on the privacy of those involved in cases leading to
judicial decisions, CanLII does not permit its case law collections to be
indexed by external search engines.
Information on Website Users
3.	CanLII does not gather personal information on site users. When a user
contacts CanLII, personal information may be conveyed at the user’s
discretion. CanLII considers such information to be confidential. Personal
information on users that comes into CanLII’s possession is destroyed or
erased as soon as CanLII no longer requires it for the purposes for which
it was provided.
4.	CanLII gathers information on the use of its services for the sole
purpose of keeping statistics on visits and ensuring smooth operation of its
website’s services. CanLII does not attempt to identify users, and
information gathered is never used to establish user profiles. Moreover,
information gathered is never disclosed to third parties, unless such
disclosure is required by law or needed to prevent misuse or unauthorized
use of services offered by CanLII.
Data on Visits
5.	When a user accesses a website, various pieces of information circulate
between the user’s computer and the website’s server. CanLII stores the
transactional information related to user computers. The information
consists in:
The IP address and corresponding domain name, if available;
The operating system and web browser employed;
The address of the referring site, if the user reached CanLII from another site;
The query on the search engine of the referring site, if applicable;
The pages visited on CanLII;
The date, time and duration of the visit;
The queries made on CanLII’s search engine.
6.	CanLII gathers this information in order to track the number
of visitors, pages most often visited, technology used by users, referring
sites and users’ countries of origin. Analysis of this data enables CanLII
to improve its site, develop new services and prevent misuse of its
resources.
Cookies
7.	A cookie is saved on the user computer’s hard disk in order to record
the choice of language made when CanLII is visited for the first time. The
cookie expires 30 days after the last use of CanLII. It is also possible to
erase it at any time by clicking
here.
Users can also refuse cookies by
changing their preferences in their web browser. Since cookies are not
necessary to use CanLII, users who refuse cookies can navigate CanLII web
pages freely and without any problem.
Feedback Form
8.	When users complete the feedback form, it is possible for them to
provide their names, organization’s name and email address. The information
is used and stored only as required to process the request and to establish
general statistics.
Mailing List
9.	Users who subscribe to CanLII mailing lists must provide valid email
addresses, and may provide their names, at their discretion. The information
is gathered uniquely for the purposes of managing and operating the list, and
is destroyed when the subscriber terminates the subscription. Users always
have access to their accounts and can correct information and terminate
subscriptions themselves.
Management of Information Gathered by CanLII
10. In order to ensure compliance with the present policy and applicable
legislation on privacy protection, an officer is appointed to see to respect
for the principles stated here and legislation applicable to protection of
personal information on users. The Privacy Policy Officer can be contacted
using the feedback form.
11.	All information gathered by CanLII is kept in a secure computer
environment to which access is restricted. CanLII employees who gather,
store and use personal information are required to ensure that their
activities comply with the present policy. CanLII makes a commitment to
maintain a high degree of security.
Information in Documents Published by CanLII
12.	CanLII publishes documents in the form in which they are received
from the institutions that issue them, such as official publishers, courts
and law societies. The documents are public. CanLII considers that publishing
the complete documents, including the personal information they may contain,
is primordial to implementing the principles of openness and transparency
that govern Canadian public institutions.
13.	With respect to court decisions, the transparency characteristic of
the Canadian judicial system protects the impartiality of the judiciary,
ensures the fairness of the judicial process and enables individuals to
base their conduct on precedents established by judges. CanLII does not
edit the content of court decisions except to comply with publication bans
imposed by statutes or courts and in accordance with the policies of the
institution that provided the text of the decision.
14.	In order to limit prejudice to individuals that could result from
free publication of documents containing personal information, CanLII is
actively involved in advancing standards and policies that promote optimal
protection of the privacy of people who appear before the courts.
Indexing of Decisions by External Search Engines
15.	Through application of
recognized
web robot exclusion protocols and
by restricting indexing activities in its terms of use,
CanLII prohibits external search engines from indexing the text and case name of decisions published on its website, except for Supreme Court of Canada decisions. When indexing prohibitions in robot
exclusion protocols are complied with, searching for the name of an individual
using an Internet search engine does not return decisions published on CanLII.
However, when a third party links to a CanLII decision on a web page that is
not under CanLII’s control, names that are included in this page or in the link’s
text might still be indexed by external search engines. Neither CanLII nor its
partners represent or guarantee that the technological and legal measures taken
to prevent external indexing will be respected or be free of mistakes or malfunctions.
Requests Concerning the Content of Published Documents
16.	All requests concerning the content of a document published on the
CanLII website should be submitted to CanLII’s Editor or Privacy Policy
Officer using the feedback form.
If the request is to withdraw or amend a
decision, it will be studied in light of applicable rules pertaining to
publication restrictions. Requests for withdrawal or amendment that are not
justified by relevant legislative provisions or a court order restricting
publication will be refused. Persons wishing to submit a request for
withdrawal but who do not know the law applicable to their situation are
asked to contact their lawyer or the registry of the court that rendered
the decision.
