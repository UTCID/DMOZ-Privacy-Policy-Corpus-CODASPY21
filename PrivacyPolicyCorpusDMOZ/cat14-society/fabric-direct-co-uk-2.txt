Sometimes an item may be out of stock and delivery times will be longer. We will contact you if this is the case. The estimated delivery time is usually the maximum time an item should take from ordering to delivery.
For orders to destinations other than mainland UK (including Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland, Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Scilly Isles and Scottish Highlands, including Scottish Isles) despatch dates may differ and if so, the dates will be confirmed at the same time as the quote for the shipping charge. Despatch is then normally within 5 business days from receipt of the payment for shipping.
We have gone to great lengths to ensure that your goods arrive in the same state as when it was packed. Our couriers have years of logistic experience, and have a system in place to ensure the safe arrival of your order.

The carrier will always require a signature when the goods are delivered.

If you notice that the package is damaged in any way, no matter how slight, please sign as ‘DAMAGED’. If you sign for a delivery which you find at a later date is damaged, you may find that the carrier refuses liability.
