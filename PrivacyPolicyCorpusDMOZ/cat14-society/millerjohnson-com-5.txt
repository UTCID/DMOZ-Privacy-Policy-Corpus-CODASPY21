Within Miller Johnson’s Family Law Practice Group, are several lawyers who handle adoption matters in the state of Michigan.  These lawyers possess the qualifications and experience necessary to lead individuals, couples, and families through the adoption process.  Our work on behalf of adoptive parents, birthmothers or agency representatives have involved a variety of scenarios:
Couple or single parent adoption
Stepparent adoption
Legal guardian matters
Parental rights termination
Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)
Miller Johnson’s adoption lawyers have also been retained by individuals and couples, who are often considered “non-traditional” adoptive parents by conventional standards – due to either their age, non-traditional families, families with more than one child, or marital status.
Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) involve adoption issues relating to egg donation, gestational surrogacy or in vitro fertilization issues.  For individuals or couples considering this option, we recommend that an experienced adoption lawyer be consulted. Some of these technologies bring to bear an added level of complexity, as well as uncertainty, from the legal perspective.
Regardless of the adoption scenario, Miller Johnson lawyers work closely with parents or prospective parents to review the Michigan adoption laws and procedures, explain birthparent or adoptive parent rights, advise on legally permissible adoption costs, review and negotiate adoption contracts, and advise on options for post-placement arrangements.
