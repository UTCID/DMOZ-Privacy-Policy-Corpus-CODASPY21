Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis
Human Trafficking
The Franciscan Federation recently passed the following resolution: "Be it resolved that we, as members of the Franciscan Federation, upholding the inherent dignity of each human person in the tradition of St. Francis and St. Clare of Assisi, denounce all forms of human trafficking as criminal acts that violate basic human rights and exploit innocent people. We pledge to work for the elimination of human trafficking and its causes; to advocate for rescue, safety and justice for trafficked persons; and to demand prosecution of perpetrators."
The Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis are members of the Franciscan Federation. The following DVD gives important information on the injustice and horror of human trafficking.
Watch "Lives for Sale," a documentary on immigration and human trafficking. First aired on Public Television and the Hallmark Channel, this one-hour film depicts why immigrants put their very lives at risk in pursuit of the American Dream. Click here to watch the video.
The following websites also provide important information on how to work to end human trafficking:
