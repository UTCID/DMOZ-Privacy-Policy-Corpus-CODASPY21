You should read the Terms carefully prior to your use of the Website, and if you do not agree with or wish to be bound by these Terms, you should not make any further use of this Website and should log off of this Website immediately.
Disclaimer
These materials have been prepared by McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore, L.L.P., for informational purposes only and are not legal advice.   This information is not intended to create, and receipt of it does not constitute, an attorney-client relationship.  Internet subscribers and online readers should not act upon this information without seeking professional counsel.  Do not send us information until you speak with one of our lawyers and get authorization to send that information to us.  The materials on this Website may not reflect the most current legal developments, verdicts or settlements.  Further, prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.
Email Disclaimer
NOTICE: Although we would like to hear from you, we cannot represent you until we know that doing so will not create a conflict of interest.  Also, we cannot treat unsolicited information as confidential.  Accordingly, please do not send us any information about any matter that may involve you until you receive a written statement from us that we represent you (an “engagement letter”).
Communications with us via this Website or via email does not establish an attorney-client relationship and any information sent to us before establishing an attorney-client relationship as evidenced by a signed engagement letter can and will be used for the benefit of the firm’s existing clients; accordingly, until we have formally established an attorney-client relationship with you, do NOT send any confidential information or any information you would expect to be maintained in confidence through this Website or through any email address posted on this Website.
To initiate a possible representation, you should call one of our attorneys at the telephone number specified on the Website.  He or she will determine if any conflict exists, and, if not, put you in touch with an appropriate lawyer.
When you receive an engagement letter from that lawyer, you will be our client, and we may exchange information freely.
By initiating communications with us through the Website (whether by clicking a button labeled "OK," "ACCEPT," "I AGREE," "EMAIL US" or otherwise), you agree that we may review any information you transmit to us.  You recognize that our review of your information prior to the establishment of an attorney-client relationship, even if you submitted it in a good faith effort to retain us, and even if you consider it confidential, does not preclude us from representing another client directly adverse to you, even in a matter where the information could and will be used against you.
