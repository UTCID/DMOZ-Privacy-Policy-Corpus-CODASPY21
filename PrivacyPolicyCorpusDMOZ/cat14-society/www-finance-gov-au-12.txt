5. Preparing a schedule of activities and tasks
5. Preparing a schedule of activities and tasks
Having clarified the scope of work and other project parameters, better-practice entities develop a schedule for preparing financial statements. The schedule is an important tool as it outlines the main activities, events and project milestones—when they are planned to start and when they are due to be completed.
Among other benefits, the schedule will:
help the team and senior executives to monitor progress and, if slippage occurs, develop strategies to bring the project back on track
support workforce planning, to ensure enough people are available at peak times, and
assist communication and engagement with stakeholders, by forecasting planned actions including when input from other areas is needed.
5.1 Scheduling tools and templates
The scheduling process does not need to be onerous and documentation does not need to be overly complex. Before preparing the schedule, it is helpful to clarify if the CFO or other senior officers have specific requirements for the level of documentation they require.
While specific programs for project scheduling are available, an effective schedule may be readily prepared using Microsoft Word, Excel or other programs. If the entity has a project management framework, you may have access to a template for preparing the schedule.
5.1.1 Identifying activities and tasks
The schedule will include varying types of tasks, ranging from the updating of accounting policies to the completion of bank reconciliations. Following are key questions to guide the content included in the project schedule:
Key questions
Content to be included in the schedule
What must be done?
Actions to meet the requirements of legislative frameworks and stakeholders, and to prepare documentation.
How is it to be done?
Actions to enable the use of technology, input from internal and external parties and the frequency of communication.
Who is going to do it?
Internal and external resources and the responsible officers or business areas.
When is it to be done?
When financial statements must be prepared for review by various parties. When tasks should start and end for on time delivery.
How will risks be treated?
The risk treatment activities required and when these occur.
5.1.2 Identifying milestones and critical events
When developing the project schedule, it is useful to review the schedule from the prior year, looking at when activities were planned and how long they took to complete. It may be possible to use last year’s schedule as the starting point—refreshing and amending the previous project activities and adjusting the timeline to reflect the current year’s needs.
The finance team should start the process by making a list of project milestones and critical events, and then build the list of activities, tasks, responsibilities and timeframes around these events. Working backwards from the most critical milestone date, which is generally the signing of the financial statements, is often the most effective means of determining realistic timeframes.
The team should consider the sequence of critical events and then estimate the time required for each event. This includes the provision of information from external parties, such as shared services providers.
Entities should try to avoid being overly optimistic when estimating the time required for project activities. The largely sequential nature of the closing process means that a missed deadline can significantly delay the entire process and jeopardise the timeliness of the financial statements.
If possible, try to build a buffer into the timeline as a contingency for dealing with unplanned tasks or delays. Management should also commit sufficient resources to mitigate any risks associated with meeting the deadlines.
5.1.3 Nominating responsible officers
The project schedule should be supported by instructions outlining relevant responsibilities, and the various requirements to be met during the process of preparing the financial statements. Where possible, the schedule should directly reference documents and provide details of where to find them.
5.1.4 Engaging with stakeholders in preparing the schedule
Increasingly, stakeholders involved in the financial statements will include other entities, such as shared services providers, from which data and information is required for inclusion in the financial statements. It is therefore important that the responsibilities of all these entities be included in the project schedule and details regarding required timeframes be communicated and agreed with them.
The draft schedule should be distributed to relevant parties for comment with the final schedule being agreed with the audit committee, and approved by the CFO. The final schedule should then be circulated to all stakeholders with detailed instructions and/or briefings arranged to ensure stakeholders understand and can meet key deliverables.
