Single in the City is not liable for any stolen or lost items during this activity/event, including any items left behind afterwards. Each individual agrees that if intoxicated, they will not operate a motorized vehicle upon leaving an activity/event. Single in the City employees, tour guides, hosts or drivers reserve the right to remove any person displaying inappropriate or disruptive behaviour and/or acts in a manner that we deem rude, threatening, indecent or offensive and/or anyone causing a threat to the safety of other individuals. Each individual is solely responsible for the use of any equipment during an activity/event and responsible for the repair and replacement of any broken, lost or stolen items during or after the activity/event. Once registered and before, during and after any person’s participation in this activity/event, Single in the City and their employees, owners or shareholders will be relieved from any liability and responsibility for any claims for loss, damage, injuries, criminal or civil litigation for/from the registrant/member/ individual resulting from any activity/event.
5. Single in the City Dating Inc reserves the right to remove anyone from an event if their behaviour is non-compliant with our rules and regulations or acts in a manner that we deem rude, threatening, indecent, offensive or inappropriate.
6. By participating in any Single in the City Dating Inc. event, you give us permission to forward and share your online dating profile (should you have one) and/or your first name, last initial, email address and if you choose via your online account preferences a consented phone number and /or photograph (as uploaded by you) to your mutual matches (a mutual match is when you select yes for a participant who also selected yes for you). We do not take any responsibility for markings on your match card made by you that were inaccurate resulting in a match where your online dating profile, first name, last initial, email address, consented phone number and/or image was exchanged.  We will not forward your email address or consented phone number to any other persons in attendance at the event other than your mutual matches without your permission.
7. Single in the City Dating Inc. offers a “no picks” guarantee at our speed dating events. The guarantee applies if you do not mark a “yes” for anyone on your match card when that card is handed in following the event. In this case the registrant will receive one complimentary speed dating event code that can be used within 90 days following the attended event.   The “no picks” guarantee does not apply to the case of “no matches” in where you have selected yes for someone but it was not of mutual consent. The “no picks” guarantee ONLY applies if a registrant has paid in full for the event, participates in the full event and hands in a match card with no “yes’s” marked at the end of the evening.  Single in the City Dating Inc. has the right to revoke our “no picks” guarantee policy at our own discretion.  HOW TO REDEEM THE FREE EVENT: Once you have handed in your “no picks” match card, 48 hours following the event, you will log into the website and in MY EVENT MATCHES you will have received a FREE EVENT CODE from SITC.  This code MUST be redeemed online by copying and pasting the code upon registering for another speed date. The code is valid  for a 90 day period. There are no extensions on FREE events for any circumstances.   There are NO cancellations on events that are booked using your free “NO PICKS” code, however, if cancelled within the 5 business days prior to the event date, you may transfer the free event to another event date that is within four (4) weeks of the event you are cancelling. We must be notified of your new event choice at the time of cancellation. The FREE “NO PICKS” event only applies to Speed Dating events. Free events are not transferable to other people.

If no specific issue date is known, such credit offer will expire 1 (one) year from the date of the cancelled or unattended event in which the credit was offered. Single in the City Dating Inc. has the right to revoke any credit or free event from any user at any time at our own discretion.
9. In the case where Single in the City Dating Inc. has listed an event with specific details such as city, date, venue and age range and one or more of those items must be changed due to circumstances beyond our control (ie: weather, venue issues etc.) the clients will be notified of the change as soon as possible and the event may be postponed. In the event that a client cannot attend a new postponed date a “Credit” will be issued (Credits are for the dollar value of a purchased ticket that can be used at a future date). A “Credit” or refund may be issued (at SITC’s discretion) for changes in age range or city, if requested. However, if an event venue is changed but remains in the same city, no refunds or credits will be given, as the event will continue to run in the same city and same age range listed.
10. Single in the City Dating Inc. does not in any way guarantee the results of any Single in the City Dating Inc. event, we do not guarantee that participants will receive mutual matches or that dates or relationships will occur from any mutual matches received. You the participant understand and acknowledge that we provide an outlet and opportunity for you the client to meet other single people. We do not and cannot guarantee that each Single in the City client has supplied us with accurate and truthful information about their status or background as we do not do any background screening or checks. We do no guarantee any individual successful matches or the success of any match between two participants. Single in the City Dating Inc takes no responsibility in your mutual matches contacting you following the exchange of your contact information.
11. In the case of double speed dating events (ie: two events with different age groups held on the same date at the same venue) cancellations are not accepted based on attendance with a friend. ie.
