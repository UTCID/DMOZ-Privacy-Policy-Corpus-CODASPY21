Internet Privacy for Kids
Your privacy on the internet depends on how much you want and how much your parent or the adult supervising your internet activities allows. Even though you may object to your parent or an adult
“treating you like a baby”, they are still responsible for your safety and everything you do with both your everyday activities and online activities. The amount of freedom you earn or are given by your parent or supervising adult with your online activities is no different than with your everyday activities. If you are allowed or forbidden to read “this” kind of book or hang out in “this” neighborhood, assume it is true on the internet. Remember that as long as you are under 18 years old, the parent or adult that you live with in the USA has the option and right to go through any of your belongings,
including your computer or the computer that you use. This does not mean that every parent will search through every file in every computer used by every child. It simply means that your parent or supervising adult wants to keep you safe while allowing you enough freedom to explore the world (including the internet) in keeping with the beliefs and values of your family – and, in the United States they are allowed to do this if they choose.
When you visit a website that is specifically for kids your age (under 13) and they require you to complete a registration form, the website in the USA can only ask for your first name, username, email
address and age. If the website will not let you register without telling more personal information, it is required to get permission from your parent or guardian before you are allowed to participate in any activities or be added to their mailing list. Your parent will be able to visit the website review the website’s privacy, spam and third party advertisement policies before giving consent. You and your parent can tell the website that is in the USA to remove all or some of the information you gave them.
Older kids should keep a watch for the younger ones on the internet. Glance at the computer monitor once in a while when a youngster is on the internet to be sure they are not at any
“bad” websites or talking to strangers.
