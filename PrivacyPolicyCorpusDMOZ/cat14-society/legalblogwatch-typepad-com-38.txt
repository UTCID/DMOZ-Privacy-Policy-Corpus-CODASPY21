What would you ask Roberts?
A group of Democratic Senators want to hear from the public what questions they should ask Judge Roberts at the confirmation hearings next week. Submit your question. (Hat tip: Howard Bashman)
Also on the Roberts pre-confirmation watch, a new anti-Roberts ad, discussed here, here and here. And Tommy Goldstein of Stanford Law School and Scotus Blog will be liveblogging the hearings next week at their spinoff Supreme Court Nomination Blog, where there is already a ton of great information about Roberts, including all the cases he argued in the Supreme Court and a round-up of the latest headlines on the hearings.

Tracking time and billing
Rees Morrison at Law Department Management reports that the NYC Law Department has started (over significant dissent) requiring its 650 attorneys to keep track of their time. The department has also started sending hypothetical bills to city agencies for the department's services.
So much for avoiding life in the sixth-of-an-hour zone by steering clear of firm employment.  I've always felt that keeping track of your time the way law firms require is pretty demeaning.  But I do think that letting agencies know how much time lawyers are spending on their complaints is a worthwhile task. Rees advises:Every law department that does not charge back the fees and expenses of outside counsel retained to defend the company in litigation could consider this innovative technique. If you can estimate internal hours (and multiply them by your fully-loaded internal cost per lawyer hour), so much the better.

'Storage Technology Corp.' decision
Cathy Kirkman at the Silicon Valley Media Law Blog has an excellent discussion of the the Federal Circuit's decision in Storage Technology Corp. v. Custom Hardware Engineering & Consulting. As Cathy says, "The case is noteworthy for a number of reasons -- it takes a limited view of the scope of the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions, and it takes a broad view of the rights of third party agents to access software for maintenance purposes under copyright law, as well under software license terms."
Custom Hardware is a company that fixes data libraries. The court found that the maintenance and repair of computer systems that Custom Hardware performed was not a copyright infringement, so its actions did not trigger the DMCA.  For DMCA minimalists, this is a great decision because; as Cathy says, "It  suggests that if a technological control were circumvented for a noninfringing personal or fair use, the DMCA circumvention could be permissible." The court also concluded that the license allowed third party access to the code, even though it did not explicitly say so.  For licensing attorneys, this means you need to be really careful in your drafting, and as Cathy advises, "License agreements need to be drafted with precision and clarity, and should be drafted from an all rights not expressly granted are reserved standpoint."

Virtual roundtable on 'Grokster' decision
Robert Ambrogi points to this virtual roundtable discussion of the Grokster decision from a special issue of the newsletter Internet Law & Strategy. It is between members of  the magazine's board of editors and other Internet law experts, including Ambrogi, who wrote: For companies involved in developing technology-based products and services, the immediate lesson of this case is to watch what you say. Focus on the product's legitimate commercial applications. A more troubling issue arises from between the lines of the Grokster decision -- that of whether a company is obliged to act when it suspects its product is being used for unlawful purposes. Here, the Court finds evidence of the companies' unlawful objectives in their failure to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to reduce copyright infringement. This failure to act underscores the companies' intent, the Court said. However, the Court quickly adds, in a footnote, that a company's mere failure to act to prevent infringement, absent other evidence of intent, is not grounds for liability. (Also check for his comments on comparisons to Sony.) Like most cases that create or alter standards, we really will not understand the full impact of Grokster until the first judge applies it. But it is interesting to see what this diverse group of experts has to say, particularly, how they are advising clients in light of the decision.

Creative networking opportunities (for both sexes)
Following up on the meme of the Glass Ceiling, The Common Scold points to a piece in Sunday's NYT, in Lisa Belkin's "Life's Work" column that asks: "What are your networking alternatives if you don't play golf?" As Common Scold notes:Belkin talks about various "affinity" groups that can serve the same purpose. She cites Diane Danielson, who founded a young women's networking organization, downtownwomensclub.com, and suggests alternatives to ball fields, such as taking folks to the theater. "I generally try to get three tickets and invite two clients who might enjoy meeting each other," she says. And that also mitigates an often-sticky situation if you are entertaining male clients, who might mistake the invite for a date, she says.  She also talks about how Winston &  Strawn offers events planned just for women clients and partners -- such as a private viewing of the Chanel exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.As I said yesterday, it's about women having options and making choices. Kudos to Belkin for pointing out some. Though I must say, this is just as valid for men who don't golf. Networking is incredibly essential for everyone in many businesses, including law. If your opportunities seem limited because you're not interested in the options available, it's up to you to create your own.

Critical thinking
Bruce MacEwen, over at Adam Smith, Esq., urges you to read this Harvard Business Review column to determine whether you really are a critical thinker. He says that he thought he was preblogging, but was surprised to learn how passively he used to absorb information when he wasn't thinking of how to "critique, extrapolate, synthesize, or otherwise comment intelligently."
I'm experiencing this phenomenon this week, as I write this blog. Reading the blawgs is time-consuming, and commenting on them takes it up a couple of notches. The upside is that you get so much more out of what you read when you are forced to write your thoughts down, which is one reason I enjoy blogging so much. I sense Adam Smith, Esq. agrees.

Vigilante Justice vs. Speech
Crime & Federalism points to a debate on PrawfsBlog about e-shaming.  The debate started with an article in the LA Times about Fox news releasing the home address of a known terrorist. Satellite photos of the house and directions to the residence were posted online.  Turns out the house had been sold three years prior, and “[f]or the last 2 1/2 weeks, the lives of the couple and their three children have been plunged into an unsettling routine of drivers shouting profanities, stopping to photograph their house and -- most recently -- spray-painting a slogan on their property.”
Dan Solove thinks that releasing information like this is vigilante justice, and Mike says it’s free speech.  As personal information becomes more easy to spread and access, I have no doubt that we’re going to see more of this.  Like many conflicts between privacy and speech, I’m less sure on which side I stand.

NARAL's new ad gets it 'mostly right'
FactCheck.org has signed off on NARAL’s most recent ad on Roberts’ abortion position, finding that the ad gets it “mostly right.”  You can read the script on the site, and according to the review, “The latest ad takes a different tack, and was even produced by a different ad firm. Where the first ad showed images of a bombed-out abortion clinic, this ad shows images of a happy, smiling families and a tender couple. And rather than falsely implying that Roberts condones violence, this one mostly sticks to the facts.”
Whatever you think of the nominee, we should all agree to just stick to the facts.

Liability and blog comments
Seobook is a blog about search engines. Traffic Power, in the search engine advertising business, just sued Seobook and a gaggle of Does and Roes, for defamation and trade secret violations. Seobook posted the complaint in Nevada's Clark County district court. Here, you can see an earlier cease-and-desist letter.
One issue in the case is whether a blog editor is responsible for what is said in his or her contents, and a debate is raging on Seobook and elsewhere as to whether moderating comments increases or decreases any potential liability. Aaron Wall, the blog editor, writes that he’s likely to just take the offensive content down once he gets Traffic Power to articulate exactly what’s bugging them. While I haven’t read the offending comments, I hope he doesn’t cave that easily. This is a topic I’m very interested in ... what do you think?

The Glass Ceiling
Thanks to Carolyn Elefant for pointing to this article about a Sacramento lawyer’s initiative to address work-balance issues that create huge gender differences at the top of most law firms.  The initiative is based on San Francisco’s No Glass Ceiling project, “which aims to prod local law firms to make work environments more family-friendly and promote more women up the ranks.” According to the article, “In 2002, a group of [San Francisco] lawyers began signing up 76 law firms and legal departments to agree to a pledge: By 2005, make sure at least 25 percent of partners are women. In 2002, 22 percent of firms met that goal. As of July, 63 percent had, according to the task force's most recent survey.”
Elefant fears she sounds too much like the young John Roberts when she says, “I'm all in favor of attorneys -- male or female -- who choose to forego their careers short term to stay home with children so long as they're aware of middle-of-the-road options for balancing law and family.”
No worries, Carolyn. You’ve got it right when you say it’s about women having options and making choices that work for them.  We’ll see how Roberts spins his words at his hearings next week.

Why I'm glad this dude never showed up for work
Once upon a time, Mike Fox reports, two buddies left for a bar. They drank. And then they drank some more. They drank enough that Dude #1 asked Buddy #2 for a favor. Clock me in if I'm too hung to be on time, Buddy?
Sure, Dude. Buddy delivered. And when Dude didn't show at all, Buddy clocked him out, too.
When the fog cleared a couple of days later, Buddy and Dude confessed to their supervisor and were fired. The men tried to sue for discrimination, arguing that two women colleagues got away with it. Turns out, however, that the women showed up for work eventually -- as opposed to getting credit for a day when they played hooky, as Dude did.
But I'm glad Dude played hooky if he was too altered to perform on the job.  Why? Because Dude and Buddy are mechanics for a school district, and I just signed my son's field trip permission slip. 'Nuff said.

8th Circuit judgment 'clouded by wicked weed'
So asks Doug Berman in a fantastic post on U.S. v. Chauncey, in which he describes the 8th Circuit's decision to uphold a pre-Booker sentence of 100 months for less than two ounces of marijuana. (Hat-tip to Mike Cernovich, who authored one of the Ashcroft v. Raich blogs). Berman writes: "The defendant in Chauncey, as a result of a criminal history leading to his classification as a career offender, received a sentence of 100 months after being convicted of possessing with intent to distribute less than two ounces of marijuana.  According to Judge [Donald P.] Lay's dissent, 'Chauncey's undisputed purpose was to help [his friend] obtain marijuana to alleviate the painful effects of her multiple sclerosis.' ... In a spirited dissent, Judge Lay argues that 100 months for Chauncey's offense violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments.  ... Disappointingly, Judge Lay's dissent does not engage the issue of reasonableness after Booker (although surely he believes the sentence is unreasonable as well as unconstitutional)."

SOX co-author calls Sarbanes-Oxley 'flawed jewel'
"You think?  No kidding," writes J. Craig Williams in his wrap-up of Congressman Michael Oxley's recent visit to Williams' zip code.  Williams continues, "Oxley himself pointed out the statute's flawed requirements using an example in his own district, Ball Metal.  The auditors there listed the janitor's theft of a few toilet paper rolls from the company bathrooms as a 'material weakness' that had to be listed on the company's reports to the SEC and investors.
"I don't know about you, but I'm selling my stock in Ball because those rolls of TP will likely break the company.  Riiiight.  They likely spent more money on the reporting aspects of that issue than the cost of the missing rolls.  While Oxley didn't commit to amendments to the law, he did pin his hopes on Orange County's Chris Cox, now at the helm of the SEC.  Oxley stated in the Register's article that he expects Cox to loosen the 'too stiff' burden of SOX compliance on small and midsize businesses ..."More here.

A psychological profile of your boss here
What do you call a litigation support partner who freaks because the three-inch binders his grunts have been building all day have two different colors of white paper? (True story: I was one of the grunts who listened to this man's rant about the need for consistency in coloration between paper reams. Not that I noticed the difference in color. I was busy billing 80 hours a week to count the pages in each binder to make certain each had its appropriate 317 pages. For this I went to college? Buh-bye ...)
According to a new survey on legal leadership styles written up by The Wired GC, you'd call this guy a "pacesetter." WGC has his usual dry take on the issue: "Not surprisingly, the associates preferred leadership that emphasized coaching to edicts from a driven 'pacesetter,'" he writes.  "I think I worked for a pacesetter once, but that’s not what I called him at the time ..."
In addition to pacesetting, the other five categories tested for effectiveness were "directive, visionary, affiliative, participative and coaching."  Read the textbook definition and more on the survey here.

Discriminating prejudices: gay and religious rights
A former Allstate employee says religious discrimination is the reason he was fired, after he wrote an anti-gay article.
Allstate says it fired him for using employer property for private pursuits.
I say, as we wait out the eve of yet another Congress riven by religious differences, that you should read Mike Fox's thoughtful assessment of the case, both from the employer's perspective and that of a policy implementer. Fox writes, "Being an employer has never been easy, but in a world where personal communication on a wide spread basis is not only easy, but done daily by hundreds of thousands of individuals who are also often employees, and where there are increasingly hard-line positions on matters of politics, idealogy and religion, you know that conflicts are going to come and employers may often find themselves in the middle. ... This volatile mix will only become more difficult if legislation that has been introduced for the last several Congresses by those on opposite ends of the political spectrum ever becomes a reality. See my earlier post, Workplace Religious Freedom Act - Consensus On Neither the Right Nor Left."

Want to cut costs? 'Don't hire a head of litigation!'
Given Rees Morrison's typical restraint in the use of punctuation, I was amazed to read this headline from his weekend blog posts: "Don’t hire a head of litigation!" It's one of 10 rules for cutting litigation costs recommended by Jeff Carr of FMC Technologies. Morrison likes and recommends reading the rules -- especially this one:
"Here’s Carr’s zinger. Don’t hire a head litigator, for the reason that 'the last thing that person wants to do is work himself out of a job.' Carr advocates making business lawyers responsible for litigation, presumably because they will take a commercial view of resolving a dispute as promptly as possible and with a view to ongoing relations or bottom-line effect."

Did Mark Lanier win, or did Merck lose?
Many Monday-morning quarterbacks are clustered around Merck's whopping $253 million defeat of Friday afternoon, notes The Wired GC.

He asks, "Once Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market, in a move they probably thought would be strategically sound (and perhaps even publicly praised), every word written or spoken about Vioxx was put under a different microscope than Merck was familiar with. People who do drug research are focused on finding cures and enhancing treatments, not writing exhibits for their depositions ..."What do you think?

In a nod to a change in today's blogroll, I'd like to thank Matt Homann for helping to launch the Law.com Blog Network last fall. Since then, he's changed the focus of his blog, the [non]billable hour, from running his small firm in the Midwest to a new consulting enterprise in the Los Angeles area. I'll be watching what he does next -- and hoping he continues his signature interviews, the Five-by-Five series, archived here.

Would Huck Finn be found guilty today?
Author Mark Twain may rest easy says J. Craig Williams, in his interpretation of a recent Missouri Supreme Court ruling. Williams begins: "You remember Huckleberry Finn and his friend Jim?  They find a corpse, but don't report it to the authorities.  Did they violate Missouri law all those years ago?  Is Mark Twain rolling over in his grave?
"Twain fans will be relieved to know the Missouri Supreme Court doesn't think so.  The story has a modern-day twist:  a Missouri man convicted for doing so had that conviction overturned based on Twain's tale ... "More here.

MacEwen: "Coudert, RIP"
Blogger Bruce MacEwen, who has been following the story of Coudert before its merger talks with Baker & McKenzie, writes an insightful epitaph. He begins: "We note with great sadness the passing of a 150-plus-year-old firm, a pioneer on the international scene in ways many are still trying to emulate. (Also here.) "The firm's demise strikes me as exceedingly unnecessary -- given the long perspective -- but essentially inevitable, on the short perspective.  And sometimes the short run gets you, as vicious (and virtuous, but that's for another day) cycles are real.  Rumors ..."

Apt furnished with Fedex boxes
Bill Heinze passes along a terrific story from the PHOSITA blog. Apparently FedEx is miffed at a
man who has furnished his entire apartment with FedEx boxes. FedEx sees his work as a violation of copyright and trademark laws. The creator -- and his attorneys at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society -- see it differently. Here's an excerpt from Melody Wirz's post at PHOSITA: "FedEx has sent a letter insisting that the furniture itself, along with theInternet Website and the pictures violate the copyright and trademark rightsheld by FedEx. The letter even claims that the actions fall within thepurview of the DMCA. Luckily, the creator is represented by the Stanford LawSchool Center for Internet and Society who sent this letter in response." More photos and info here.

Remove head from sand, apply firm blogging policy
Geoff Gussis has the diplomacy required of a successful in-house counsel. "Are your employees blogging?" he gently asks. "By making sure that your company and its bloggers are on the same page, you can ensure that blogging wil be a win-win situation for both parties. Michael P. Maslanka, the managing partner of the Dallas office of Ford & Harrison, has great tips for in-house counsel grappling with employee blogging issue ..."
I'm not an in-house counsel, so I won't act like one.  If some of your employees aren't blogging, openly or anonymously, they will be soon. So take Gussis' advice and circulate a policy now. Here are some others to consider:
