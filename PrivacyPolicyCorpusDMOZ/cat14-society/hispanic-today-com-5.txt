How to write an email reply to an interview request
Responding to an interview request can seem like a mundane thing. However, it is a very crucial step in the hiring process, just as essential as your qualifications and skills are. Before any personal meeting with the managers, your behavior is your qualification. Even before actually meeting they form opinions about you as a potential candidate. It may sometimes hard to get an interview when you are a person of color or specifically Hispanic American. There are some portions of America that think it still matter matters and this is to help prepare you to overcome that.
Your manners of verbal and written communication are an essential part of your job. When you deal with the manager of the company, you should maintain proper etiquettes; your selection may be possible due to it as the first impression has long term impacts on someone’s mind, especially in these professional interview appointments.
Email response:
In this modern era of technology, you can quickly respond to an interview request. When you know that you sent applications for many positions, then consider evaluating your email frequently and answer all the requests as early as possible. Many smartphones can send push notifications whenever you receive any email. You should always remember to address any question that they may have- this is necessary if they have questioned you when you are available?
Alternative time:
If the day and time are not convenient or suitable for you, then you can ask him to rearrange the schedule according to possibilities.
Hispanic should tell the interviewer that you highly appreciate the invitation, but you have a scheduling conflict. Some companies offer more than one day and time for the interview, so you should choose the best date and time for you.
When you are choosing, then you should select the morning over the afternoon, most preferably mid-morning.
You should avoid Mondays and Fridays if possible because people can usually be distracted.
Sooner rather than later is always best.
Appreciation:
You should always remember that etiquettes like mentioning “please” and “thank you” can go a long way. A large number of people applied for the same post, but only a few received an interview call.
The facts that you have been chosen shows that you have an impressive qualification that can be fit for the position that can be made through specific processes of screening. The great companies love to place friendly candidates in the workplace.
Responding if you are not interested:
If you are not interested in the job or the compensation, you do not need to share all the details. You can briefly write an email by saying how you appreciate the offer and the opportunity but you’re not interested, and offer to stay connected for future opportunities. If you do not want to stay connected, then that’s alright. You might also offer to refer a friend or colleague for that particular job if  you know someone who meets qualifications.
Conclusion:
Always respond correctly to secure the interview and make a good impression at the same time. Do not throw away your hard work and waste the opportunity. You should reply promptly and carefully to accept the invitation. Furthermore, tips and things to avoid will be explained in the next article.
