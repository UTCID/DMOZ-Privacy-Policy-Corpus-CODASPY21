WHAT WATERCOOLER?
Great books
Just in time for a New Year's weekend off, the blogosphere's rife with opinion over new and not-so-new books and movies. Todd Zywicki fell so in love with Tom Wolfe's latest novel that he dang near missed the beauty of St. Lucia. And, as I mentioned yesterday, The Common Scold has a long list of favorites in her blog's right-hand margin.
Reel torture and salvation
Honeymooner David Bernstein was not so lucky, however: Trapped on multiple planes in a whirlwind tour of Hawaii, Guam, Australia and Tokyo, he suffered through some, er, reel torture. The worst of the worst, in his opinion? "Collateral." Which may be why Mike Geoghegan, May It Please The Court's guest-blogger, reached for the archives to review "It's A Wonderful Life."
Gasp! Actual work-related reading
Mike Fox has this story of a state worker who's suing because she's forced to read books all day long. Not really -- it's one detail of her allegation that she was relegated to the back office after complaining about having to attend a governor's prayer breakfast.
Bill Heinze recommends "Prisoners' Inventions," a fascinating read on IP and creativity behind bars.
Orin Kerr is enthusiastic about Larry Lessig's plans to use a wiki to update one of his books.
Meanwhile, blogfather Eugene Volokh is busy castigating his own writing. The only advice I can offer is the book I turn to in my own desperate writing times: here.

NO LIPSTICK? YOU'RE FIRED!
Once upon a time, Harrah's had a bartender who didn't wear lipstick.
Then one day, the chain's image got a corporate makeover. All of a sudden, cosmetics were required for women and banned for men.
Unfortunately, the bartender who didn't wear lipstick was a woman named Darlene Jespersen. When Jespersen refused to put on lipstick, or any other make-up for that matter, she was fired. So she filed a lawsuit claiming sexual discrimination.
That's legal, a majority of the 9th Circuit Court told her. Read on to find out why Mike Fox of Jottings by an Employer's Lawyer thinks this case is far from over.

MY SPOUSE GETS THAT MY BLACKBERRY COMES FIRST -- WHY DOESN'T MY CLIENT?
Ever wonder how it is that attorneys are lumped in with car dealers and advertisers, as professionals most likely to be unethical and dishonest? (Here's such a survey, as recently discovered by Carolyn Elefant.)
Mulling this issue, I clicked over to The Common Scold and found my answer. Check out Monica Bay's latest posting on this new anti-faux pas training video for big firm lawyers. Suffice it to say that a BlackBerry -- and an arrogant young associate -- share starring, cringeworthy roles.

CASE STUDY: DO-RIGHT INCENTIVE OR PANDORA'S TORT-BOX?
A $6 million punitive award in a contract lawsuit has raised both of J. Craig Williams' eyebrows.
After he weighs the merits of both majority and dissenting opinions in Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., Williams wonders what will become of California's legal tradition of preventing companies who sued for breach of contract from recovering punitive damages:"That chasm provided predictability for businesses that damages would be limited solely to economic losses -- those losses that come from damages as a direct result of the contract breach (not punitive damages). The so-called economic loss rule, however, just got hammered by the Supreme Court. Flattened may be a better word. Like a steamroller."

CYBERSPACE: WHEN SURFING IS A CRIME
The state of California has launched a new online database of registered sex offenders, reports The Volokh Conspiracy, and one group is explicitly forbidden to surf it: the offenders themselves.
If sex offenders "access" the site, it's a misdemeanor under Megan's Law. Is this the first time a law has made it a crime for certain people to access a public Web site? Nope, answers crim law professor Orin Kerr, who recently wrote a law review article on the topic.
Is this law blatantly unconstitutional? Michael Cernovich thinks so.

AN EVERYDAY RESOLUTION: DON'T BE A @#$^*!!?!
As you know, I think Matt Homann's got some good advice in his Resolutions for Lawyers.
I'd like to add a resolution, based on an experience I had while dropping off my brother, sister-in-law and infant niece at San Francisco International Airport last week. I pulled up at curbside check-in with their 20 bags. As we began to unload the car, the following scene unfolded:
Guy #1 is a hipster in a Sherlock Holmes hat and sunglasses. He approaches Guy #2, a shorter, hatless fellow in a nice sweater with both arms through his backpack straps. They're both in their late 20s.
Guy #2 is returning his luggage cart to the Smart Cart kiosk, the kind where you have to pay $3 to extract a cart. It's a pretty busy morning, but it's the week before Christmas and some of the airline folks are wearing smiles and Santa hats. Pretty festive.
HIPSTER: Hi! Hey, man, mind if I grab your cart? SWEATER: Silent. Freezes, hands on cart. HIPSTER: Smiles, relaxed and friendly.
Suddenly, SWEATER narrows his eyes and darts two feet past HIPSTER to jam the rental cart back into the cart kiosk.
HIPSTER: Wha..? Hey, man, what're you doing, man!? SWEATER: Makes a nasty face at Hipster, puts both hands on his backpack straps and tries to walk quickly away.
HIPSTER: Hey, F--- YOU, man! You MUTHAF---ER, WHAT AN A--HOLE, MAN! HEY!!!!!! Little f--ker...
SWEATER: Runs into building At this point, my sister-in-law is staring open-mouthed at both these men, her hands clapped over her baby's ears. She's appalled. My brother, who was putting the baby seat into some crazy suitcase, is kneeling on the curbside, pounding the concrete as he howls with laughter. I am crying I'm laughing so hard. LISA: Barely able to speak. Hey, Merry Christmas, man.
HIPSTER: Did you see that little f--ker?? Holy s--- man, what a @#$^!!!@$%!$!!! I'm going to get him.
LISA: Unable to talk, howling and wiping her eyes LISA'S BROTHER: Still kneeling on ground, giggling. Listen, do you need $3 man? Seriously. No problem.
HIPSTER: looking brokenhearted. No, man, I have the money, it's just ... oh man. Walks away.
LISA AND BRO collapse again. Sister-in-law rolls eyes and stalks off.
LISA'S BROTHER: You know what's going to happen. That little s--- is going to be sitting next to him on the plane. Oh, man I hope it's our flight.
HIPSTER: Comes back to stuff money into cart kiosk. LISA: Preparing to drive away. Hey, seriously, Merry Christmas, man. Geez...
HIPSTER: Smiling again, but still shaking his head. Yeah. It's cool. Merry Christmas.
I'm just glad my eight-year-old wasn't present for this particular display of holiday selfishness. My question for you is -- what shall I resolve, to give away carts or to demand at least some of my $3 from my fellow passengers? I'm leaning toward the gift -- $3 seems a small price to pay to help someone out, given everything else that's going wrong in the world.
How about your holiday travels -- what did you witness? E-mail me here. I'd love to blog your story this week.

"SAVVY BLAWGERS" CHALLENGE
"Looking out five to 10 years, what will the single most significant change be in terms of how sophisticated law firms (think AmLaw 200) are managed, on the 'business side'?"That's the question blogger Bruce MacEwen asked a panel of savvy lawyers he put together. And savvy they all are, beginning with Monica Bay of The Common Scold, who writes: "I think we are in the midst of a huge paradigm shift that is radically changing the entire legal industry. In a nutshell, the profession is changing from a private club to a corporate model, from "Eat What You Kill" to collaboration. It isn't happening overnight, but it is profound and I truly believe that any firm that doesn't pay attention will end up as roadkill..." moreDon't miss the other panelists, including Matt Homann, J.

PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS: A REALITY CHECK
Now that he's noted the dearth of presidential pardons for federal crimes issued by George W. Bush, professor Orin Kerr is getting an earful from Volokh Conspiracy readers. The good professor opened the discussion by writing, "...[I]t's the president's job to do the right thing regardless of what the pollsters say. There are currently 150,000 people in federal prisons, with another 50,000 or so on probation. Could it be that none of them deserve presidential pardons?"The response? Oh please -- from many quarters. Reader Greedy Clerk comments, "That has to be a joke, right? This is from the president who has asserted that he has the right to detain U.S. citizens on U.S. soil indefinitely and with NO PROCESS WHATSOEVER..."C'mon, writes Jeff the Baptist, "Bush honestly has had better things to do."

'A VICTORY FOR FREE SPEECH'
Once upon a time, the California Supreme Court held a national magazine liable for revealing that a man had been convicted of a felony (an armed robbery that included "a gun battle with the local police"). Why? The Court felt it was an invasion of privacy.
One day, 30 years later, in Gates v. Discovery Communications, Inc., the California Supreme Court overturned the decision and declared that people are free to tell the truth about others' past crimes. Excellent, declared blogfather Eugene Volokh, who calls the decision "a victory for free speech."

ATTORNEYS WHO EMBEZZLE, SPAM AND SPIN
Attorneys who embezzle: More than we know?
Carolyn Elefant examines the arrest of former big-firm partner Jamie Perdigao for embezzling as much as $20 million from his law firm.  Over on MyShingle.com, she's wondering about his firm's legal exposure --  and whether other firms should be worried, too: "I wonder whether Perdigao is the exception to the rule who just became so brazen that he got caught -- or whether there are other attorneys at firms, large and small, who steal from clients and their fellow partners albeit in smaller increments.  Love to hear the inside scoop from any readers."What do you think?

Jetsons-style patent filing for $329
Why go through the minutiae of filing a patent when a machine will do it for you? Talk to Bill Heinze, who writes about a company that has automated the process of preparing and filing a provisional patent application. They'll do it for just $329 (or $529 if they also do the drawings), he reports. While there's some risk to a mechanized app, Heinze says on I/P Updates, there could also be a benefit: "This type of technology might be an excellent way to get more-detailed invention disclosure documents from inventors so that their attorneys can do better work. And, as every patent attorney knows, when the client is in a pickle, filing a thorough invention disclosure document is often better than not filing at all."Lies, damn lies and media reports on polls
Do 44 percent of Americans really want to curtail the rights of Muslim Americans? Professor Orin Kerr examines a pollster's math and discovers -- gasp! -- media spin on the story. As J. Craig Williams writes here, I've been doing some thinking about spin lately myself.

SF'S SWEEPING GUN BAN AND MARVEL COMICS
San Francisco's sweeping suggestion: Ban guns
Blogfather Eugene Volokh raises an interesting point about the sweeping gun ban San Francisco supervisors proposed today.
Here's the scoop: The Associated Press reports that San Francisco supervisors, no strangers to controversy, have voted to put a gun ban on the 2005 municipal ballot. The proposal would:
Prohibit almost everyone except police, security guards and military from possessing firearms in the city.
Bar residents from keeping guns in homes or businesses.
Prohibit the selling, manufacturing and distributing of handguns and ammunition.
Noting that San Francisco's foray is the latest in a series of gun control restrictions around the nation, professor Eugene Volokh indicates he can understand why gun rights advocates find it hard to believe "no-one is trying to take people's guns." He notes, "I take it that abortion rights activists in California wouldn't be persuaded by anti-abortion activists' arguments that "Oh, don't worry, we won't ban abortions in California, since obviously we wouldn't have the votes; we're just trying to ban them in Texas." Presumably the abortion rights activists would say that they care about what they see as the fundamental rights of people all over the country. Likewise, I would think, with gun rights activists."What do you think -- common ground?

Joystiq gives kudos to Fred von Lohmann's piece, "Et tu, Marvel?" in which von Lohmann warns: ”...If the court accepts Marvel’s notion that playing Wolverine or the Incredible Hulk online is unlawful, you can expect a chill to spread through all the MMO universes. Rights holders will begin insisting that MMO operators police their games for unauthorized elements -- robots that look too much like C3PO, uniforms that look too much like Captain Kirk’s, haircuts that mimic Bart Simpson’s, in-game face paint that evokes KISS, or blonde vampire slayers named Buffy.”The burden of production

Think Manhattan rents are scary? Even more frightening is this woman's story of renting an apartment in New York, as relayed by J. Craig Williams on May It Please The Court.

A BROTHER'S MOTION, JUDGE WAPNER AND DIRTBAGS
State v. Yarbrough: A brother's motion for reconsideration
A 2L Yalie, Chris Muha, is looking for help with a motion for reconsideration in State v. Yarbrough. Earlier this month, the Ohio Supreme Court overturned both a murder conviction and a death sentence for Terrell Yarbrough for the 1999 murders of two college students.
Why? And why is Chris Muha involved? The Volokh Conspiracy's Orin Kerr has the story here.
Meet Judge Wapner
Well, almost. That's how J. Craig Williams says he feels after sitting as judge pro tem
in a local court. Check out the four small claims cases he heard and his rulings.
Was justice served? Tell him here on May It Please The Court.
Bl**dy hilarious, your lordship!
Bill Heinze describes how Lord Sainsbury, U.K. Minister for Science & Innovation, outlined Britain's position on the EU Software Directive -- and how, reportedly, laughter from assembled software developers may have sped him back to the drawing board. On I/P Updates.
Boyfriend is a dirt bag
Following up on State of Washington v. Oliver C. Christensen -- as discussed here in "If only Mom would stick to searching my room"-- Michael Cernovich weighs in.
His conclusion: "Boyfriend is a dirt bag, but the Washington law protects his privacy. If you don't like it, write the legislature: Tell them to change the law.  But don't ask the Washington Supreme Court to reach an activist result." Don't miss his reader comments. On Crime & Federalism.

RING AROUND THE JURY, TMI AND WI-FI
"Ring around the jury?"
Once upon a time, a lawyer's colleagues recommended he wear a wedding ring in order to better impress juries. Only he wasn't married. So he asked The New York Times Magazine's ethicist, Randy Cohen, what do you think?
Today, blogger Carolyn Elefant weighs in with some additional, practical questions.
What do you think -- if the litigator wears the ring, is it deceitful or decorative? How about hair dye? Or assuming an accent? Comment here at MyShingle.com.
When TMI (too much information) is a good thing: Florida v. Nixon
Musing over Monday's 8-0 decision by the Supremes in Florida v. Nixon, Carolyn Elefant says you should document, document, document so it's not your word against the client's. She writes: "...any time there's a matter requiring client authorization - be it a settlement proposal or a controversial trial strategy, it makes sense to present the options to the client in writing and seek written approval before moving ahead."How to keep your pilot project aloft
The Common Scold has some recommended reading for law firms, particularly those beginning to embrace "project management" protocols. The case study: On-air Wi-Fi.
Oh, so those Abu Ghraib photographers can relax, then...
If the president signs the bill as expected, taking a photograph of a person's private parts without their consent will become a felony -- depending upon where it's taken, writes Michael Cernovich. The author of Crime & Federalism notes the exceptions, including prison work, here.

SIGNATURES, TRADEMARKS AND LAW GEEKS
Great. Is that guy litigating your divorce, too?
Once upon a time, a man was injured in a car accident away from the job. His employer had a plan that was designed to advance him money for accident-related expenses.
Only his attorney refused to sign an agreement that the plan would be reimbursed first if he won any compensation from the other party in the accident.
What's the end of the story? Did the man get his advance $$$ anyway? Did he win or lose his appeal to the 4th Circuit Court, in which his attorney argued that denying the benefits was wrong under ERISA?
Find out here on Jottings by an Employer's Lawyer.
What's in a name: Famous trademarks
Bill Heinze has two bookmarks for any brand marketer -- not to mention I/P attorneys:

ASHCROFT V. RAICH TRANSCRIPT, CERCLA AND RELIGION OTJ
Ashcroft v. Raich transcript now online
Courtesy of Blogger Randy Barnett, who does just a little Monday afternoon quarterbacking of his performance. Here on The Volokh Conspiracy.
Supremes and CERCLA
J. Craig Williams says the Supremes have rocked his world with today's decision in Cooper Industries v. Aviall Services. Read May It Please The Court for what he thinks this means for companies that planned to volunteer to clean up their land -- and sue former owners to share the costs. Here's Law.com's story, too.
Religion on the job
Jottings by an Employer's Lawyer on worship, work and how the two can collide:
This week: Confederate Southern American religion and the 3rd Circuit Court
Previous week: Church of Body Modification and the 1st Circuit Court
Workplace Fairness has a primer on religious discrimination here, behind their disclaimer.
Lani Guinier: "Nannygate" or "Quota queen"?
Today's pop-quiz: Do you remember why President Clinton abandoned Lani Guinier's nomination. Hint: Those who guess "nannygate" will earn severe punishment via public ridicule -- especially if they're a major news network.
To wit: Eugene Volokh points to a post that excoriates today's rash of media reports that Guinier's child care history scuttled her federal job. The Volokh Conspiracy blogfather wants your help either to correct media reports or to correct the blogger: "I express no views on whether Guinier's work was in fact misrepresented; but the rest of the item seems quite right to me. Unless there's something about the Guinier story that I had also missed -- and if there is, please let me know so that I can correct the post -- this seems like a nontrivial error by the media. They're not just wrong here, but they're wrong in a way that falsely accuses someone of violating the law. That doesn't speak well of their trustworthiness in other fields."$$$tratospheric rates and "stealth pro bono"
Following up on recent discussions about low hourly rates, Carolyn Elefant weighs in on the other end of the scale. "Can an hourly rate ever be excessive?" she asks.
Probably not if you're a solo and doing as much "stealth pro bono" as MyShingle.com's author surmises.
CRM for lawyers
"Gobble, gobble," says Monica Bay, in a long post on Lexis-Nexis' acquisition of Interface and its customer relationship management software. Her headline's a nod to Wolters Kluwers' recent acquisition of Summation Legal Technologies.
Bay says, "use of CRM software  is pretty much a litmus test as to the firms that are moving to a "corporate" model of operation, from the traditional "eat what you kill" mode of operation..." What do you think? Tell The Common Scold.

EAVESDROPPING MOMS, BLAKELY AND UNCIVIL CIVILITY
If only Mom would stick to searching my room...
Once upon a time, a mother listened in on her daughter's conversation with a boyfriend. When Mom learned Boyfriend had committed a crime, she turned him in -- and testified against him. Then what happened? Hint: Don't assume parents get a pass from federal wiretapping laws if they're acting to protect their children.
Here's the rest of the story as J. Craig Williams sees it on May It Please The Court.
Blakely's future decided today?
How does Blakely v. Washington apply to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines? The Volokh Conspiracy's resident criminal law geek, Orin Kerr, says he's among the attorneys who are wondering whether the Supremes will hand down their decision today, via United States v. Booker and United States v. Fanfan. More here.
Over at Crime & Federalism, Michael Cernovich notes that crim law blogs have exploded in the past six months and provides a terrific guide.
From one lawyer to another: @*$%!! I've reached a point where I'd rather go up against an attorneys who let off steam every so often with a stream of profanity but let me know clearly where they stand rather than the attorneys who'll publicly smile and then turn around and stab me in the back.More Carolyn Elefant at this post, "A lawyer calls for civility."

Alleging age discrimination on Capitol Hill: How it's different
Check out Mike Fox's first impressions of an age discrimination lawsuit that former employee Rita Bastien brought against Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-Co.). Jottings by an Employer's Lawyer raises interesting details about the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 that I never knew. Think employees can sue members directly for violating one of the 11 employment laws wrapped into this act? Think members pay any settlements or fines out of their own budgets? Think again.
Patent freeware
I/P Updates is offering readers a free patent application form "Fee Transmittal for FY 2005" updated with last week's changes. Blogger Bill Heinze says the form's in edit-friendly PDF format, including automatic date entry, fee calculation and tabulation, and a saved file name footer for ease of use.

PICKERING PRICKLES, STORY PROBLEMS FOR LAWYERS
Pickering prickles -- and it ain't pretty
By now, most of you know that Judge Charles Pickering, frustrated since January in his attempts to sit on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, as nominated by President George W. Bush, has retired.
But he had a little something to say before he walked out the door, as Volokh Conspiracy blogger Orin Kerr points out. Pickering's "raw deal" aside, Kerr writes, "remarks like that don't help his legacy."
