Welcome to Children’s Wish Foundation International! We’re glad you’re here.
Volunteer with CWFI and touch the hearts of seriously ill children around the world! You are ideally suited to be an extra set of hands or share your professional expertise. From wish fulfillment to administrative tasks to public advocacy, your service allows CWFI to allocate more funds directly to our programs.
We are happy to work with good people who are passionate about making a difference in the lives of children*.
We encourage you to include your family, your community, your school, and your business. Some of our most successful volunteers have used this occasion as a team-building exercise or service project. If you or your group would like to volunteer, submit the form below. Let’s get to work!
*Your in kind donation of specific professional services may be tax deductible. Please consult your financial advisor about the rules for your industry.

Current Volunteer Opportunities
CWFI Programs
Photography: Register as a photographer and document the wish experience for a child through candid photos. To be matched with an active wish in your area, fill out the volunteer form and include a link to your online portfolio.
Hospital programs: Gather 2-3 people to host an on-site craft or holiday party for children in your area. Suggest your favorite hospital. CWFI provides volunteer guidelines and coordinates the event with the hospital. All supplies are provided.
CWFI Facilities
Landscaping: Weeding, mulching, and general tidying. We welcome your in-kind donation of mulch or plantings.
COMPLETE! Signage: Rehab the CWFI street and front entrance signs. A good power-wash and repainting should do the trick. We welcome your in-kind donation of primer or paint.
Roof: Scrape, prime, and paint the overhang on our roof. We welcome your in-kind donation of primer or paint.
Fundraisers
By organizing a fundraising event to benefit CWFI, you supply much-needed financial support and raise vital awareness for our mission. The options for your event are endless. Brainstorm. And have fun! For inspiration, visit our fundraising and events board on Pinterest.
Last But Not least: Many of our supporters display a CWFI donation box at their event, church, school, or business. Spare change adds up; every little bit helps.
