Miller Johnson’s Taxation Practice Group consists of highly-trained and well-seasoned attorneys, some who are also certified public accountants, who have earned their Legal Masters of Taxation, or who have substantial governmental experience representing the Internal Revenue Service or the United States in tax matters. Our attorneys have worked for, among others, the Office of Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Justice, and Big 4 CPA firms. Our tax attorneys practice in virtually all relevant tax sub-specialty areas.
Our tax attorneys regularly work with individuals, estates, and trusts in tax planning and compliance matters.    The Personal Taxation Practice Group also has extensive experience involving tax controversy and litigation matters, whether it be civil or criminal tax, at administrative agency levels or in court.
Among the matters we handle for individuals, estates and trusts are the following:
Income tax planning
Estates and trusts tax issues
Real estate tax issues, including 1031 transactions and work-outs
Individual, fiduciary and estate tax return preparation
Sales, exchanges and basis issues
Charitable private foundations and general charitable planning
Tax planning cuts across many areas of estate planning and probate administration. We advise clients about the estate, gift, generation-skipping, and income tax ramifications of their estate planning and probate administration alternatives. We also prepare tax returns, including federal estate and gift tax returns, state death tax computations, federal and state fiduciary income tax returns, and federal, state, and local individual income tax returns.
The tax laws change frequently in ways that affect estate planning. Therefore, we monitor legislative and administrative developments and regularly attend and speak at continuing legal education seminars.

We handle various administrative and litigation matters, including the following:
Civil tax procedures
Audits and other administrative proceedings
Appellate division protests and administrative appeals
Tax Court cases
District Court cases
Tax Tribunal cases
Court of Claims cases
Criminal tax matters
Investigations
Trials
