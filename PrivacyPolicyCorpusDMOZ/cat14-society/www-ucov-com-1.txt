Photo Policy
All photos used on this website, brochures, or other documentation are the property of University Covenant Church (UCC) unless otherwise noted. Including the images of our church family on our website or brochures can be a great way to motivate and encourage individuals to become more involved. It is also a helpful tool for guests who may be curious about what our events and activities are like. It is for these reasons that we feature personal photographs on UCC’s ucov.com website, brochures, and other documentation. However, we realize the importance of maintaining the privacy of the individual(s) pictured on this website, our brochures, or other documentation. To this end, UCC ensures:
The last name of a pictured individual is never published alongside a photograph (except for staff and leadership pages) on our web pages
Anyone listed as a contact will be an adult
No identifying information will be posted on the internet (see our privacy policy)
In the case of a group photo, first names may be mentioned, but we will not disclose which individuals are standing where in said photo (except for staff and leadership pages)
UCC reserves the right to amend this policy at any time.
Questions or concerns regarding this policy should be addressed to the site webservant or site maintainer.
