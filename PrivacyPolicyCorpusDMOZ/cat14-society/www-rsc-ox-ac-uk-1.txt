We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy and security of your personal information ('personal data').
Purpose of the policy
This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
We may update this policy at any time. Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal information.

Information about how we use your data if you are a student is covered in a separate policy which will be available on the University website.

When do we collect personal data?

When you visit our site we may also automatically collect technical information about your visit from your computer.
How do we use your data?
We process your data for one or more of the following reasons:
To provide you with the services or information you have requested, such as about courses that you have applied for or events you wish to attend, and for customer administration. This processing is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into a contract.
To provide you with marketing communications where we have your consent, such as on courses, seminars or newsletter in which you may be interested. We do this only where you have specifically indicated that you consent to receive such communications, for example, by ticking a box or through some other action, or by volunteering non-mandatory information. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at rsc@qeh.ox.ac.uk. In this event, we will stop any processing as soon as we can. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your withdrawal of consent.
To process your short course/study programme application.
For purposes arising from your use of this website, for example, to ensure that we understand how this site is used. This processing occurs because it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests in operating this website.
Change of Purpose
We will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose. Please note that there may be occasions where we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.
Sharing your data with third parties
All our third-party service providers (for example, Constant Contact, Eventbrite and Wufoo) are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies. We do not allow them to use your data for their own purposes. We permit them to process your data only for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Constant Contact Inc. (a subsidiary of The Endurance International Group, Inc.), Wufoo (a subsidiary of SurveyMonkey Inc.) and Eventbrite participate in and have certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. They are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view certifications, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list
We may also share your personal data with third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our site terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our site, our users, and others.
Where your data is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.
Where we store or use your data
We may store data collected by the website manually or electronically. The data is stored on our secure servers and/or in our premises within the UK.
There may be occasions when we transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for example, when we communicate with you using a cloud-based service provider that operates outside the EEA such as Constant Contact, Eventbrite and Wufoo (see above). Such transfers will only take place if one of the following applies:
the country receiving the data is considered by the EU to provide an adequate level of data protection;
the organisation receiving the data is covered by an arrangement recognised by the EU as providing an adequate standard of data protection, e.g. transfers to companies that are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield;
the transfer is governed by approved contractual clauses;
the transfer has your consent;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into that contract; or
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with another person, which is in your interests.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to the website and any transmission is at your own risk.
Third party websites
Our website contains links to and from various third party websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Retaining your personal data
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
Your rights
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a 'data subject access request'). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.
Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your data and it would not be possible to fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop. However, where you have consented to the processing (for example where you have asked us to contact you for marketing purposes) you can withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us at rsc@qeh.ox.ac.uk. In this event, we will stop the processing as soon as we can. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your withdrawal of consent and you may no longer be able to use the site in the same way as you did before.
If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or are dissatisfied with the way we have used your information, you should contact the University’s Information Compliance Team at data.protection@admin.ox.ac.uk. The same email address may be used to contact the University’s Data Protection Officer. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
If you remain dissatisfied, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office at https://ico.org.uk/concerns.
