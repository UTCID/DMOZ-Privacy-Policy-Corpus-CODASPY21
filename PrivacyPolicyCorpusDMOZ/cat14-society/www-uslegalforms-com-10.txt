Overview
Why a Codicil to Will is Needed
A codicil to will is an important form if you need to make a change to a pre-existing will. Any amendment to will should be made properly. Some people think it's okay to merely cross out or add new text to an existing will, but this can create major problems and lead to will contests in court. It's vital that a properly drafted sample codicil to will is used whenever you need to make a change to a will form. A codicil to a will must follow the same legal formalities as a will, such as signing the codicil form with a clear mind in front of witnesses.

What is a Codicil Form For Will Used For?
A codicil for will form is used to make an amendment to will. A codicil is used to modify, add, or delete information in a will. The will form stays in effect, with the changes in the codicil combined with it. Codicils should be used when a minor change is needed, if there are major changes to be made, the original will should be replaced with a new will form. The following are some examples of the type of amendment to a will that a codicil may be used for:
Error correction - A codicil may be appropriate when there's a minor error, such as a typographical error or mistaken description of property.
Add or delete a bequest - If you no longer own property in a will or have newly acquired property and want to create a new gift, a will codicil can be advantageous.
Name a new executor - Perhaps your former executor is no longer able to serve, or you want to change the name used due to a divorce or marriage.
When to Use a New Will Template
Will codicil forms are best for making minor changes to a will. If you have a major change, or have already created a number of codicils, then creating a new will from scratch is preferable. There is no precise definition of what a minor or major change is. Some examples of a major change that would call for writing a new will template, rather than using a codicil to a will, include:
1.	Adding a new spouse as a beneficiary.
2.	Disinheriting an heir.
3.	Deciding to leave your estate to a charity instead of family members.
A codicil to a will can be easily completed from the privacy of your computer, so before you think of marking up a will form with changes, download a codicil for will sample to follow proper estate planning methods and avoid probate problems.
