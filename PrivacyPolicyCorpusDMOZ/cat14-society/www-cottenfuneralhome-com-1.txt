History
Cotten Funeral Home began not as a funeral home, but as a firm known as the Joe K. Willis Company, a local tombstone maker. The exact dates of when the firm was founded are unknown, but it began well before the turn of the century and has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years.
From tombstone maker to funeral home
The grandson of Joe K. Willis and Albert Willis Jr. formed a partnership with Frank Ballard to create a business that became known as Willis & Ballard Funeral Home. Albert went on to become a history teacher and never returned to work at his funeral home. He eventually sold his part of the company to his partner, Frank.
New owners take over the firm
Through the years, the funeral home changed owners again. Eventually Tommy Best and Billy Dowdy became partners in the funeral home. The new owners continued to operate under the name Willis & Ballard Funeral Home. During these years, the funeral home operated a public ambulance service along with its funeral home operations. Billy eventually sold his part of the partnership to Tommy. At this point in the funeral home’s history, it was relocated from what is now known as the Pugh Building in downtown New Bern to its current location at 2201 Neuse Blvd.
The Cotten family purchases the business
A while later, Russ Conner purchased part of the business and became a partner in the company. In March 1970, the funeral home was sold to R.L. Cotten Sr. and R.L. Cotten Jr. The name of the business was then changed to Cotten Funeral Home. The Cottens actively operated the funeral home until September 1, 1978. At that time, the business was sold to James Ray Odham Sr. He had been a funeral director and embalmer of the funeral home for many years. In 1981, Eastern Carolina Crematory was added on site at the funeral home.
A century of funeral service
Today, we are members of the Dignity Memorial network of funeral, cremation and cemetery providers. After more than 100 years of service, we continue to grow, evolve and provide quality service to families in New Bern and the surrounding areas.

"Yes! Rex made a difficult experience so much more bearable with his kind and gentle guidance and accommodating spirit. He was wonderful from start to finish and we are so blessed to have had him help us, not only with the arrangements, but also by speaking at our service. He made everything so personal. Even our neighbors commented that even though they didn't really know Barbara, they left feeling as if they had known her for years because of the stories that Rex shared.

"I live almost 3,000 miles away and they really helped me during this unexpected time of grief when my mother passed away. I had no idea what to do or how to handle anything. They assisted me in navigating everything from the paperwork, cremation arrangements, and even how to write the obituary and other questions about writing it. They were so patient and accommodating to me. I had so many questions and they were so patient with all my questions and concerns. I can't say enough good things about their service."

"Cotten Funeral Home deserves the highest recommendation possible! They were amazing â€” from the staff who prepared my mother and made her look so beautiful to the lovely presentation of the room and flowers for the visitation â€” every detail was perfect! Rex was also simply fantastic! We have known him for years and knew we could count on him to help us through this difficult time, just as he has several times before. He listened to our every request and found a way to make it happen. Most importantly, he spoke at the funeral and gave my mother the most personal and touching send off that we could have hoped for. We cannot thank him enough for all that he has done for our family! Please convey our appreciation to him!"

"Everyone at Cotten was so kind and helpful. Rex Bennett has been a dear friend of the family and has been there for our family through several deaths, including the deaths of all 3 of my Aunt Margie's adult children. This is something that no mother should have to go through but Rex helped and guided her through each of those services. Because of his tender, compassionate care Margie's last wishes were for Rex to take care of her when her time came ... and that is just what he did. We could have asked for things to have been handled any better!"
