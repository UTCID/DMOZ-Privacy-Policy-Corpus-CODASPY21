Use of the EU emblem by third parties
The principles of use of the EU emblem by third parties have been set out in an administrative agreement with the Council of Europe. This agreement has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 08/09/2012 (2012/C 271/04).
According to this agreement, any natural or legal person ("third-party user") may use the EU emblem or any of its elements, as long as this use
(a) does not create the impression or assumption that there is a connection between the third-party user and any of the institutions, bodies, offices, agencies and organs of the European Union or the Council of Europe where this connection does not exist;
(b) does not lead the public to believe that the user benefits from the support, sponsorship, approval or consent of any of the institutions, bodies, offices, agencies and organs of the European Union or the Council of Europe where this is not the case;
(c) is not made in connection with any objective or activity which is incompatible with the aims and principles of the European Union or the Council of Europe, or is otherwise unlawful.
If the use of the EU emblem complies with the above conditions, there is no need to ask for written permission.
Registration of the EU emblem, or a heraldic imitation thereof, as a trade mark or as any other IP right is not acceptable.
