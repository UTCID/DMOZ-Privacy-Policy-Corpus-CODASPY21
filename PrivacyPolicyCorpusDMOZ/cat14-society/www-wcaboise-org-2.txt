Case Management
There are many obstacles that victims have to overcome before they can be truly FREE of domestic violence. The WCA Bachelor’s level Case Managers and Interns provide assistance to victims as they work towards overcoming these obstacles.
Case Managers work one-on-one with clients to identify their strengths and barriers in order to develop a plan to achieve their goals.
Case Managers address barriers in the following areas:
Health Care Services (e.g. Medicaid)
Education
Employment
Basic Needs
Financial Empowerment
Housing
Transportation
Finances
Children’s Services
Case Managers also teach  classes, help clients learn to budget, write resumes, fix nutritious meals on a budget and be assertive in asking for help. For clients who are involved with Child Protective Services or have probation officers, the Case Managers assist with plan coordination to reduce barriers to clients’ successes.
In addition, Case Managers facilitate a number of group sessions that are provided to residential clients. Group sessions include life skills, nurturing parenting and a kid’s group in childcare.
Life Skills is designed to build skills around resume building, job searching, women’s health, landlord/tenant rights, safety with technology, and so much more. Nurturing Parenting is an evidence-based curriculum that teaches strategies and techniques to help parents improve the parent-child relationship, including how to enhance empathy to discipline with dignity. The kid’s group is modeled from the same nurturing parenting curriculum and is designed to model the same techniques that are being taught to the parents in nurturing parenting.
Additionally, Case Managers also help facilitate some of the Group Sessions offered to residential clients.
We take serious precautions to protect your confidentiality. To learn more, read our Privacy Policy. If you are interested in our case management services, call our 24-hour Crisis Hotline 208.343.7025.
