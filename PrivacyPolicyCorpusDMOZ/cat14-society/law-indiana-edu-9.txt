HomeAcademicsCybersecurity programsInformation privacy certificateInformation privacy certificateGraduate certificate in information privacy law and policyTechnological developments increasingly pose new challenges to privacy in various contexts from business to law enforcement to social interactions. Experts in information privacy law and policy are needed to determine how our legal system should properly balance these often-competing interests.The explosive growth in digital technologies and applications has led to hundreds of new information privacy laws in the United States and internationally. Compliance with these laws, management of privacy in areas not yet regulated by law, resolving conflicts among privacy laws, and articulating new privacy laws and policies have led to the creation and rapid expansion of information privacy law careers throughout the private and public sectors at the local, national, and international levels. There is a growing need for individuals with formal background in information privacy law and policy to both understand the current regulations and to thoughtfully develop new information privacy law and policy frameworks as technological developments continually disrupt prior conceptions of privacy.The Maurer School of Law and Indiana University Bloomington are uniquely placed to answers these demands because of deep and broad experience in education and research on cybersecurity and information privacy. Recognized by the federal government as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE) and National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R), IU's cybersecurity and information privacy programs are distinguished by their interdisciplinary approach, including integration of law, business, and computer science.The Information Privacy Law and Policy Certificate can be earned on campus in Bloomington or online from anywhere in the world.
