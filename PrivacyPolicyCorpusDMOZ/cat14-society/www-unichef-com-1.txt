"We're Chefs.... not
Telemarketers!"
This is how we will handle information we
learn about you from your visit to
"www.unichef.com"
We collect and store the following general
information about your visit: the name
of
the domain from which you access the
Internet
(for example, aol.com, if you are coming
from an America Online account, the
date
and time you access our site, and the
Internet
address of the website from which you
linked
directly to our site, your Operating
System
and Browser.
We use this information to measure
the number
of visitors to the different sections
of
our site, and to help us make our site
more
useful. We use the Browser information
to
develop and code content pages so that
most
people will be able to view the pages
correctly.
When inquiries are E-Mailed to us,
we again
store the question and E-Mail address

so that we can answer the question
that was
sent in, and send the answer back to
the
E-Mail address provided. If enough
questions
or comments come in that are the same,
the
suggestions are used to guide the design
of our Web site.
We do not sell or otherwise distribute mailing
lists based on any information we receive.
Information solicited by us from our
visitors
in the form of surveys, questionnaires,
etc.,
is used solely to compile demographics
so
that we may understand the needs of
our audience.
