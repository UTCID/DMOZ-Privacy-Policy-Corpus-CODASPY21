A new book is giving Argentina a new reason not to cry for Eva Peron: She helped a number of Nazis who fled Europe after World War II, and was rumored to have harbored treasures taken from their Jewish victims.

Peron isn’t the book’s only target. It also alleges that Simon Bolivar’s “greatest fear was that blacks, Indians, and those of mixed race would take power.” Salvador Allende, meanwhile, is accused of installing a “project of socialist doctrination in schools,” and of considering a Nazi-inspired sterilization program.
