eco-usa: privacy policy
I'm told I'm supposed to have one of these, so here goes:
This privacy policy describes eco-usa.net's efforts to protect the privacy of site users.
eco-usa.net does not request that users submit any information to eco-usa.net. If you communicate with eco-usa.net (e.g., via email), it is because you want to. eco-usa.net may store messages received, and may respond to them, but does not have a responsibility to do so.
eco-usa.net does not use cookies. In the past, eco-usa.net used Google Analytics to track the number of visitors to the site and specific pages, and Google Analytics placed cookies on the computers of persons visiting eco-usa.net. However, eco-usa.net no longer uses Google Analytics.
Other than e-mails sent by you because you want to, eco-usa.net does not receive or use any information from you. eco-usa.net will not release any of your information (e.g., emails) that it may possess, unless (1) required by law to do so, or (2) you grant us explicit permission to post a message on the eco-usa.net website as a testimonial. Neither of these circumstances has occurred to date.
