1. Introduction
This privacy notice (“notice”) applies to the processing of personal data by Linklaters in connection with any:
“client services”: provision of products and services by Linklaters to actual and prospective clients;
“supplier services”: provision of products and services to Linklaters by suppliers or service providers;
“visitor services”: provision by Linklaters of facilities, including conference rooms, local area networking (for instance, WiFi) and other relevant facilities and services to visitors to any Linklaters’ offices; and
“recruitment activities”: provision of the personal data of a candidate or individual (whether by such candidate or individual or by a third party, such as a recruitment agency) for a position at Linklaters other than through Linklaters’ usual recruitment process.
References in this notice to “you” or “your” are references to individuals whose personal data Linklaters processes in connection with client services, supplier services, or visitor services. For the avoidance of doubt:
any reference in this policy to our “clients” or “suppliers” includes their employees or other staff whose personal details we process;
this privacy notice also applies to Linklaters’ processing of personal data of individuals who could be (or could be the employees or staff of) transaction counterparties or rival bidders to, or litigants in legal proceedings involving, our actual or prospective clients; and
if you have provided your personal data to Linklaters for recruitment activities (whether directly or through a third party) this notice is only designed to provide you with information about how we will process your personal data up to the point that you apply for a position or placement with Linklaters. Details of the processing undertaken for recruitment activities are set out in Clause 15. If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data for recruitment purposes please contact data.protection@linklaters.com and we will direct you to our recruitment privacy notice.
References in this notice to “Linklaters”, “we”, “us” or “our” are references to Linklaters LLP and the other “Linklaters BCR Group Entities” (as defined in and listed in schedule 2 of our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”), which can be found on our website here). Linklaters LLP is a limited liability partnership established under English law whose registered office is at One Silk Street, London EC2Y 8HQ, England.
2. Importance of personal data protection
We recognise that the use and disclosure of personal data has important implications for us and for the individuals whose personal data we process. Most of our offices operate in countries which regulate the use, and impose restrictions on overseas transfers, of personal data. To ensure that we handle personal data properly, we have adopted a global approach to privacy compliance, as evidenced by our BCRs. A copy of our BCRs is available on our website at the address provided above. Alternatively, you can request a copy of our BCRs at any time by contacting us at data.protection@linklaters.com.
Our privacy notice is available here. You can request a copy of this notice at any time by contacting us at data.protection@linklaters.com.
3. Purpose of this notice
This notice aims to give you information about how Linklaters collects and processes your personal data. It is important that you read this notice together with any other notices we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing your personal data, so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your personal data. This notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.
This notice can be accessed on our website but is not our website privacy notice or our cookie notice. Our website privacy notice and our cookie notice are accessible from the privacy section of our website here.
4. Who is the controller for the personal data processed?
A “controller” is a person or organisation who alone or jointly determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is, or is likely to be, processed. This notice is issued on behalf of Linklaters LLP as controller. Unless we notify you otherwise Linklaters LLP is the controller for your personal data.
Our Global Head of Regulatory Compliance oversees compliance with data protection within Linklaters. If you have any questions about this notice, including any requests to exercise your rights, please contact our Global Head of Regulatory Compliance using the contact details set out below:

5. How to make a complaint about the use of your personal data by us
If you have any concerns or would like to make a complaint about our processing of your personal data, please refer to our Global Data Protection Complaints Procedure, which is available on the privacy section of our website here. You may raise your concerns with your local data protection authority directly, without going through our Global Data Protection Complaints Procedure. However, we would encourage you to contact us in the first instance as we aim to promptly, efficiently and satisfactorily resolve any concerns or complaints you may have in relation to Linklaters’ processing of your personal data.

This can mean, for instance, that it is in our interest, to monitor how you are using any client portals or access to systems to ensure that the security of such portals or systems is maintained. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests; and
“consent and explicit consent”: where you have provided your consent or explicit consent to processing your personal data.
We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us at data.protection@linklaters.com.
With limited exceptions (for instance, in relation to some of our electronic marketing), generally we do not rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your personal data. You have the right to withdraw consent to electronic marketing at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions in such marketing materials or by contacting us at marketing.database@linklaters.com. Please refer to Section 16 (Marketing and exercising your right to opt-out of marketing) for more information about how we use your personal data for marketing purposes and your rights.

"CCTV data" will be used for the following purposes: detection and prevention of crime; detection and prevention of safety incidents; detection and prevention of unauthorised access to Linklaters’ premises and restricted areas; detection and prevention of gross misconduct; supporting safety, security and internal investigations; supporting criminal investigations; and for reviewing security & safety incidents, including security training exercises. On rare occasions, covert CCTV may be used to meet these purposes. Processing CCTV data for the aforementioned purposes is necessary for the purposes of Linklaters’ legitimate interests.
12. Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it as detailed in Section 10 (How we use your personal data) and Section 11 (Purposes and legal basis for which we will use your personal data), unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to receive an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at data.protection@linklaters.com.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
13. How we use personal data relating to other individuals collected from you
On certain occasions, in the course of our client services, you may provide us with personal data of individuals who are not aware of our involvement or of our processing of their personal data (for instance, personal data of employees of the target in a corporate acquisition in which you are the purchaser). In such situations, we are likely to not have direct contact with individuals whose personal data we are processing, or it may for other reasons (for instance, to maintain confidentiality) not be appropriate for us to provide them with a privacy notice setting out how we process their personal data. Before you pass any such personal data to us, you must therefore ensure that the relevant individuals have received any requisite privacy notices in connection with the performance of our client services.
14. Processing your personal data if you are not our client
If you are not our client, we may need to process your personal data in order to provide client services to our client, including the provision of legal advice. This personal data may be provided to us through the course of the matter for example, provided to us as part of a disclosure process or provided by another third party. Where this is the case your personal data may be used in legal proceedings on behalf of our client.
We will process your personal data in these circumstances as:
this is in our legitimate interests, our client’s legitimate interests or those of another third party; and/or
we may be required to process that personal data to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
If you have any questions about how we will process your personal data please contact us at data.protection@linklaters.com or using the contact details in Section 4.
15. Processing your personal data for recruitment activities
When your personal data is passed to us for recruitment activities, we will only use this personal data in order to contact you about recruitment and other opportunities which may you have requested. If you apply for any role within Linklaters for example a position or vacation scheme your personal data will be processed in accordance with our recruitment privacy notice which can be obtained by contacting us at data.protection@linklaters.com.
16. Marketing and exercising your right to opt-out of marketing
We will not use your personal data to send you marketing materials if you have requested not to receive them. If you request that we stop processing your personal data for marketing purposes, we shall stop processing your personal data for those purposes.
We would encourage you to make such requests via the forms and links provided for that purpose in the marketing materials we send you or by contacting our Marketing team at marketing.database@linklaters.com. You may alternatively make any such request to your usual contact at the firm or to the Global Head of Regulatory Compliance (using the contact details set out in Section 4). In any event, such request can be made at any time free of charge.
17.	Third-party marketing
We do not share your personal data with any organisations outside of Linklaters for marketing purposes.
18. Disclosures of your personal data
We may have to share your personal data with the entities and persons set out below for the purposes for which we collected the personal data, as detailed in Section 10 (How we use your personal data) and Section 11 (Purposes and legal basis for which we will use your personal data).
Your personal data will be shared within Linklaters between the Linklaters BCR Group Entities (which are listed in schedule 2 of our BCRs, accessible on our website here). As an international firm, we share your personal data between Linklaters offices to ensure the efficient operation of our firm (for instance, by sourcing our shared services in the most cost-effective way) and to provide the highest quality of client services. Your personal data is shared in accordance with our BCRs.
Where required, we will (subject to our professional obligations and any terms of business which we may enter into with you) disclose your personal data to:
(i)	any person or entity to whom we are required or requested to make such disclosure by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any governmental, taxation or other regulatory authority, law enforcement agency or similar body (for example, the Solicitors Regulation Authority or the Law Society in the United Kingdom);
(ii)	our professional advisers or consultants, including lawyers, bankers, auditors, accountants and insurers providing consultancy, legal, banking, audit, accounting or insurance services to us;
(iii)	any financial institutions providing finance to us;
(iv)	service providers who provide information technology and system administration services to us; and
(v)	any external auditors who may carry out independent checks of your file as part of our accreditations.
If you ask us to do so in relation to the client services or visitor services we are providing or the supplier services you are providing, we may disclose your personal data to other persons or entities as instructed (for example, if we are acting for you in litigation proceedings, we will share your personal data with barristers or external counsel or advisors in order to provide advice to you).
We may share your personal data with persons or entities outside of Linklaters to whom we may sell or transfer parts of our business or assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, the part of our business that is (as the case may be) sold, acquired or is the merged entity may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this notice. If applicable, we will update our BCRs to reflect any such changes to the Linklaters BCR Group Entities.
We may share your personal data with persons or entities outside of Linklaters for the purposes of obtaining feedback or references in relation to client services provided to you. For example, we may share your corporate contact details with legal directories for the purpose of obtaining a reference in relation to client services provided to you. Where appropriate, we will confirm with you that you are willing to be contacted for this purpose.
We require any person or entity to whom we disclose personal data pursuant to this Section 18 to respect the confidentiality and security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We do not allow such recipients of your personal data to use it for their own purposes, and we only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
19. International transfers
When we share your personal data within Linklaters LLP, this involves transferring your personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The personal data is shared in accordance with our BCRs, which require all Linklaters entities to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. A copy of our BCRs is accessible on our website here. Alternatively, you can request a copy of our BCRs at any time by contacting us at data.protection@linklaters.com.
In some cases, the parties who we use to process personal data on our behalf are based outside the EEA, therefore their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of such data outside the EEA. Similarly, in the course of advising clients based outside of the EEA, we may be required to share matter-relevant personal data with them. Where this is the case we will only share the minimal amount of personal data necessary for the purpose of processing and, where possible, we will share the personal data in an anonymised form.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; and
where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which gives personal data the same protection it has within the EEA.
Please contact us at data.protection@linkaters.com if you would like further information about the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
20. Data security
Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, including:
the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and
a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
We ensure that those who have permanent or regular access to personal data, or that are involved in the processing of personal data, or in the development of tools used to process personal data, are trained and informed of their rights and responsibilities in when processing personal data.
21. Data retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. This includes for example the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, reporting requirements, to carry out legal work, for the establishment or defence of legal claims.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
If you would like to know more about the retention periods we apply to your personal data, please contact us at data.protection@linkaters.com.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
22. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. It is Linklaters policy to respect your rights and Linklaters will act promptly and in accordance with any applicable law, rule or regulation relating to the processing of your personal data.
Details of your rights are set out below:
right to be informed about how personal data is used – you have a right to be informed about how we will use and share your personal data. This explanation will be provided to you in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible format and will be written in clear and plain language;
right to access personal data – you have a right to obtain confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data, access to your personal data and information regarding how your personal data is being used by us;
right to have inaccurate personal data rectified – you have a right to have any inaccurate or incomplete personal data rectified. If we have disclosed the relevant personal data to any third parties, we will take reasonable steps to inform those third parties of the rectification where possible;
right to have personal data erased in certain circumstances – you have a right to request that certain personal data held by us is erased. This is also known as the right to be forgotten. This is not a blanket right to require all personal data to be deleted. We will consider each request carefully in accordance with the requirements of any laws relating to the processing of your personal data;
right to restrict processing of personal data in certain circumstances – you have a right to block the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This right arises if you are disputing the accuracy of personal data, if you have raised an objection to processing, if processing of personal data is unlawful and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead or if the personal data is no longer required by us but you require the personal data to be retained to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;
right to data portability – in certain circumstances you can request to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used electronic format. This right only applies to personal data that you have provided to us (for example by completing a form or providing information through a website). Information about you which has been gathered by monitoring your behaviour will also be subject to the right to data portability. The right to data portability only applies if the processing is based on your consent or if the personal data must be processed for the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means (i.e. electronically);
right to object to processing of personal data in certain circumstances, including where personal data is used for marketing purposes – you have a right to object to processing being carried out by us if (a) we are processing personal data based on legitimate interests or for the performance of a task in the public interest (including profiling), (b) if we are using personal data for direct marketing purposes, or (c) if information is being processed for scientific or historical research or statistical purposes. You will be informed that you have a right to object at the point of data collection and the right to object will be explicitly brought to your attention and be presented clearly and separately from any other information; and
right not to be subject to automated decisions where the decision produces a legal effect or a similarly significant effect – you have a right not to be subject to a decision which is based on automated processing where the decision will produce a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on you.
You may exercise any of your rights at any using the contact details set out in Section 4. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month. Occasionally it may take us longer than one calendar month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
