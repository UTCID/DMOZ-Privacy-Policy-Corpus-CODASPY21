Data Collection & Privacy
Data Collection & Privacy
More and more, in its efforts to combat crime and ensure national security, the government is engaging in a process called data mining, which uses highly sophisticated computing technology to comb through large amounts of data.  While data mining can be a valuable tool, it also raises significant free speech, privacy, and equal protection concerns.  Moreover, in the last decade, the federal government has encouraged state and local law enforcement to cooperate in data collection and exchange through “fusion centers,” information-sharing hubs for federal, state, local and tribal governments. The Constitution Project’s Liberty and Security Committee proposes policies and procedures that allow the government to tap into this vast sea of information to preserve our collective security, while simultaneously protecting the constitutionally-guaranteed privacy and due process rights of its citizens.
