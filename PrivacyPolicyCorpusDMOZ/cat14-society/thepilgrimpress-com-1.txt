This privacy policy explains the privacy practices of the National Setting of the United Church of Christ (“the UCC”) as applied through thepilgrimpress.com and how the UCC treats your information that is gathered through thepilgrimpress.com.
This policy only applies to information we collect from visitors to our website, thepilgrimpress.com.  This policy does not apply to information collected by the UCC offline, through any other website maintained by the UCC, or through any other means, or from any third party.  Please read this privacy policy carefully.  You acknowledge that it is part of our terms and conditions.  If you do not agree, you must not access thepilgrimpress.com, use any of the content found on thepilgrimpress.com, or make any purchases from thepilgrimpress.com.

The UCC uses your information to present our website and its contents to you; to communicate with you via emails to which you subscribe; to fulfill contracts, in particular, facilitating and processing purchases and related transactions; and where it is necessary to fulfill the UCC’s legitimate interests, which include operating our website; providing information and goods and services described on our website; verifying your identity; determining how to improve our website; and responding to your questions and comments.
