Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
This privacy policy describes how Apostolic Christian Church Foundation, Inc. “ACCF” collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Web site: http://accfoundation.org. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
Information Collection and Use
Emails and Web Forms
From time to time we may collect information from users of our site.  Personal information that you provide by email or web forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information to you or respond to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, ACCF staff or its contractors may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level of interest in, or satisfaction with our services. We do not share or sell any personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.
The ACCF will provide you with a notification via prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in the control of your personal information.
Blog
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at YourACCF@gmail.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Service Providers (including Donations)
We use other third parties to process any and all online donations received (please see the link to ACS Technologies https://www.acstechnologies.com/company/privacy-policy).  These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for promotional purposes.
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
If you do nothing during your visit but browse through our website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically using cookies and log files. We use this information to help make our site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site, and the types of technology they use.
Log Files
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base. We do not link this automatically collected data to personal information.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
ACCF uses cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out here (or if located in the European Union, here.) Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Legal Disclaimer
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information, as well as personal information we process as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.
