What information we gather during your visit
Information we gather for anonymous browsing:
We automatically collect certain information from you when you visit arXiv. This data is used to gather metrics on site usage including geographic location of visitors (IP address), pathways navigated through the website, what type of internet browser is used (user-agent). No attempt is made to deanonymize information we collect.

In order to take full advantage of some of our services, including article submission, we may request name, email, username, ORCID, past emails, affiliation, country, additional contact information and/or online identifiers. We may also request a record of affiliation and publication record be provided via email. When a user submits an article to arXiv we also collect author names, affiliation of co-authors (if provided), submitter IP address and submitter remote host.
Information associated with your user account can be viewed on your user dashboard.
Information you may provide when submitting feedback or help request:
Users who email arXiv administrators for technical help or moderation requests should include information relevant to the request.
