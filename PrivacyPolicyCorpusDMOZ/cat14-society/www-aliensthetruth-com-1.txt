About Us
We are dedicated to providing information on UFO sightings, alien incidents, world mysteries, and other paranormal activity.
There are so many cases where governments, individuals, or groups of people are involved in incidents involving an aliens or UFOs. Some instances have been very well publicized while others have not. We believe that given the incredible frequency with which alien/UFO sightings occur that there is a distinct possibility that extraterrestrial life exists. It is up to individuals to try and get governments to release the information they have on UFOs/aliens. The truth is out there!
