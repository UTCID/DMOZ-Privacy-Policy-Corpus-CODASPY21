Ofsted is the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills. They are responsible for regulating and inspecting schools in order to achieve excellence in the care of children and young people, and in education and skills for learners of all ages.
Latest Inspection
In March 2018, Ofsted visited Our Lady & St Chad Catholic Academy to carry out a full inspection.
Upon completion they reported that outcomes for students and the quality of teaching, learning and assessment are both good. They judged the overall effectiveness of the school to be good.
You can view our full inspection report on the Ofsted website.
Parent View
Parent View gives you the chance to tell Ofsted what you think about the school. Parent View asks for your opinion on twelve aspects of the school, from the quality of teaching, to dealing with bullying and poor behaviour. By sharing your views, you’ll be helping the school to improve. You can also see how other parents have rated the school’s performance.
