ENOUGH ISENOUGHBE ALERTMOVE OVER
AAST Partners with Thin Blue Line USA
Thin Blue Line USA (thinbluelineusa.com) partnered with AAST to promote awareness of the continuing dangers and devastation America's state troopers face while performing their job on the side of the road. Thin Blue Line USA has donated over $500,000 to causes supporting law enforcement. Their sticker campaign will continue their ongoing mission and help raise awareness of our troopers being hit, injured, and killed on duty.
ENOUGH is ENOUGH Be Alert Move Over. Stickers can be purchased on their website with a percentage of proceeds being donated to the AAST Foundation.
AAST fully supports this worthwhile endeavor to bring awareness to one of the most dangerous aspects of our job! Mason Dixon Polling also supports this awareness as they indicate in a National poll shows strong support (89%) for Move Over laws. Despite laws in all 50 states, 30% of Americans are unaware their state has them and 67% aren’t aware of the branded phase Move Over.
From Our Members
"Your gift helped further my education and allowed me to follow in the footsteps of family members before me. My grandfather, Captain Joe F. Dixon (retired), served the Florida Highway Patrol for 39 years and my father. Major Jeffrey S. Dixon, has been on patrol for the past 25 years. My family has been in FHP for several decades and I graduated in the 137th FHP Academy class in 2017.
I know AAST Supports the education of troopers and their dependants through scholarship opportunities, and I am truly grateful to be a recipient. Man's flight through life is supported by the power of his knowledge and your gift will certainly help me sustain my educational and professional goals. As a part of a trooper's family, this opportunity means a great deal to me and my family. Thank you to everyone at AAST and to my fellow troopers and retirees across the country who support the scholarship program."
