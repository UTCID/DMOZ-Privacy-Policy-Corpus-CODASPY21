EEO/Affirmative Action Policy
Moses & Singer  is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer.  It is the continuing policy of the Firm to promote equal employment opportunities through a positive program of specific practices.  It is the policy of the Firm to recruit, hire, promote, compensate and administer all employment practices and benefit programs without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, citizenship status, age, marital status, veteran status, actual or perceived disability or handicap, or any protected category under federal, state or local law or known association or relationship with a person within any of the aforementioned protected categories.  The Firm’s affirmative action/equal opportunity policy shall include, but not be limited to recruitment, hiring, placement, compensation, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, layoff and termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment.  If an employee believes he or she has been subjected to discriminatory treatment in violation of this policy, the employee should promptly speak to the Director of Human, Managing Partner, a member of the Management Committee or the Firm’s General Counsel, as he or she deems to be appropriate.
The Firm will reaffirm to those staff members responsible for recruitment, selection and promotion that they are expected and required to implement the Firm’s affirmative action/equal employment policy.  Additionally, the Firm emphasizes the need for special efforts in the recruitment, hiring, training, promotion and retention of women and minorities, particularly in areas where underutilization exists.
