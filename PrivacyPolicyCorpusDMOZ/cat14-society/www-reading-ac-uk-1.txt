Automatic Data Collection
We collect personal information about website (s) usage through cookies (see the section on Cookies, Google Analytics and third party cookies below) and server logs, which track the IP addresses of users visiting our site and the pages they visit.
Information collected via the University's server logs includes users' IP addresses and the web pages visited; this will be used to manage the web system and troubleshoot problems.
The University also uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") to understand how visitors engage with our website and so We can improve it. See the section on Google Analytics below.
Cookies
Cookies are text files placed on your computer to help us analyse how users use our site. A cookie is a small data file able to track the online movements of an individual. This information could potentially be used to build an online profile of individuals and uniquely locate them in the world.
We use different types of cookies. Some are essential or necessary for the functioning or security of our websites, some analytics cookies are used to help Us to measure the performance of our websites and some are used by Us and third parties to deliver targeted advertising and marketing across other sites that you visit or interact with.
Essential/Necessary/Functional Cookies
An example of these cookies are those that allocate your 'session ID'. This allows our server to recognise your computer and 'remember' what you've done on the site. The benefits of this are:
You only need to log in once if you're navigating secure areas of the site
You are able to use interactive elements of the site, such as forms
Our server can distinguish between your computer and other users, so you can see the information that you have requested.
Performance/Analytics Cookies
An example of these cookies is Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics to help us to understand how you make use of our content and work out how we can make things better. These cookies follow your progress through our website, collecting data on where you have come from, which pages you visit, and how long you spend on the site. This data is then stored by Google in order to create reports. These cookies do not store your personal data.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website, including your IP address, may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
The Google website contains further information about Analytics and a copy of Google's privacy policy pages.
Other parts of the University's website also store cookies on your computer to track user traffic patterns. We do this to see how the website is used, to determine page popularity, to help security and for general statistical purposes. Some of this information may be held on servers in locations outside the EEA. Where personally identifying information is involved, data will only be held in locations that are deemed to have adequate protections for personal data.
Marketing/Advertising/Third Party Cookies
Some cookies are dropped by parties external to the University, such as social media platforms. These enable the sharing of content via these channels and can also be used to track your interactions with sites visited and use this information to display targeted advertising and marketing to you.
For further information on cookies, including how you can see what cookies have been set and control cookies within your browser visit www.allaboutcookies.org or www.aboutcookies.org.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to refuse cookies that are stored on your computer; the above websites tell you how to do this.
