YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION, CONTENT OR MATERIALS.
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE ACTIVITIES OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY USER OF THE SITE.
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR ANY OF OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE BY ANY USER ON ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SITE, OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR EMAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE. The limitation of liability contained herein shall be enforced even if all other remedies fail of their essential purpose.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THAT OF OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Email and Electronic Transmission of Information
You understand that the Internet is public and that e-mail communications and electronic transmission of information between you and the Center for Workforce Inclusion, or between you and any other user via this website are subject to the risk of being viewed by other parties. Accordingly, you agree not to transmit confidential or proprietary information relating to you or your business to the Center or to other users via e-mail.
Violation of Rules and Regulations
The Center reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of the rules and regulations set forth in this website, including the right to block access from a particular Internet address to the website.
Governing Law and General Provisions
This website is operated by the Center for Workforce Inclusion from the State of Maryland within the United States of America. The Center makes no representation that the information in the website is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to the website from territories where the contents of the website may be illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access this website from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. Any claims relating to the information available on this website will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland excluding the application of its conflicts of law rules. You hereby consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction in the courts of the State of Maryland with regard to any proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or your use of or access to the website. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms of Use set forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Center may post supplemental terms and conditions regarding privacy and user information on this website, which shall become binding upon users if and when such additional terms and conditions are posted.
Miscellaneous
We may be required by state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on the Site or delivering them to you through e-mail. If you do not provide us with accurate contact information, we cannot be held liable if we fail to notify you.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements that you may have with us.
If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in effect.
