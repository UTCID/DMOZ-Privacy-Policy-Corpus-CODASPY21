This Privacy Policy applies to the Sites only. Our Sites includes links to other websites. If you submit personally identifying information to any of those sites, your information is subject to their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
With Whom does the Company share my information?
We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. These are some of the ways that your information may be disclosed:
Government Partners
We make available your personally identifiable information and other information collected through the Site to the government partner with which we have contracted to provide services on the Site.
Service Providers
We may provide your personally identifying information to companies that provide services to us (such as web hosting providers, call center service providers, sweepstakes vendors, payment processors, data enhancement, or fraud prevention providers) or that help us market and provide our products and services. These third parties are authorized to use your personally identifying information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Data in the Aggregate
We may disclose “blinded” aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties. Blinded data is data that does not identify an individual person.
Other
We also may disclose your information in special cases. For example, we may disclose such information (1) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, (2) when a governmental unit is investigating activity on the Site or (3) we believe that we must disclose information to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions of use, or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other websites users or customers and their information, or anyone else who may be harmed by such activities. The Company and our service providers may disclose, access or monitor your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services and our information security.
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or assets. In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of Company’s businesses, customer and website visitor information may be one of the transferred assets and may be disclosed in connection with negotiations relating to a proposed transaction. In such case, the transferred information may become subject to a different privacy policy.
We may also share your information at your direction or request, or with your express permission.
How can I control my personal information?
To review and update your personally identifying information to ensure it is accurate, you may log into the Gov2Go® Pay payment service and edit your information, or you may contact us at legal@egov.com with any questions. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you reasonable access to any of your personally identifying information we maintain within 30 days of your access request. We provide this access so you can review it, make corrections or request deletion of your data. If we cannot honor your request within the 30-day period, we will tell you when we will provide access. In the unlikely event that we cannot provide you access to this information, we will explain why we cannot do so.

How do We Respond to Do Not Track Signals?
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers to signal their preference regarding potential "tracking" by third party websites.  While the United States Federal Trade Commission has endorsed DNT, our Sites do not currently support DNT codes.  However, except as otherwise disclosed herein, our Sites limit tracking to the internal uses described above.  Our Sites do not track your use across multiple websites, however, other websites to which we link may.  Please review their privacy policies to understand how you may be tracked.
What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
Providing security for the personally identifying information you submit via our Sites is a priority for us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. However, no e-commerce solution, website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.
Children’s Personal Information
We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information online, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us at legal@egov.com.
What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose information online, that information is accessible to other customers and users. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
When you or we end your customer relationship with us, we will treat the information we have about you as if you were still our customer.
