Max Williams, Accredited Specialist in Wills & Estates, de Groots Wills and Estate Lawyers
“The Wills Days provide a way for me to use my legal skills to give back to the community by providing simple Wills to the public and helping the Salvos raise funds to support the great work they do in our local communities.”

Testimonials:
"Anywhere there was ever any problem or trouble the Salvos were there on the spot.
They would help and I used to think, "gosh that's good".
It became more and more obvious to me that the more someone could support The Salvation Army, the better."
Yvonne
Salvation Army supporter, Red Shield Appeal doorknock collector and Honoured Friend
"A young woman who had two small children arrived at a centre.
She had been in a bad relationship.
We supported her to get accommodation and then as an outreach client.
She went on to university study.
So the support from The Salvation Army definitely changed her life."
Salvo Elizabeth Wiggins
Honoured Friends Representative
"We decided that, as we are both in our 80s, it's going to cost us money to go into care so we can't give away large amounts of money while we're alive.
But there will be a significant amount left in our Wills."
