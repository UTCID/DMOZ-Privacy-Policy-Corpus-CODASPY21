Important information about our COVID-19 response.
During the pandemic, DuPagePads continues to follow best safety guidelines and provide Interim Housing
for persons experiencing homelessness through a combination of support services, hotel-based housing
and small-capacity congregate shelter. Housing evaluations for anyone without shelter are available
Monday – Friday from 8am – 12pm
via phone at 630-682-3846. Individuals and families
are asked contact the Client Service Center before seeking access at
Emergency Housing locations.
