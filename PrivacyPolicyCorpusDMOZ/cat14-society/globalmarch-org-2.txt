Policy Makers
Global March Against Child Labour (Global March) recognises the unique role that policy makers can play in ending child labour throughout the world, in their capacity as law makers as well as opinion leaders and representatives of common citizens. Global March engages Parliamentarians through its initiative ‘Parliamentarians Without Borders for Children’s Rights (PWB)’ that seeks to mobilise and strengthen the voices of law makers who are champions of child rights and engaged them constructively towards ending child labour, child trafficking and promoting quality education for all.
