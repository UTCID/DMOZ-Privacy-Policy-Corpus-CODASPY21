Policy Dialogues
In addition to the policy dialogues organized under our core programmes and focal cities initiatives, WIEGO organizes other policies dialogues.A policy dialogue involves people from different interest groups sitting together to focus on an issue in which they have a mutual, but not necessarily common, interest. It assumes that people in different positions and circumstances will have different perspectives on the same problem and that they may have access to different information and ideas about the issue.It serves to bridge the gaps in understanding by facilitating dialogue, and to achieve mutually-beneficial results.Conducting a Policy Dialogue to Achieve ResultsExamples of Policy DialoguesFormalizing the Informal Economy? – 2013: WIEGO hosted this event in Montevideo, Uruguay, which saw government officials and trade unionists talk with informal worker leaders.European Development Days Conference Panel – 2012: The European Commission and WIEGO co-hosted a panel on “The Perspective of the Working Poor in the Informal Economy” at the European Development Days conference in Brussels.
