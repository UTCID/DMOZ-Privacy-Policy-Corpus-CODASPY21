LEAP:  LACBA’s Entrepreneurial Assistance Program for Veterans
Welcome to LEAP
LACBA’s Entrepreneurial Assistance Program for Veterans
LACBA’s Veterans Legal Services Project announces an exciting new expansion to its services for veterans.  Through LEAP, we will offer legal education and legal assistance to veteran entrepreneurs to aid with small business development.
Nationally, LEAP partners with Syracuse’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families, and international law firms, to offer direct legal services to disabled veterans and women veteran graduates of two of Syracuse’s nationwide entrepreneur program for veterans. LEAP and Syracuse also offer a series of video workshops, presented by Orrick, designed to provide legal guidance to veteran entrepreneurs.
Locally, in collaboration with a number of prominent law firms, LEAP has launched a free hotline and in August is hosting a series of virtual workshops and legal clinics to support the county’s veteran entrepreneurs in their time of need.
I’m a Veteran Entrepreneur or Small Business Owner, and I need guidance:
Do you have a general legal question? Are you seeking general guidance?
Click here to fill out our intake form and access our LEAP Hotline.
Do you want to participate in a LIVE, VIRTUAL Workshop and Clinic?
Join us every Thursday evening in August for a free legal
clinic- learn your options and receive a free consultation with a pro bono
attorney.
