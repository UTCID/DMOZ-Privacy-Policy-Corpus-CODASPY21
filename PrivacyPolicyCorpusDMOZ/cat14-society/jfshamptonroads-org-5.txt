Send A Card
There’s no better way to remember or recognize the ones you love and respect than by making an honorarium or memorial contribution. For weddings, anniversaries, bar and bat mitzvahs, birthdays or remembering those who have passed away, honorarium or memorial cards honor those close to you and help JFS continue to provide an array of services to the Hampton Roads community. Cards are typically mailed by JFS within 24 hours, and each donor will receive an acknowledgement of their gift.
