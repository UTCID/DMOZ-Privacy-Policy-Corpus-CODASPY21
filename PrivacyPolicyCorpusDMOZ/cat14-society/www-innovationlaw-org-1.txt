Mission Statement
The Centre for Innovation Law and Policy was created in 1999 to foster research on laws, institutions and policies that affect – or are affected by – innovation or technological change. It supports teaching, research and programming in a broad range of areas, including intellectual property, telecommunications, electronic commerce and the Internet, biotechnology and the financing of innovative ventures. In all of its activities, the Centre endeavors to serve as a focal point for collaborative activity involving members of the academic, professional, business and policy-making communities concerned with innovation law and policy.
