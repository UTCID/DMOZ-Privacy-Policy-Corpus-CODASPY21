EU - Vice-President Kroes hosts CEO Roundtable on investment in broadband networks to sustain internet growth
(Europa)
How best to ensure the very high levels of private sector investment necessary for the deployment of next generation broadband networks to sustain internet growth and so meet Europe's Digital Agenda targets. At a high-level meeting of CEOs and senior board-level company representatives in Brussels on March 3, European Commission Vice-President for the Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes asked industry to come forward with concrete proposals on how to address the broadband investment challenge. The meeting asked an interdisciplinary group led by Ben Verwaayen of Alcatel-Lucent, René Obermann of Deutsche Telekom and Jean-Bernard Lévy of Vivendi, to engage with all stakeholders to develop a holistic approach, with a view to confirming such proposals at a CEO Summit in Brussels on 13th July.

EU - Towards a European Cloud Computing Strategy
(RAPID)
Speech by Neelie Kroes Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda, World Economic Forum Davos, 27 January 2011.
I want to make Europe not just "cloud-friendly" but "cloud-active". I will invite cloud providers and cloud users to Brussels for a series of intense consultations in the spring. Broadband for all – every European digital – is the Digital Agenda's ICT infrastructure policy. People often ask me what will be done with all that bandwidth. I am convinced that cloud computing is an important part of the answer. If you agree and want to help us to get it right, I am the woman to talk to.

EU's Kroes: 30 percent of Europeans are 'digital virgins'
(CNET)
Privacy concerns need to be further addressed if Europe is to lure the 30 percent of its population that remain "digital virgins" onto the Internet. "There are still digital virgins as I am always saying," European Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, speaking at the Techonomy conference here. One of the big hurdles, she said, is trust. And while the elderly are the least likely to be online, she said that it is not strictly an age issue. Kroes was blunt when asked if there were any downsides to Europe's comparatively stricter policies regarding privacy. "No, not at all," she said. However, she didn't suggest that her track record was perfect. "I've learned more from my mistakes than my successes...and my list of mistakes is much longer," she said.
Kroes also said that hurdles remain to entrepreneurship in Europe, including a lack of venture capital, among other issues. "Our labor laws are rather strict," Kroes said. "But we are on the move, so to say."

CN - China's plan to use internet for propaganda
(Sydney Morning Herald)
The Chinese Communist Party has detailed its ambitious but secretive strategy for transforming the internet into a force for keeping it in power and projecting "soft power" abroad. An internal speech by China's top internet official, apparently posted by accident on an official internet site before being promptly removed, outlines a vast array of institutions and methods to control opinion at home and also "create an international public opinion environment that is objective, beneficial and friendly to us". Concerning the Development and Administration of Our Country's Internet, Report by Wang Chen,
Deputy Director, Propaganda Department, Communist Party of China (CPC) Director, External Propaganda Department, CPC Director, Information Office, State Council, People's Republic of China. Delivered on April 29, 2010 before the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

EU - Digital Agenda: Commission outlines action plan
(Europa)
Implementing the ambitious Digital Agenda for Europe unveiled
by the European Commission would contribute significantly to the EU's economic growth and spread the benefits of the digital era to all sections of society. The Agenda outlines seven priority areas for action: creating a digital Single Market, greater interoperability, boosting internet trust and security, much faster internet access, more investment in research and development, enhancing digital literacy skills and inclusion, and applying information and communications technologies to address challenges facing society like climate change and the ageing population. Examples of benefits include easier electronic payments and invoicing, rapid deployment of telemedicine and energy efficient lighting. In these seven areas, the Digital Agenda foresees some 100 follow-up actions, of which 31 would be legislative.

US - FCC chairman proposes increased regulation of Internet service providers
(Washington Post)
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski has proposed putting Internet service providers (ISPs) into the same category as telephone companies, a move aimed at solidifying the agency's authority over the fast-growing broadband industry. The proposal would impose a fresh layer of rules on a sector that has so far been lightly regulated. By reclassifying broadband providers, the FCC hopes to be able to carry out its plans to greatly expand Internet access nationwide and require companies that get consumers onto the Web to treat all online traffic equally. Genachowski portrayed his plan as a middle-of-the-road approach to regulating broadband, saying he would exempt providers from dozens of rules that typically apply to phone companies.
