What information do we collect?If you are making an enquiry via a web form, we may store your name and contact details (email address and/or telephone number). We also collect other information automatically, as described below.
Automatically collected informationWe automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us on our sites and in internal e-mail correspondence. Automatic technologies we use may include, for example, Web server logs/IP addresses, cookies and Web beacons.
Web Server Logs/IP Addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allows computers and servers to recognise and communicate with each other. ECM International collects IP addresses via Google Analytics in order to conduct site analysis and Web site performance review.

Web beacons, cookies and other tracking technologies do not automatically obtain personally identifiable information about you.
