Gifts of All Kinds Make a DifferenceLSS Is Where Life Stories Take ShapeNon-monetary gifts are needed by many LSS services. Gifts of clothing, hygiene products, games and so much more make a significant impact of the lives of people we serve. Gifts of supplies and services also help reduce the expense of our services and enhance the quality of programming we can provide.
For specific items needed for each region, please see below. If you have an idea or items to give and would like to visit with us, please contact an LSS Development officer below.
