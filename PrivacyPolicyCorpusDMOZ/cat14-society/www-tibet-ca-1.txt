Our Mission
The Canada Tibet Committee defends and promotes human rights and democratic freedoms of the Tibetan people.

The Canada Tibet Committee achieves its goals by:
Engaging current foreign policy debates in Canada;
Meeting with parliamentarians and government officials;
Organizing policy seminars and cultural events;
Conducting research and publishing reports;
Collaborating with like-minded organizations across Canada.
Our Vision
The Canada Tibet Committee aspires to a world in which Tibet is a Zone of Peace - a neutral, demilitarized sanctuary where weapons are forbidden and where all people fully enjoy their human rights and live in harmony with nature.
Our Values
Non-violence, tolerance, and compassion as our strategy;
Volunteerism; openness; and integrity as our method;
Respect for the Tibetan people’s democratic process as our guiding principle.
Strategic Plan 2016-2019
The CTC's three year strategic plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on September 27, 2015.
The plan is the outcome of a lengthy consultative and study process including meetings with parliamentarians and community representatives. Plan objectives prioritize Government of Canada intervention in support of Tibet, organizational sustainability, and Tibetan leadership.

The Canada Tibet Committee will strive to minimize pollution and waste, buy environmentally friendly products, and encourage environmentally preferable transportation.

Gender Policy
The Canada Tibet Committee participated in the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 and actively contributed to its outcome document. Our organization views women’s rights as a priority of human rights law as articulated in the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Canada Tibet Committee will advance gender equality practices within its organizational structure through careful attention to the appointment of Directors and management of human resources.
The Canada Tibet Committee will create and pursue a gender sensitive work environment.
In the exercise of its external activities, the Canada Tibet Committee will strive to apply gender analysis within its research and reporting activities, and take into account the differing impacts that human rights violations and a democratic deficit have on women and men.
Our Directors, volunteers and employees will receive a copy of this policy and will be involved in supporting its goals.
