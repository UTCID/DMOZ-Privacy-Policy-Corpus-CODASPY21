Privacy Policy
LFCS values its visitors’ privacy. This privacy policy summarizes what information we might collect from a registered user or other visitor, and what we will and will not do with it.
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for lfcsmo.org. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. If you visit a web site that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It will notify you of the following:

What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
How policy changes are communicated.
Information Collection, Use and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email list registration, email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request/donation.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to inform you of other opportunities, events, or changes to this privacy policy.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for ‘https’ at the beginning of the address of the web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
