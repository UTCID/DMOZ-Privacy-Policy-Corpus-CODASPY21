This page describes the rights I have as the author of the material and intellectual property contained in Asian-Nation and your rights as a visitor.
Copyright and Fair Use
The information, material, and text for which I am the author in this site is essentially licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States license.
What this basically means is that as described within current copyright laws and the Digital Millenium Act of 1996, as the author, I retain the copyright to all the text in Asian-Nation (except where otherwise noted).
This means that you, as the visitor, cannot copy any part of the text and use it for commercial purposes (such as publishing it somewhere else and making a profit on it) without receiving my explicit written permission (you can email me at my Contact page).
However, under fair use laws, you are free to use and even copy the text in Asian-Nation for educational purposes (such as doing research for a term paper or report, etc.).
In fact, this is one of the reasons why I created Asian-Nation in the first place -- to help you learn more about the Asian American community.
So I encourage you to use any and all of the information that you find interesting and helpful for your research purposes.
You can also reprint the articles contained in Asian-Nation on your own website, provided that you obey the following conditions: (1) you are limited to a total of five reprinted articles per domain name; (2) your website does not include any material that is pornographic, obscene, blatantly offensive, hateful, or encourages any illegal activity; and (3) you explicitly cite me as the author according to the example below.
If you decide to copy any of the text in Asian-Nation for a report, research paper, etc. or reprint any article(s) on your own website, I ask that you respect
copyright laws and the principles of academic honesty and cite me as the author.
Citing your sources might take some practice, but it is the right thing to do and I would be most appreciative.
You can format your citation as follows (at the end of each article, there is a "Suggested reference" example as well):
Author's name (Le, C.N.)
Year that the site was last updated ()
Title of the page in quotes (i.e, "Asian Gangs" or "Anti-Asian Racism")
Title of the web site in italics (Asian-Nation)
URL of the page in brackets (<http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml>)
Date that you accessed/first read the page in parentheses (i.e., )
One example would be:
Le, C.N. . "The Model Minority Image." Asian-Nation.

However, if you choose to provide any of that information, I guarantee that I do not compile them into any kind of list, record, or database nor will I share, rent, or sell it with any person, organization, or company -- ever.
I only ask because now that you know a little something about me, I'm just curious about you, my visitor -- that's all.
With that, I wish you an interesting and useful exploration of Asian-Nation.
