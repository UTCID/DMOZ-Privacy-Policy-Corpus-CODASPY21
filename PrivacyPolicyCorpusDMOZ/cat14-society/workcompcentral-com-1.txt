Education Subscription Annual Pass (ESAP)
A WorkCompCentral ESAP entitles you to attend as many live educational seminars and on-line
education courses as you wish during the active term of the subscription. There are some
exceptions, described below.
WorkCompCentral ESAP programs are on an annual basis only and cannot be designated for
any shorter term; a subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled before renewal date
by you. The failure of a credit card charge on renewal terminates your subscription until you
renew. The ESAP is non-transferrable.
Attendance of any course, live or on-line, is conditional upon a current and active subscription.
For example, if you enroll in a live course and your subscription ends prior to the start of the
course you will not be allowed to attend until your subscription is renewed. Likewise, if you
begin an online course during an active subscription, but your subscription ends prior to
completion of the course, you will not be able to finish that course until your subscription is
renewed.
Students attending Live Seminars via use of the Education Subscription Annual Pass (ESAP) may cancel seven (7) or more days prior to the Live Seminar, without being charged a refund administration fee. Cancellations that occur less than seven (7) days prior to the Live Seminar or Live Webinar date will incur a charge for the event at the special member price. The current member price for standard 6 hour Live Seminars is $299.
There are NO REFUNDS. Repeat: THERE ARE NO REFUNDS FOR EDUCATION SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Credential and certification programs are excluded. Courses taken under an ESAP may count
towards a credential or certification, but only after you pay the full cost of the credential or
certification, as applicable at the time of request. In such a case, there is no credit for the cost of
the ESAP; i.e. you must pay the entire cost of the credential or certification regardless of
whether you have taken any or all of the required courses using an ESAP, though such courses
will count towards credential or certification curriculum requirements (you may still be required to
take exams or quizzes).
The Annual Comp Laude® Gala is is included with the ESAP and is non-transferable.
WorkCompCentral reserves the right to omit any course from ESAP enrollment, and
WorkCompCentral reserves the right to change subscription options and/or pricing at any time.
Reasonable efforts will be made by WorkCompCentral to notify you of any changes made to the
ESAP program and/or its offerings.
All live courses are enrolled on a first come, first served basis. Your ESAP does not guarantee
enrollment or attendance at any live seminar or event. If you are interested in attending a live
seminar or event you should enroll immediately. There is no penalty for cancelling or failing to
attend.

WorkCompCentral will not provide a refund, for any reason, once an ad has been published. If a position has been filled, WorkCompCentral can deactivate or replace the ad with another the remaining time.

Corrections can be made at any time by logging into the posting account or by contacting support@workcompcentral.com. Results are not guaranteed for ads placed on www.workcompjobs.com.
