Since 1911, Southwestern Law School has served the public as a nonprofit, nonsectarian educational institution. Southwestern does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, veteran/military status, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law in connection with admission to the school, or in the administration of any of its educational, employment, housing, financial aid, scholarship, or student activity programs. Nondiscrimination has been the policy of Southwestern since its founding. Southwestern's policy on nondiscrimination is to comply fully with applicable state and federal law.
The law school also requires employers using its placement services and facilities to abide by these standards and to ensure that no such discrimination occurs in hiring, promotion, or compensation for work assignments.
It is the policy and practice of Southwestern Law School to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and state and local requirements regarding students and applicants with disabilities. No qualified individual with a disability shall be denied access to or participation in services, programs and activities of Southwestern Law School. Copies of the complete policy regarding students and applicants with disabilities may be obtained from the Admissions Office.
Southwestern is a qualified exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Gifts to the law school are deductible from state and federal taxes.
Southwestern's Catalog, Application Guide and Student Handbook have been designed to answer frequently asked questions concerning the admission process; the academic, financial aid, and placement programs; and the general policies and regulations of Southwestern Law School. These publications have been prepared with the best data available as of their copyright date regarding these matters, as well as course offerings, tuition, fees, faculty and administration.
Information about grading, scholastic requirements, incompletes, attendance requirements, the honor code and all rules, regulations and procedures of the law school is published in the annual Student Handbook. Students should make sure they receive a copy of the Handbook when they commence their studies at Southwestern and familiarize themselves with its contents.
