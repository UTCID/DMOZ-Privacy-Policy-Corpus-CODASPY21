Danielle Bird was very professional and worked hard to make sure I was compensated fairly for my injury. My case was difficult to prove, but she continued to move forward and supported me through the process. I would highly recommend her for Workers' Compensation claims.

I was involved in a car accident that was complicated at best. God blessed with me Eric Beyer as my attorney. Although it was a long drawn out process between the two insurance companies, Eric was not only my attorney, he was my rock.
Eric is one of the most ethical people I have ever met in my lifetime. He was a constant source of not only information, but of comfort throughout the whole process. I never doubted for one moment that Eric did not have my best interest at heart. He took every word I said seriously and did what he had to do. If I ever have the misfortune of another injury like this, I would go to no one other than Eric Beyer. I will never in my lifetime be able to thank Eric enough or let him know how much I respect him and what a comfort he was and has continued to be for me. God Bless you Eric Beyer.

Eric W. Beyer helped me through a very difficult time and his professionalism, advice and results from an injury were highly respected. Amidst the personal part of getting myself back to health, his guidance when life was blurry was so appreciated. He listened and then put forth my options honestly and directly which I totally appreciated!
Was totally satisfied with his hard work and dedication to help me. I'd highly recommend him. Thank you Eric!

In need of a personal injury attorney? Well you're if you're reading this you're in the right place. You'd be hard pressed to find more competent attorneys than the ones here at SiebenCarey.
They took my case to trial and an amazing job presenting the facts and fighting for my best interests! Three years ago I was unsure of what my future would bring; now that it's over I can rest a bit easier. With SiebenCarey as my counsel, I believe I had the absolute BEST representation a person could've asked for. I knew that I wanted the absolute best representation when searching for an attorney to handle my case and I most definitely received it.
If you need a personal injury attorney, look no further. Can't recommend highly enough.

I was seriously injured in a car accident on my wedding night and went to SiebenCarey. Being involved in an accident is never fun. The folks at SiebenCarey got us thru the event helping us get on with our lives. They were up front and honest. We knew we could trust them. It’s clear to me why Art has been recognized as a Best Lawyer in America and Super Lawyer for 12 years running.

I'm glad Jim and his staff were on my side after my accident in 2017. Everybody was so helpful and answered all of my questions. I had more than just the accident taking a toll on me at the time! I was still in the midst of having Chemo Therapy. Everyone was so kind to me and Jim was so helpful along with Rachel, Jayne, Lori, and Angela.
I also appreciated the fact that Jim called personally to let me know what was going on. Thanks to everyone and I would recommend Jim to anyone in need.

Jeff Sieben was the first one I talked to about my injury. I was not sure if there was even a case. But as the months went by and my pain got worse, the seriousness of the injury became apparent. Jeff took on the case and put me at ease about the medical bills and calls. He was professional in his attitude while being compassionate to my situation. I have recommended him to others and will continue to do so.

Art and his staff helped me after I was involved in a bad car crash. I can't believe what an unbelievable job they did. First, they were always available when I needed them. I could call any time and they honestly kept me from getting anxiety attacks. When they told me the details of my settlement, I thought they were kidding. It was so beyond what I imagined possible. Based on my experience I would recommend Art and the SiebenCarey firm to anyone who has the misfortune of getting in an accident. They are the best!

Injuries are difficult in many ways. Physically speaking, they are burdensome and debilitating. On the mental/emotional level, they are traumatizing and labor intensive. Before having my case transferred to SiebenCarey and the legal team of Matthew Steinbrink, I was ready to give up. From our very first point of contact, I knew I was in good hands. Matt and the team were extremely empathetic and receptive to my concerns, and I was constantly reassured that I would be at the forefront of all decisions being made. This level of respect and transparency would remain a constant for the rest of my case. I am forever indebted to Matt and his extraordinary team of professionals. Thank you for fighting this fight with me.

Eric Beyer made what felt like a difficult process, very simple. If I didn’t have Eric’s help, I don’t know how I could’ve gotten the wage loss benefits due to me from my insurance company, because it was so slow in coming to me. Lots of runaround.
The security of having an attorney in your corner is powerful! Especially when the person  at fault for hitting me, that insurance company was calling me daily to check on me and “how are you doing?”  Their trick is to get you to say that you’re fine, but you don’t know how you are doing until at least a week after the crash. It takes time for the adrenaline to calm down before you realize how deeply hurt you really are. And by the time you could’ve told the insurance company multiple times that “I’m  fine” and the truth is - you’re not.
My advice is to get Eric immediately after an injury, and not to talk to the opposing insurance company (if it’s a car crash), and to document everything. Eric doesn’t charge you any money up front! But if you don’t get an attorney, it can cost you plenty in the end. Insurance companies are skilled at not paying, don’t be one of their victims.

In my experience with Art, I'd 10/10 highly recommend SiebenCarey to anyone questioning who to go to for answers!

If it were all about the settlement, I would give Bob Brabbit 5 stars. He and his staff were so much more though. There was the patience to take us through this two year long ordeal. Answering our questions and explaining to us what was going on. There was the knowledge Bob had to take on a big insurance company. And last there was the determination to get us the best possible deal. Bob was referred to me by a friend in the legal business and I would be proud to recommend him and his staff to anyone with workman's compensation problems. Great job Bob!!!!!

I was out for the day on my birthday,  it was a beautiful sunny day . I fell in the parking lot and sustained several injures. I contacted SiebenCarey, I was surprised that they would come to my house for a consultation. Paul Downs was my attorney, and I could not have been more pleased because he made me feel more relaxed and at ease about my accident. I have never had a situation like this in my life, and Paul worked very hard to obtain a settlement. I would highly recommend SiebenCarey and their associates, they kept me informed, whether by phone, mail . If i ever had a question they were there for me. Thanks Paul

People do not realize how important it is to team up with a professional that has experience and skill in handling the complex world of claims and insurance. The laws change all the time and when you team up with an attorney with the experience and background that specialize in personal injury, you get someone that knows the changes in the law so that you can be at ease throughout the process.
I am so pleased that Art and his staff were able to wade through this very complex case and bring it to the best resolution possible. I now have the financial ability to try and put my life back together and get back to as near a normal life as I possibly can. Without Art, this would not have been possible. I am forever grateful and strongly recommend that if you have had the misfortune to get hurt at the hands of another, please give Art a call in Lakeville, MN.

Our expectations for Mr Kosieradski were very high since we had two family attorneys, themselves successful litigators, tell us that he was their first choice. This was confirmed at our first meeting when we saw that he had the combination of integrity, skill and temperament we were looking for. Even so, the settlement he negotiated exceeded even our high expectations. We and our family are enthused and grateful for what he has accomplished.

In June of 2013 I was enjoying a ride on my vintage motorcycle, and was severely injured by an inattentive motorist, sending me to the hospital, physical therapy, and amassing a considerable amount of debt.
Fortunately I made contact with Robert Hauer, and Paul Downes with SiebenCarey!
Paul walked me through the entire process, explaining in layman's terms as to what to expect, and he continued to keep me informed as each step was reached.
Ultimately we used mediation to reach a settlement that allowed me to pay off my outstanding bills, and to bank an amount that gave me some peace of mind.
If by some unfortunate incident you ever have need for the services of a personal injury attorney, I highly recommend SiebenCarey... Thanks Paul!

I can not say enough positive things about SiebenCarey. I was blessed with a GREAT lawyer named Cory Whalen who went WAY out of his way several times to help me. I was in a fairly bad car accident where a driver ran a red light and T boned me. I have battled sever anxiety and depression and I can honestly say when I was at rock bottom and I basically sent an email to Cory asking if I died would my money go to my children and Cory sensed something wasn't right and gave me some options I wasn't aware of. I can honestly say Cory played a huge role in my life and because of him and other great people I am alive and doing well today! Thank you! I can not say that enough to this firm and definitely ask for CORY WHALEN he WILL get you taken care of and will get you what you deserve! Thank you Cory! Sincerely, Scott C.

He was very knowledgeable and we trusted him to represent us well, which he did. We are happy to be completed with our settlement process but would recommend the company and Paul to anyone that would be seeking legal assistance!

I  was involved in a serious car accident and reached out to Art for guidance.  I had heard as well as read online reviews about Art.  All of which were very positive about his ability and determination to look out for his clients best interest, and that he does.  I suffered horrible neck pain, traumatic brain injury, hand injury, etc.  I ended up needing to undergo neck surgery due to this accident.  Art as well as Bev his assistant guided me through the entire process.  All they wanted of me was to keep up with my much needed therapies and rehabilitation, and to just concentrate on taking care of myself.  They completely took care of the rest and I'm pleased with the outcome.  Art and Bev were always very prompt about answering my questions and routinely got back to me right away.  No one ever wants to be in a car accident let alone suffer injuries but if you are I would completely advise and recommend you placing your complete trust in Art and his team at SiebenCarey Personal Injury Lakeville location.

I tell all my friends and anyone who needs a great attorney about Bob Brabbit! He is the BEST in our minds! We have great proof of that!
Thanks Bob for all your hard work and amazing professionalism and getting the job well done!

You made sure I got all the help I needed! Mark Olive made sure that I got the best compensation possible through mediation. In the long run your office made me feel like you were looking out for my best interest all the way around, and yes I have recommended your group to people that have asked who helped me!

My family was referred to Susan Holden at SiebenCarey by our hometown attorney in a wrongful death case.  She was very accommodating to us and very approachable. Staff was top notch and doggedly pursued two different insurance companies to accomplish an outcome far beyond anything we'd anticipated. We could not have gotten results close to what she achieved without her. We will be forever appreciative.

As a disability lawyer, I have opportunities to work with and recommend Personal Injury Firms, and SiebenCarey (and Art in particular) is one of the firms and lawyers I have at the top of my referral list. My ex-wife was injured in an auto accident, and I sent her to Art, who did his usual excellent and professional job in helping her recover what she was owed. I've also had occasion to work on a large, complex case with Art that spilled over into my specialty. We produced an outstanding result for our client. I was particularly impressed by the fact that he and his firm never hesitated to bring in and pay for outside expert resources that maximized our chances to win the case. Not every firm has the mindset or wherewithal to do that.

Last year my daughter was killed in a car accident. She was a single mother taking care of two young children. I hired Art at the SiebenCarey Lakeville office. It was the best thing I ever did. Art has helped me through what has been the most difficult time in my life. Art and his staff have treated me more like a friend than a client. I would strongly encourage you to call Art at SiebenCarey Lakeville if you are ever so unfortunate as to need an attorney.

I've worked with Art Kosieradzki as co-counsel in a number of major personal injury and coverage cases, and I know his abilities. He is a top-flight trial lawyer and he has the results to prove it. At least two of his attributes may not be immediately apparent, however: First, he's creative and has achieved large recoveries where a lesser lawyer might have given up. Second, he cares and he has time for people. The latter is a precious quality in our hard-driven profession. Add to that an excellent and personable staff and the backing of the powerhouse SiebenCarey law firm, and what you have in Art is simply this: the right lawyer.

We were VERY pleased with Jeff's attention to us and our case.  Jeff, and all of the team there, did an outstanding job of making that process as stress-free as possible for us.  The communications were never delayed; response time (no matter how often we had questions) was beyond expectations. We truly liked Jeff's up-front and true-life demeanor, nothing was sugar-coated nor was anything spoken or written in terms we didn't understand which meant we were all talking on the same levels and never felt uneducated in the attorney world we were dealing with. I would certainly refer anyone I know to you all!

Jim Carey and his staff were great. Returned calls promptly and answered any and all questions in layman's terms for me. Exceeded my expectations. I've already told family and friends that if any of them should need personal injury representation to contact SiebenCarey. I wouldn't hesitate to contact them again if necessary.

I had the unfortunate experience of being bitten and torn by a Pit Bulldog. I turned to Art Kozieradski and his staff at the Lakeville office of SiebenCarey law firm. I couldn't have made a better choice. Art listened carefully to what I wanted to have happen, collected all of the documents and information required and presented my case to the attorneys of the dog owner's insurance company. He and his staff worked on the case for several months and kept me informed as to what was happening every step of the way. His negotiating skills led to a VERY good settlement. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome.

Art and his Lakeville team have been a tremendous legal resource for our patients injured in motor vehicle accidents. Getting into an accident is terribly inconvenient; it can be very scary and overwhelming.. insurance companies, vehicle damage, loss wages, replacement services, medical bills and the list goes on .. sometimes the situation warrants a strong legal counsel to help navigate through that process.. Art can give you the peace of mind you need and deserve. They will work hard to make sure all bases are covered, all needs are met and will go the extra mile to make sure you are are treated fairly at the end of the day! Highly recommend.

I have been working with Art and his staff since 2013 when I was run over by a drunk driver. Everyone from Beverly who runs his front office and stays in constant contact with me just as much as he does to Lynn, another lawyer in the office who does just as much research on every case as Art does and fights along side to get the fairest settlements possible for the victims. The one thing that struck me from the beginning was that Art's firm was the only firm who sent his investigator to me. His investigator was amazing; kind, thorough and compassionate. Every time I wanted to give in and just "be done" with it all because I was just so tired of fighting, Art and his amazing team kept going; knowing and feeling the same frustration I was feeling. They are both professional and empathetic to their clients and made me feel as if I was the only client they had.;even though I knew they are very busy. I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of a personal injury law firm.

On November 17, 2017 I was involved in a car accident with a friend. A young man ran a red light. Both of us were ambulanced to the nearest hospital. With in three hours I had a friend call Jim Carey's office because they had used them . I had someone by my bedside the very next morning, and Jim Carey and his staff took such good care of me. They really did take the worry off my shoulders. Bottom line, it took about a year and a half and they were with me the entire time... Jim and his staff Angela, Jayne, and Lori, were all amazing. Got back to me fast, answered my questions so I could understand, and Jim would call if I needed to ask him a question. I felt I was the most important client!! If you need someone who will show that they care, you will not go wrong with Jim Carey and his staff.

I've worked with Art on more than one occasion. One time for premise case and a second time for a car accident. The results were outstanding. Art and his staff are very friendly and made the whole process extremely easy. If you are ever injured I highly recommend you give Art a call at the Lakeville SiebenCarey office. You won't be disappointed.

I have known Mark Olive for many years!  Mark has navigated me through several work related injuries in the world of Workman's Comp(WC) issues since 1987.
Mark and his team (especially Sharon Hanson) are so amazing...knowledgeable, innovative, persistent, honest, hard-working, informative, great communication skills, organized, kind, caring, accessible, trust-worthy, sensitive to employee's concerns, great listeners, advocates, able to lead workers who are struggling to make sense of a VERY complicated system (WC), and so extremely professional in every way!!  Mark is able to explain even the most mind-boggling legal jargon, information, details, and the 'plan' to an employee in a way that is simply honest and sensible.
Mark and his team truly work to improve the lives of workers who have been injured on-the-job with integrity, thoroughness, legal thoughtfulness, and perseverance.
I will continue to recommend Mark and his team to educational professionals who have been injured on-the-job as well as to friends in other professions.  Lastly, I have been fortunate to experience who I believe is the best Attorney in the Twin Cities area!!
Thank you for everything Mark & team!  Chris Zweber

My wife and I were involved in a car accident on October 4, 2018 when a driver approaching us decided to make a U turn and hit us. My wife spent nine days in the ICU with 10 broken or fractured ribs and multiple other injuries, and I had a broked rib and lacerations from my seat belt. The car was totaled.
We contacted SiebenCarey on the advice of a lawyer friend who we asked, “Who is the best injury lawyer in the Twin Cities”? We were interviewed within hours and the wheels were put in motion for medical benefits and recovery of our property and damages. We were advised that a complete settlement could take over a year, but our bills were paid and a settlement reached in less than 8 months.
Jim Carey called us several times during this period of time to update us on the progress of our claims. We are very happy and satisfied with the way we were treated and the results of our claim.

I worked with Art following a life-changing accident I was in. Art and his team were great to work with, very professional yet personable. I felt like I was in good hands the entire time they were handling my case, and everything resolved to my satisfaction. Art never stopped fighting for me, and I felt like he cared about making sure I was taken care of for my own sake, and that I was happy with however the case resolved. I hope to never have to recommend him to anyone, but if I know someone who ends up in a situation like mine, I know who to tell them to talk to.

I came to SiebenCarey and worked with Art following a fall. I was very impressed with how caring and concerned Art and his staff were regarding my situation. Because of the fall I sustained serious facial fractures and they helped me through it both legally and emotionally. They also kept me informed and in the loop as the case progressed. Having never been through this before, that was extremely important to me. In the end we were able to make a recovery that exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend everyone to consider Art if you ever get injured.
