Elliott Moffett, a member of the Nez Perce tribe, holds a sign that reads Free the Snake as he takes part in a February rally in Olympia, Washington, that was organized by a coalition of environmental and tribal groups to promote the breaching of dams on the Snake River. The Trump administration has rejected dam removal during the COVID-19 pandemic.
