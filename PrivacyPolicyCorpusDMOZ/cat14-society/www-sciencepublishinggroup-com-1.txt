E-mail Policy
It is the policy of Science Publishing Group to send our members email throughout the publishing process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, Science Publishing Group will send newsletters and other communications to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.
Ad Servers
Although Science Publishing Group do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies, we do use an ad server via our web hoster to keep track of data, like number of impressions.
Our Commitment to Data Security
We endeavor to keep your personal information confidential and protected against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration through the use of industry-standard encryption technologies. Your personal information is stored on servers that are behind a firewall and physically located within a secured data centre. However, no information transferred over the Internet is completely secure and, therefore, Science Publishing Group cannot guarantee with 100% certainty the total security of information transmitted to it.
