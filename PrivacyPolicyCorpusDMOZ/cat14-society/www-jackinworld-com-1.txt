Question of the Week
Do you find yourself masturbating more often during some seasons than others? Why?Answer this question | Suggest a question
privacy
Fat cowboy public gymnastics
Gender:
Male
I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian home, and was raised to think that the act of masturbation was both disgusting and evil. It wasn't until I was 17 that I discovered the contrary, and that my masturbation life began. Like all boys I had a tendency to get random erections, and always found them annoying and sometimes even painful. Being uncircumcised, I also found what few experiments I held in touching myself to be painful as well, as my glans was too sensitive for much direct contact.

The Eel
Gender:
Male
My first memory related to my genitals dates to an incident that occurred when I was about 4. Three other boys of the same age and I decided to compare the sizes of our penises. Incredibly, we did so in broad daylight in the parking area of our apartment building! I don't know if we were observed by anyone, but nothing was ever said — to me, at any rate. There were no further such episodes or anything else related to it.

Mountain excursion
Gender:
Male
It's Thursday morning and I'm awakened by that slightly nagging feeling one gets when the call of nature beckons. Only 4 o'clock, and as late as I retired the night before, I had been hoping for a little more sleep. I try to return to this strangely comical dream I was having, but no luck. Call of nature gets more insistent, so I hop out of bed and head for the bathroom. Back in bed again I'm ready for another 40 winks. Except for whatever trigger sets off in my brain that "dicky boy" was getting ready for some action! I know from long experience this was a call I couldn't just ignore.

Plateau of ecstacy
Gender:
Male
It has been a real pleasure for me to read many of the stories on JackinWorld where guys like me have recalled the joys of masturbation from pre-puberty to the present. My story is and has been filled with satisfying memories of masturbation.

Pleasant porcelain
Gender:
Male
Like many who've taken the time to join this amazing and awe-inspiring site, I have been a life-long masturbator. In fact, I cannot remember a time I haven't masturbated. Call it luck-of-the-draw, coincidence, or the best discovery of my life, but I found out how to pleasure myself before I can even remember my memories. For some reason I knew that it was best done in private, so I can't recall ever being scolded or diverted by my parents. I also don't remember them ever discussing it with me, which is just as well I suppose.

Motor oil
Gender:
Male
I don't remember when I didn't fondle my penis. I still do, every chance I get. My first memory is of sitting in my highchair at the dining-room table with no pants on, fondling my penis. Apparently, I had wet all my pants and they were in the washer. My father was yelling at me to "Stop that." I had no idea what he was talking about, so I kept right on fondling myself. He then said that if I didn't stop, he would throw his water at me. I didn't stop, since I didn't know what he was talking about, so he threw his water at me.

Wallow in the joy
Gender:
Male
I am a 67-year-old circumcised man who has been very happily married for 44 years and yet still indulges in the pleasurable pastime of masturbation. I suppose I must have been about 10 years old when I first discovered that by playing with my penis it would stiffen and produce a delightful sensation. My elder brother had already reached puberty, and he showed me the "fist" method so that I could induce the wonderful feeling that I later learned to be an orgasm.

Prof. So-and-so
Gender:
Male
I'm 47 years old, and I can't remember when I didn't know what an erection was. When I had one, it was lots of fun to play with. I remember being a little boy in the bathtub with a little tiny erection, rubbing it between my fingers, and it felt so good. My parents didn't give me much grief about it; they just studiously ignored the matter. I got the subliminal message that I should do it in private, or maybe not do it at all.

Bean-bag chair
Gender:
Male
I'm 35 now. I started masturbating before I'd heard about what it was, probably when I was 11. I'm not sure, maybe it was 10 — but I do remember that I was in bed in the morning before getting up for school, lying on my back and pushing my erection down between my thighs and letting it spring back up. I found that this felt really good, and I'd just lie there for several minutes, doing it over and over until the feeling got too intense and I'd stop.
