an online service or when you provide information in connection with an

When you order, we
ask you for your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses,

When you enter a
contest or other promotional event, we may ask for your name, address,
telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and
notify winners.
If you choose to
give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business
partners may need - to correspond with you, process a credit card order,
or deliver a product for example, it is our intent to let you know how
we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to
have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we
will respect your wishes.
SexualAstrology.com,
the service providers for it, and all vendors providing products or
services through our web site use your personal information: to operate
our web site and/or effect your transactions; to create and share
reports about your transactions among themselves; and to perform credit
fraud screening services for transactions between you and us and/or
others.
We intend to
continue improving the content and function of SexualAstrology.com. For
this reason, we monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help
us improve the design and layout of our site and provide content of
interest to you.

The privacy of our visitors to SexualAstrology.com is important to us.
At SexualAstrology.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of
personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit SexualAstrology.com, and how we safeguard your information. We
never sell your personal information to third parties.
Log Files
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your
IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit
our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
We also use third party advertisements on SexualAstrology.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such
as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the
Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to
someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone
who frequents cooking sites).
DoubleClick DART cookies
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are
browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is
used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your
previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel
advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable
information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone
number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites
using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as
well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or
accounts.
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow
cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
