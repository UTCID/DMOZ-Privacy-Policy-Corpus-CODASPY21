Last updated: March 2016
Acceptance of terms
AmericanProgress.org, including all website-related content and services (collectively, “AmericanProgress.org”) is provided by Center for American Progress (the “Center,” “we,” “us”). Your use of AmericanProgress.org is subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Terms of Use agreement (“Terms of Use”), which supplements any additional guidelines or other terms posted by the Center in relation to specific site-related services or content. Although you can access and read portions of AmericanProgress.org just by visiting the site, you must sign up to use certain AmericanProgress.org features—such as receiving newsletters. Use of other CAP-affiliated websites is governed by the terms of use policies posted on those sites.
Please note that we reserve the right to update or modify the Terms of Use without advance notice by posting a revised Terms of Use to this website. Visitors to AmericanProgress.org (“you”) can determine whether the Terms of Use has been modified since your last visit by checking the “Last updated” legend posted at the top of the Terms of Use. By using AmericanProgress.org, you agree to be bound by the version of the Terms of Use then in effect. If at any point you no longer agree to the Terms of Use, please discontinue your use of AmericanProgress.org. The Center may deny service to you at any time, including in the event you do not adhere to the Terms of Use.
About the Center and purpose of AmericanProgress.org
The Center for American Progress is an independent nonpartisan policy institute that is dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans, through bold, progressive ideas, as well as strong leadership and concerted action. Our aim is not just to change the conversation, but to change the country.
As a tax-exempt organization, the Center is prohibited from supporting attempts to influence the outcome of any election for public office. Accordingly, with AmericanProgress.org, the Center seeks to provide a forum to discuss policy—not to advance the interests of any particular political party or candidate for office.
