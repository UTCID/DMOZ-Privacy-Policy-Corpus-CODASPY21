Robinson+Cole Facilitates Launch of Statewide COVID-19 Small Business Virtual Legal Clinic in Wake of Coronavirus Pandemic
Firm to lead oversight of Connecticut-wide virtual clinic as part of national program
Robinson+Cole and the Connecticut Bar Association (CBA) will lead the Connecticut COVID-19 Small Business Virtual Legal Clinic as part of the nationwide program organized by Lawyers for Good Government to assist small businesses in weathering the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The mission of the clinic is to help Connecticut’s entrepreneurs and small businesses that have suffered adversely from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing free, limited-scope legal advice. Qualifying small businesses and nonprofits of 25 or fewer employees will be offered a free 45-minute phone or virtual consultation with pro bono attorneys who can answer legal questions and help determine the best path forward for those companies. Consultations will include helping Connecticut small business owners understand the legislative language in the CARES Act and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and answer questions related to employment, contracts, commercial leases and insolvency issues.
“Providing pro bono service to our communities has been a cornerstone of our firm’s 175-year history,” said Stephen E. Goldman, Managing Partner of Robinson+Cole. “We are pleased to work with the Connecticut Bar Association and other participating law firms and in-house legal departments to help small businesses navigate the unique challenges they face during this unprecedented time.”
In addition to Connecticut, Robinson+Cole lawyers in the New York City, Boston, Providence, Miami, Wilmington and Philadelphia offices of the firm will be working in conjunction with similar initiatives in those jurisdictions. The firm has a long and notable history of providing pro bono service, including years of leadership roles in legal services organizations. Robinson+Cole is ranked among the top 100 AmLaw 200 law firms for pro bono work.
“The CBA is pleased to collaborate with Connecticut law firms, corporations and volunteer attorneys to respond to the immediate and increasing legal needs of small businesses arising from the Coronavirus pandemic by sponsoring the COVID-19 Small Business Virtual Legal Clinic.” said Keith Soressi, Executive Director of the CBA.
