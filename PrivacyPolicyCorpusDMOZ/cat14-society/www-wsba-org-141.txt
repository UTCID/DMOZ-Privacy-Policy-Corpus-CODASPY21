Welcome to the Professionalism ToolkitResources will be added as they become available.Recognizing Lawyers and Judges For ProfessionalismThe WSBA's Professionalism in Practice (PiP) program is a way for lawyers, judges and the public to honor those in the legal profession who have conducted themselves in a highly professional manner consistent with the Creed of Professionalism.The Creed of ProfessionalismSee the full text of the Creed of Professionalism adopted by the Board of Governors on July 27, 2001.Robert's Fund — Fostering Civility in the Legal ProfessionIn an era too often marked by acts of incivility, Robert’s Fund aims to elevate the way we treat one another in the legal profession and to inspire acts of courtesy, kindness, and compassion among members of the profession. Increased civility demonstrably improves outcomes for legal professionals and the people that they serve. And because legal professionals profoundly influence society, even outside their formal work, their behavior often sets the tenor of corporate, political, and social interactions.
