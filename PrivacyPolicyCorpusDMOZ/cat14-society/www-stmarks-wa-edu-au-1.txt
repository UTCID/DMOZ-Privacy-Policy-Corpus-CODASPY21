School publications, like newsletters and magazines, which include personal information, may be used for marketing purposes.How does the School treat sensitive information?In referring to ‘sensitive information’, the School means: information relating to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation or practices or criminal record, that is also personal information; health information and biometric information about an individual.Sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose, unless you agree otherwise, or the use or disclosure of the sensitive information is allowed by law.Who might the School disclose personal information to?The School may disclose appropriate personal information, which may include sensitive information, held about an individual to:another school (for example, to facilitate student transfer between schools);government departments;medical practitioners;people providing services to the School, including specialist visiting teachers, counsellors and sports coaches;recipients of School publications, such as newsletters and magazines;parents;anyone you authorise the School to disclose information to; and anyone to whom we are required to disclose the information to by law.Sending information overseasThe School may disclose personal information about an individual to overseas recipients, for instance, when storing personal information with ‘cloud’ service providers which are situated outside Australia or to facilitate a school exchange. However, the School will not send personal information about an individual outside Australia without:obtaining the consent of the individual (in some cases this consent will be implied); orotherwise complying with the Australian Privacy Principles or other applicable privacy legislation.Use of student photographsPhotos and video footage of students are used regularly by the School for a number of purposes and guidelines for the use of student photographs are laid out in the Use of Student Photographs policy.Management and security of personal informationThe School’s staff are required to respect the confidentiality of students’ and parents’ personal information and the privacy of individuals.

Students will generally be able to access and update their personal information through their parents, but older students may seek access and correction themselves. There are some exceptions to these rights set out in the applicable legislation.To make a request to access or update any personal information the School holds about you or your child, please contact the Privacy Officer in writing. The School may require you to verify your identity and specify what information you require. The School may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying your application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material requested. If the information sought is extensive, the School will advise the likely cost in advance. If we cannot provide you with access to that information, we will provide you with written notice explaining the reasons for refusal.Consent and rights of access to the personal information of studentsThe School respects every parent’s right to make decisions concerning their child’s education. Generally, the School will refer any requests for consent and notices in relation to the personal information of a student to the student’s parents. The School will treat consent given by parents as consent given on behalf of the student, and notice to parents will act as notice given to the student.As mentioned above, parents may seek access to personal information held by the School about them or their child by contacting the Privacy Officer. However, there will be occasions when access is denied. Such occasions would include where release of the information would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others, or where the release may result in a breach of the School’s duty of care to the student.The School may, at its discretion, on the request of a student, grant that student access to information held by the School about them, or allow a student to give or withhold consent to the use of their personal information, independently of their parents. This would normally be done only when the maturity of the student and/or the student’s personal circumstances so warrant it.Inquiries and complaintsIf you would like further information about the way the School manages the personal information it holds, or wish to complain that you believe that the School has breached the Australian Privacy Principles please refer to the School’s Dispute and Complaint Resolution Policy, or contact the School’s Privacy Officer at  privacy@stmarks.wa.edu.au.
