Use of their services signifies Your agreement to those additional terms.
2. Benefits of Joining.
(a) GIsearch Services. As part of our dedication to our community, we currently provide users with access to a vast collection of information about current and former U.S. Military Personnel from all over the world. We also provide various communications tools which help You stay in touch with, contact, or renew friendships with military personnel. In addition, we may provide online forums, shopping services, personalized content and branded programming through GIsearch's web site or its services, collectively the "Services". GIsearch's Services are presently provided free of charge, although some of our service providers' services and some future GIsearch Services may be subject to a charge.
Service Limitations. We will try very hard to make Your experience with GIsearch a pleasurable one. However, we cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties. These difficulties may result in loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. You agree that GIsearch's Services are provided "AS-IS". GIsearch cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings.
Service Changes and Discontinuation. GIsearch reserves the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service at any time without notice. You agree that GIsearch will not be liable to You or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of the Service.
Privacy Policy. GIsearch respects Your privacy. The information You provide helps us make GIsearch more fun and useful for You. It also enables us to give You updates about our Service. We use technology and agreements to protect personally identifiable information that You provide (like Your name, age and email address). You should not receive any unauthorized email or postal mail from third parties as a result of giving information to GIsearch. Please keep in mind that whenever You voluntarily disclose personal information in GIsearch's public areas, that information can be collected and used by others. The complete terms of our Privacy Policy are part of this agreement so You should read it. http://www.GIsearch.com/info/privacy.php
Cancellation. You may cancel Your GIsearch membership at any time by clicking on the "Cancel Service" link found on Your Member Toolbox page. Please keep in mind that extended periods of inactivity may result in Your account being canceled. So, please remember to visit us regularly.
3. Mandatory Procedures and Guidelines.
For the benefit of the entire GIsearch community, and to comply with applicable laws, we have a few mandatory guidelines. We hope You will find them reasonable. Please understand, though, that any conduct that violates these procedures and guidelines is grounds for termination of Your account. For this reason, we ask that You carefully read and follow them.
Provide Accurate Information. You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about Yourself as requested in GIsearch's registration form and in the military personnel registration area. (We call this collective information "Registration Data".) Accurate records help us create a better site and provide us with opportunities to identify new services or products that may interest You. Please update the Registration Data to keep it current and accurate.
Guard Your Password. You will receive a password and username upon completing the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your password and username. And You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using Your password or username.

Use E-mail Wisely. GIsearch may provide its members with access to a free email account. In return for this free access, You agree not to use the Service to broadcast "junk mail", "spam", "chain letters", or unsolicited mass distribution of files or images.

Restrictions on Resale. GIsearch attempts to provide some of the very best content available on the web. In order to provide this content to You, however, we must restrict publication as well as redistribution of text, photos, graphics, audio and/or video materials in any form or medium.
