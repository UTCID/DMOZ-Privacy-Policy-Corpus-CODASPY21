ADVISORIES
Email Scams
Several deceptive emails claiming to be from or associated with the United Nations Foundation, Kathy Calvin, Rick Parnell, Ted Turner, and Timothy Wirth are circulating on the Internet. These emails often include our logo, photos, links, or other information from our Web site.
Some emails claim the recipient has won a lottery or other prize and request detailed personal information or a payment of some kind in order to receive the winnings. Some mention other foundations and organizations based in London and the United Kingdom none of which are a part of these scams. Other emails direct recipients to Web sites that promise large returns on investments and claim a portion of returns will be donated to the foundation.
The sources and contents of these emails, websites, and accompanying materials are in no way associated with the United Nations Foundation, Mr. Turner or Mr. Wirth. For your own protection, we strongly recommend not responding to emails making such claims.
The UN Foundation has reported, and will continue to report, these deceptive spam emails to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). For more information about the FTC’s efforts against deceptive spam, please visit http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/spam/report.html. For more information about the IC3, please visit http://www.ic3.gov/.Formore information about the FBI, please visit http://www.fbi.gov/or contact your local FBI office.
