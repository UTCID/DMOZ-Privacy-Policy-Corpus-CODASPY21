Privacy Policy
In the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by government agencies. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records provided by both state and federal laws. These exceptions include the need to protect the privacy of individuals.
Information collected at the Site becomes public record and may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exception in law exists. During your visit to the Site, information that does not personally identify you is automatically collected and stored. This information is used solely to improve our web services. Additional details on our privacy policy are listed below.

To better serve you, we occasionally use "cookies" to customize your browsing experience. Cookies are simple text files stored by your web browser when you first visit a website.

Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about an individual that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes personal identifiers such as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.
At the Site we collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the Site.
Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult and may be subject to public access.
Public Disclosure
In the State of California, the California Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250 et seq.) exists to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state or local government entities. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs: the privacy of individuals is included among these exceptions. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.
The Site strives to protect personally- identifiable information by collecting only information necessary to deliver our services. All information collected at the Site becomes public record and may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and Government Code Section 6250 et seq., or any other law governing the disclosure of records, Government Code Section 6250 or such other applicable law will control.
