HomeUncategorizedTwisted X committed to donating $1 million in footwear to the Hurricane Harvey victims. But the need was greater than the company realized, so they’ve recently committed to $2 million in boots and shoes. “The first thing people lose is their footwear,” says CEO Prasad Reddy. “Even first responders ruin their shoes and boots wading into water to help others – it’s a total loss. We really wanted to help our fellow Texans in this difficult time.” In partnership with Soles4Souls as the distributor, the effort has been a momentous one, displaying with aplomb organizations stepping up to help thousands still in need in the storm’s wake. The company’s third-party logistics partner, Coppell-based Daryl Flood Logistics, also stepped in to help with the donation. “This relief effort was of particular interest to us, as we are headquartered in Texas and had multiple warehouses affected by Hurricane Harvey,” said Jeff Talbot, Senior Vice President, at Daryl Flood Logistics. “We thought this was a great gesture on Twisted X’s part. We have drivers donating their services to transport the shoes, and packers donating time to pick and pack the shoes. The experience has been very humbling.” Thanks for watching!Visit WebsiteThanks for watching!Visit WebsiteThanks for watching!Visit WebsiteIn addition, Twisted X recently also donated directly to the Baytown, Texas Boot Barn that was heavily affected. “Our associates were directly impacted by the floods,” says Store Manager Eduardo Pedraza. “We had an associate who lost everything from clothing to all furniture in her home. We had several associates who had two feet of water in their homes and lost personal vehicles. Twisted X donated many pairs of the USA style moccasins to, not only our store associates, but many Baytown residents.”  Soles4Souls was founded as a disaster relief organization in 2006 and continues to act as "second wave" responders, working directly with manufacturers and retailers to procure brand new shoes, clothing and other necessities to distribute to those in need. Soles4Souls has set up a Harvey Relief Fund to mobilize product to affected areas and are accepting monetary donations or inviting people to raise funds.
