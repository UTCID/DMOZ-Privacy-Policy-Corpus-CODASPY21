AmazingVery nice meditation. It really helped establishing balance and feel the cool vibrations.Abhay Amlekar
Establishing balanceWhat is Yoga? It’s nothing more than taking your attention to your Spirit.Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
YogaWisdom doesn’t mean that you know how to argue things or you fight with people. No it does not mean that.Wisdom means how you take to the good side of everything to enjoy it. This is wisdom and that you avoid all destructive things and take to something constructive.Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
WisdomWonderful meditation, I wouldn’t mind doing a longer one, however I got right down to it and it felt very, very relaxing. Thank you!Adele Bentivegna
Wonderful meditationThank you for this website. I have been looking for this for a long time. Due to choices that I have made in my life I do not feel at peace or at one with myself, I use to but it has been a long time. I am ready to forgive myself and others. I look forward to healing myself and becoming my true self.Karen – USA
