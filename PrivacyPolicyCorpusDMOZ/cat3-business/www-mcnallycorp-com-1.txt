General
This Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) governs your use of the website owned by MCNALLY INTERNATIONAL, INC. (“McNally International”) accessible at www.mcnallycorp.com (the “Website”).  By using the Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time.
Privacy Policy
McNally International is committed to protecting the privacy of Website visitors and job applicants.  We believe it is important for you to understand the type of information we collect about you and how that information is used. We recognize the need for appropriate safeguards and management of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) you provide to us. This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles McNally International follows with respect to your PII.
Use of Your PII
Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will endeavor not to release your PII to unknown or unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference your PII with that of any other customer or entity.
You agree that McNally International may share your PII with its service providers, which may include job application services.  These service providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of your PII and are prohibited from using such information for any other purposes, including their own marketing purposes.
McNally International reserves the right to use or disclose information provided by you if required by law or if McNally International reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to (i) protect and defend McNally International’s rights or property; (ii) comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process; or (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the safety of McNally International users, employees or the public at large.
Unless otherwise described herein, McNally International does not share, sell, rent or trade information provided by you with any third party without your prior consent.
Security
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to allow only the appropriate use of your PII, we utilize physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your PII, McNally International utilizes a variety of physical and logical access controls, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network and database monitoring, anti-virus, and backup systems. We use encrypted sessions when collecting or transferring sensitive data through our websites.
We limit access to your PII and data to those persons who have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing such information.  McNally International employees who have been granted physical access to your PII are made aware of their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so.
It is important that you protect yourself from any unauthorized use of your password and unauthorized access to your computer. If you share your computer with others you should ensure that you log out after every session.  You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your password, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur using your password.  Please notify McNally International immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security.
