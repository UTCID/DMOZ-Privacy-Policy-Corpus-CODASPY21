A Study of the Costs of Legal Services in Personal Injury Litigation in Ontario by Allan C. Hutchinson
Contingency Fee Agreements (CFAs) are now a fixed feature of the Ontario litigation landscape.  However, little research or study has been done on exactly how they operate in practice, whether they advance the objectives that they were intended to achieve, and whether litigants are best served by the current arrangements.  In this study, Hutchinson intends to make a preliminary start to that research, set out some tentative criticisms of the CFA system as it currently operates, and, where appropriate, suggest preliminary proposals for change."Full Report: A Study of the Costs of Legal Services in Personal Injury Litigation in Ontario -
