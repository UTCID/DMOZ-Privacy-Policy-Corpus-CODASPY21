a. Mandatory Binding Arbitration. The parties to these terms and conditions agree that final and binding arbitration on an individual basis shall be the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of your purchase, our service, the Site or these terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute or claim relating to patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, shall not be resolved in arbitration and, instead, the parties agree that such dispute shall be resolved exclusively in an Ontario court or in the Federal Court of Canada, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.It is agreed that the resolution of any dispute by arbitration shall be using the ADR Chambers Expedited Arbitration Rules. It is agreed that the ADR Chambers Expedited Arbitration Rules give the parties a fair opportunity to present their case and respond to the case of the other side. The arbitration shall be held in Toronto, Ontario, shall be heard by a single retired judge of the Superior Court of Ontario and shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act (Ontario). Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The ADR Chambers Expedited Arbitration Rules are available at http://adrchambers.com/ca/.Any Notice of Arbitration should be mailed to us at the following address:Groupe SEB Canada Inc.2-36 Newmill Gate, Toronto, ON M1V 0E2Attention: The Presidentb. Class Action Waiver. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WITHOUT THE RIGHT FOR ANY DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.Disputes may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction without a jury and not in arbitration.c. Waiver of Rights. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. The rules in arbitration are different. There is no judge, and review of an arbitrator’s decision is very limited.13 Personal data:
