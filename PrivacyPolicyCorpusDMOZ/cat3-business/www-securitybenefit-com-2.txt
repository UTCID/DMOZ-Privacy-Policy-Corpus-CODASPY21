If you choose, or are provided with, a user name, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity.

All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter.  By continuing to use the Website following the posting of revised Terms of Use, you accept and agree to the changes.
No Offers
The information contained on this Website shall not be deemed to be an offer, or the solicitation of an offer of insurance products or securities.

For more complete information on any annuity products discussed herein, including expenses and any applicable charges and fees, please order a free prospectus. Read each prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. For more complete information on annuities discussed herein, please see the applicable Rate Sheet.
If you are purchasing an annuity as an investment vehicle for a retirement plan that receives preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, you should consider that an annuity does not provide any additional tax advantages to those already available through your retirement plan.  However, an annuity does offer features and benefits in addition to providing tax deferral that other investments may not offer, including death benefit protection for your beneficiaries and annuity options which guarantee income for life. You should consult with your financial professional as to whether the overall benefits and costs of an annuity are appropriate considering your circumstances.
