Overwhelming demand led Sanderson to open his own Chiswick wallpaper factory, but in 1870, only three years after production began, Arthur died leaving his sons in charge. Under their leadership, staff increased from 40 to 300 and the first printing machine was joined by seven more. Technical improvements reaped their rewards and in 1902 the Chiswick factory was given a new extension, designed by the celebrated Arts and Crafts architect and designer CFA Voysey. The Voysey extension still stands, having become a Chiswick landmark. This period of success continued and in 1924, Arthur Sanderson & Sons was awarded the Royal Warrant as Purveyors of Wallpapers to the King George V. In 1928 a fire devastated the Chiswick works and consequently a new factory was built, set in 80 acres of land in Perivale. This state-of-the-art factory, which produced wallpaper until 1975 was described in the press as "the finest wallpaper mill in the world…a magnificent factory flanked by gardens and playing fields…a glimpse of a new ideal in industry."Sanderson’s 100th birthday was celebrated in style with extensions to the Uxbridge factory and a cutting-edge showroom built in Berners Street, complete with a fabulous stained-glass window by John Piper and Jacob Epstein bust of Ivan Sanderson in the lobby. In the same year, Sanderson launched Triad, the first ever collection of co-ordinated fabric and wallpaper.Say it with flowersAlthough its range has always been diverse, Sanderson established a reputation for its floral furnishing fabrics as long ago as the 1930s. With its distinctive designs well known throughout the world, this inheritance, combined equally with inspiration from nature, forms Sanderson’s iconic handwriting.Celebrating 160 yearsWith an exciting series of events planned to mark Sanderson’s 160th year, there’s much to look forward to. So, whether you’re new to the world of Sanderson or rekindling an old love affair, there’s nothing more enchanting than the familiarity of an iconic floral or the memories of a countryside walk.Discover the Sanderson community to discover our latest products and be first to recieve the latest news.
