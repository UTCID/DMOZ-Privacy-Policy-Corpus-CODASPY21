If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("the CCPA") provides you with certain rights relating to the data that Experian has collected about you. Those rights include:
The right to know the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell about you, the categories of sources from which we collected your personal information, our purposes for collecting or selling your personal information, the categories of your personal information that we have either sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties with which we have shared personal information.
The right to opt out of our sale of your personal information. Please note that if you opt out of certain types of sales, we and businesses that rely on that data may be unable to provide you with the services that rely on such sales.
The right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected directly from you. We use a two-step process for online requests to delete. You will be asked to clearly submit your request to delete and to separately confirm your choice.

Please note that you may have additional rights under state and federal laws separate from your rights under the CCPA. Those laws include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The protections provided by those laws are separate from your rights under the CCPA and may apply in place of some of the rights under the CCPA.
