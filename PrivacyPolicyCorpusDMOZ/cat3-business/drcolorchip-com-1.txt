Return Policy & Color Match Guarantee
COLOR MATCH GUARANTEE
We guarantee our paint will match the original OEM factory color chip.
PLEASE CONFIRM THE ACCURACY OF THE COLOR MATCH UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR ORDER.
WE HAVE A 60 DAY LIMIT ON PRODUCT RETURNS OR ISSUES WITH COLOR MATCH.
COLOR MATCH ISSUES
Our paints are mixed by hand one at a time, and while we're pretty darn good, we can occasionally screw up an order. If it’s our fault, we'll do our best to correct it and ship you another bottle at no charge. If we can't get it right, we'll refund your purchase price upon return of the kit - guaranteed.
In the event you test the paint and determine it is not a good match, we will try to work with you to solve the problem. Please contact us and describe the discrepancy.
We may ask you to send us back a sample of the paint we originally provided. You will need to apply a quarter size sample of the paint on a business card size piece of paper and mail it back to us along with this color match form (pdf download). Please complete the form and be sure to include your order number.
DO NOT RETURN THE PAINT KIT UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDED A RETURN AUTHORIZATION NUMBER.
Kits returned to us without this information will be refused and/or will not be refunded.

VERIFY YOUR COLOR CODE
Our searchable database is meant to be used as a guide to help our customers determine their color.
The color chips displayed are computer generated and often do not closely resemble the actual color.
Because of this, to ensure that you receive the correct color, you must confirm the color code from your vehicle.
Use our OEM code matching database to look up your color. If you can’t find your car/code in our database, please refer to our color code identification plate diagram to find the location of the color code on your vehicle.
Once you have been able to locate the code for your car, type this information into the text box when placing your order on our website along with the year, make and model of your car and the color description.
In most cases, if we have your color code, even if it is not found in our database, we can provide you with the color.
THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS FOR CUSTOMERS ORDERING THE WRONG PAINT.
We provide a custom product.
Each order is processed individually as it is received for that particular customer.
We cannot resell old paint and therefore we do not allow for returns or refunds for any of the following reasons:
You have changed your mind and no longer want the kit.
You sold the car.
You decided to take the car in to have it professionally repaired.
You couldn’t get the repairs made to your satisfaction.
While we do guarantee the color match of your paint if we have a sample to match to, we can't guarantee that it will repair all types of damage to each individual's satisfaction.
We do know that we offer the best product for paint chip repair, and if used properly for this type of damage it will produce excellent results.
We try to provide as much information as possible on our website to help our customers decide if our product is the right choice for the repairs they are looking to make. Please review our faq/product support information to better understand if our system is the best option for your particular needs.
We are reasonable and do listen to our customers and retain the right at our discretion to accept returns and issue refunds. Please contact us for more information.
