Overview
Cerner Corporation, its subsidiaries and its affiliates ("Cerner") are committed to protecting the privacy and security of their users. Cerner’s goal is to provide you with a personalized internet experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, Cerner sometimes collects information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from other users of Cerner websites. Cerner operates under the following set of strict privacy principles:
The only personal information Cerner obtains about individual users to its websites is that supplied voluntarily by users.
In cases when Cerner may need personal information to provide users with customized content or to inform them about new features or services, users are explicitly asked for that information.
Personally identifiable information provided by users (name, e-mail or home address, etc.) will only be disclosed to agents action on Cerner's behalf subject to an agreement ensuring Cerner's privacy priniciples and will not be disclosed to non-agent-third party unless users choose that Cerner may do so, or unless required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, or in litigation or dispute resolution.
Only statistical non-personal information about Cerner website users as a group (usage habits, demographics) may be shared with any sponsor, advertiser or partner of Cerner, unless an appropriate confidentiality agreement is in place. Cerner employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions. All personal information is stored in a secured database.

What Information is Collected
Cerner collects certain information from its users in three ways: (a) from Cerner web server logs, (b) with cookies and (c) directly from the user.
(a) IP Addresses (Server Log Information)
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the internet. All computer identification on the web is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Cerner collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, advertisers or partners, and to conduct site analysis. Cerner will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to comply with Cerner's Terms of Use Agreement, and to identify users who threaten Cerner’s service, site, user, clients or others.
(b) Cookies
Cerner uses cookies as described in our cookie policy.
