Use of cookies

Personal information
At Midé, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Midé on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we may need—to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example—it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it. We have implemented these practices for the Midé Home Page (www.mide.com).
