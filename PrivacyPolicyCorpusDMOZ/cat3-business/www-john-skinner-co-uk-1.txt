Coronavirus Update (November 2020)
We continue to remain open and functional.
We have implemented many changes to our factory unit, and our staff are working staggered hours to allow for better social distancing. Some staff, however, still cannot return to work due to vulnerable situations and childcare/school issues.
We are doing our best to manage and cope – and we continue to appreciate your patience during this time.  Whilst your life may have returned to normal, this, unfortunately, is not the case for all of us, so please keep this in mind. Remember, our number one priority is the health and safety of our staff.
Enquiries
At this present time, we would prefer enquiries via email/contact form as this allows Jonathon Skinner to focus his efforts on the production floor.
However, we are happy to arrange a call back to discuss the finer points of your enquiry, so please do let us know.
Production/Lead Times/Shipping
Production of parts and shipping is on-going.
Due to the aforementioned issues, production time/lead times continue to be affected.
Plan Wisely for the Future
In our view, 2020 should essentially be written-off as most car shows and events have been or will be cancelled. Instead of panicking, rushing and getting frustrated about the situation – use the remaining months of the year wisely. Take your time and restore your car to the level it deserves using a Skinner Kit. When the season arrives in 2021, you will benefit from your hard work and patience undertaken during this testing year.
Thank you all, once again, for your continued support and most of all your patience during these strange times.
Stay healthy,
The John Skinner Team
