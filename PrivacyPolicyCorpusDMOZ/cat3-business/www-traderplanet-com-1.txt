No Advice or Solicitation.  TraderPlanet
does not advocate the purchase or sale of any security or investment and no

recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities,
transaction or investment strategy is suitable for You or any specific person.
The TraderPlanet Services are provided for informational purposes only. The
TraderPlanet Services and all Content and Products provided on or through it
should not be construed as investment, financial, insurance, tax, legal or
other advice.  TraderPlanet does not provide personalized investment or
financial advice or make solicitations, recommendations, endorsements or offers
to buy or sell stocks, futures, commodities, options, Forex, or any other
security, financial instrument or investment.
No
Content on the TraderPlanet Services is intended to provide personally tailored
advice concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular
security, portfolio or securities, transaction, investment strategy or other
matter.

the extent that any of the Content published on the TraderPlanet Services may
be deemed to be investment advice or recommendations in connection with a
particular security, such Content is impersonal and not tailored to the
investment needs of any specific person. You understand that an investment in
any security or financial instrument is subject to a number of risks and that
discussion of any security or financial instrument published on the
TraderPlanet Services will not contain a list or description of relevant risk
factors. You acknowledge that some of the stocks that may be discussed on the
TraderPlanet Services may have a low market capitalization or insufficient
public float. Such stocks may be subject to more risk than stocks of
larger companies, including greater volatility, lower liquidity and less
publicly available information.
Market

TraderPlanet Services, as well as links to other websites, are for general
informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as
investment advice.  You understand that the TraderPlanet Services may
contain opinions from time to time with regard to securities or financial instruments

contractors, and other Members of TraderPlanet including investors and
bloggers) who provide Content that is posted on the TraderPlanet Services may,
from time to time, hold positions in the financial instruments discussed at the
time of writing and they may trade for their own accounts, and that they may or
may not be subject to a disclosure policy. In addition, certain Content
contributors may be subject to restrictions on trading for their own account.
You understand and agree that at the time of any transaction that You make, one
or more Content contributors or their affiliates may have a position in the
financial instruments written about.
You
acknowledge that any reliance upon or use of the Content or Products shall be
entirely at your sole risk. You should not rely solely on the Content or
Products, in making any investment or trading decision.  Rather, You
should do your own independent research and due diligence in order to allow You
to form your own opinion regarding your investments and trading
decisions.  You should always discuss and/or review your trading
strategies and decisions with your broker or other professional advisor. The
Content, which is neither comprehensive nor appropriate for every individual,
is obtained from sources (some of which may be compensated for the Content),
considered by TraderPlanet to be reliable, but the accuracy, adequacy,
appropriateness, suitability, validity, completeness or timeliness thereof are
not guaranteed, and the Content is provided without respect to any individual
investor’s or trader’s financial sophistication, financial circumstances, risk
capital, risk propensity or tolerance, or investing time horizon.

independent contractors are, in such capacities, registered investment
advisors, licensed financial advisors, commodity trading advisors, registered
brokers or broker dealers, nor are they in the business of transacting trades,
nor do they direct client commodity accounts or give commodity trading advice tailored
to any particular client’s situation.

should always consult with your broker or other financial advisor. No
responsibility is hereby assumed by TraderPlanet for evaluating the merits and
risks associated with the use of any Content or Products provided on the
TraderPlanet Services or by any other means. You alone are solely responsible
for any investment decisions that You make and for determining whether any
investment, security, strategy, or any Content or Product is appropriate or
suitable for You based on your investment objectives and personal and financial
situation.

of your Personal Information, and furthermore that any action taken or Content
posted, uploaded or transmitted using your Personal Information shall be deemed
made by You for the purpose of accrual of your indemnity obligation.
You
may not allow concurrent use of the TraderPlanet Website by multiple Users
utilizing identical Personal Information, or allow another person or entity to
use or share your Personal Information as these are violations of this
Agreement and may result in suspension or termination of your Member status
without prior notice, in TraderPlanet’s sole determination. You agree that You
will immediately notify TraderPlanet of any unauthorized use of your Personal
Information, or if You have reason to believe that your Account security has
been breached for any reason to avoid possible liability for unauthorized
charges to your Account or unauthorized use of any rewards or credits that You
have accrued as a result of your participation in any one of TraderPlanet’s
reward programs (“Reward Program”), and that You will log off the TraderPlanet
Services at the end of each session to prevent fraud on your Account by third

TraderPlanet Services and may elect not to post your postings for any reason at
any time in its sole discretion.
TraderPlanet
reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without any obligation, to

or liability.
TraderPlanet

whole or in part, at any time for any reason, that in TraderPlanet’s sole and
absolute discretion are objectionable or in violation of this Agreement, but is

postings that You submitted to the TraderPlanet Services as necessary or
appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, and
to operate the TraderPlanet Services as TraderPlanet sees fit in its sole
discretion. TraderPlanet will not intentionally monitor or disclose any private
electronic-mail message unless required by law, but reserves the right to
refuse to post any information, content, materials or blog entries, in whole or
in part, that, in its sole discretion, are considered unacceptable, offensive,
undesirable, inappropriate or in violation of this Agreement in any
manner.
Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement, TraderPlanet does not endorse any Content in
any way. If You become aware of misuse of the TraderPlanet Services by any
person, please contact TraderPlanet or click on the “Notify Planet Patrol” link
on any TraderPlanet Member’s personal Block page. Use of the TraderPlanet
Services constitutes consent to such monitoring.
In
using the TraderPlanet Services or receiving e-mail messages from other
Members, You should not assume that such messages have been reviewed or
approved by TraderPlanet, that such messages or postings contain correct information,
or that the Members posting such information have accurately identified
themselves and/or their affiliation with any third party person or entity.
Viruses. TraderPlanet
does not guarantee that files available for downloading through the TraderPlanet
Website will be free of infection or viruses or other code that may have
contaminating or destructive properties. You are responsible for implementing
sufficient procedures and routines that satisfy your particular requirements
for integrity, security and accuracy of data input and output, and for
maintaining a means external to the TraderPlanet Website for the reconstruction
of any lost data.
Subscriber Services and Corporate
Members.   TraderPlanet reserves the right to impose
fees quoted in U.S. Dollars (which may be billed either on a pay-per-usage
basis or in regular time increments, i.e. either monthly or yearly) or other
conditions or prerequisites for the use of or access to areas of the
TraderPlanet Services or certain Content (hereinafter “Subscriber Services”),
and for Members which are business entities, which have registered their
Company Profile to signify themselves as corporate members (“Corporate
Members”) of the TraderPlanet Website, which allow such Corporate Members to
use the TraderPlanet Services and to create customized corporate profiles in
accordance with TraderPlanet’s corporate membership program which is
incorporated herein by reference. All fees paid will be non-refundable in the
event that You violate any of the terms of this Agreement.  Subscriber
Services may include terms and conditions that supplement this Agreement. By
accessing any Subscriber Services You agree to comply with their terms and
conditions.
Rules for Contests, Sweepstakes, Raffles
and Promotions.  TraderPlanet may, from time to time, and at its
sole discretion, offer its Members a reward program (“Reward Program”)
comprised of various rewards or credits (including financial rewards) based on
their activities on the TraderPlanet Website and use of the TraderPlanet
Services. Any such Reward Program comes with no contractual obligations
whatsoever on behalf of any party and is purely a voluntary, promotional Reward
Program that TraderPlanet may decide, at its sole discretion, to offer to or
withhold from certain Members, and Members will be free to accept or decline as
they see fit. The criteria for selection of rewards or credits may be changed
and the size of the rewards or credits comprising any Reward Program (including
the monetary value of Mendels that are either credited to You through your use
of the TraderPlanet Services or acquired by You for financial consideration as
determined by TraderPlanet  in its sole discretion) may be changed or
modified, or the rewards may be terminated or withdrawn, at any time, by
TraderPlanet, in its sole discretion, without prior notice.  Members who
fail to abide by this Agreement, or otherwise engage in behavior deemed
inappropriate by TraderPlanet in its sole discretion may be, at TraderPlanet’s
sole discretion, disqualified from participation in any Rewards Program or
promotions and/or banned from the TraderPlanet Website without prior notice.
All applicable taxes, if any, that may result from Members choosing to accept
financial rewards from TraderPlanet are the sole responsibility of the Members.
In
addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any contests, charity
functions, Reward Programs, credits or other promotions (including trading
contests, sweepstakes, raffles) (collectively, "Promotions") made
available through the TraderPlanet Website or TraderPlanet Services may be
governed by specific terms and conditions that are separate from this
Agreement. You should review the specific terms and conditions for a particular
Promotion to determine whether or not You are eligible to participate in such
Promotion. By participating in any such Promotion, You will become subject to
any specific terms and conditions applicable to such Promotion, which may vary
from the terms and conditions set forth herein. To the extent that the terms
and conditions of any such Promotion conflict with this Agreement, the terms
and conditions of such Promotion shall control.
Liability for Unauthorized Use or Disclosure.  Licensee acknowledges and
agrees that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, its breach
or threatened breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to any
unauthorized use or disclosure of the Content, will diminish the value of
TraderPlanet and the TraderPlanet Services and will cause irreparable and
continuing damage to TraderPlanet for which an adequate legal remedy will not
exist. Accordingly, Licensee stipulates that, if it breaches any of its
covenants in this Agreement, TraderPlanet will be entitled to an entry of a
court order granting specific performance or injunctive relief, without
requirement of a bond or proof of monetary damage or an inadequate remedy at
law, to protect its rights under this Agreement, in addition to all other
remedies available at law or in equity.
Violation of Terms and Liquidated Damages.  You understand and agree that,
because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for
TraderPlanet to pursue legal action to enforce this Agreement, your access to
the TraderPlanet Website and the TraderPlanet Services will be terminated in
TraderPlanet’s sole determination, You will forfeit any credits that you had
previously accrued in your Member Account through your prior participation in
any Promotions, and You will be liable to pay TraderPlanet the following
amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of
TraderPlanet’s damages for the specified breaches of these Terms and
Conditions:
a.
If You post a message or content that (1) impersonates any person or entity;
(2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or
entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about another
person without that person’s explicit consent, You agree to pay TraderPlanet
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each such posting.  This provision
does not apply to Content that constitutes lawful non-deceptive parody of
public figures.
b.
If TraderPlanet establishes limits on the frequency with which You may access
the TraderPlanet Services, or terminates your access to or use of the
TraderPlanet Services, You agree to pay TraderPlanet one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day that
You access TraderPlanet in excess of such limits, whichever is greater.
c.
If You send unsolicited email advertisements to TraderPlanet email addresses or
through TraderPlanet’s servers or computer systems, You agree to pay
TraderPlanet fifty dollars ($50.00) for each such email.
d.
If you post Content in violation of this Agreement, other than as described
above, You agree to pay TraderPlanet one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
Item of Content posted.  In its sole discretion, TraderPlanet may elect to
issue a warning before assessing damages.
e.
If You are a Posting Agent and use the TraderPlanet Services in violation of
this Agreement, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), You
agree to pay TraderPlanet one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each and every Item
You post in violation of this Agreement.  A Posting Agent will also be
deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the
TraderPlanet Services (the "Principal Party"), and the Principal
Party (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of this Agreement) agrees to
pay TraderPlanet an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each Item
posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the Principal Party in violation of
this Agreement.
f.
If You aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for
any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of this
Agreement without TraderPlanet’s prior, express written permission, You agree
to pay TraderPlanet  three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) for each day that
You engage in such conduct.
You
hereby agree that such damages are a reasonable estimate of actual damages and
You waive your right to contest these damages in a court of law or other
proceeding. Otherwise, You agree to pay TraderPlanet’s actual damages, to the
extent such actual damages can be reasonably determined. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, TraderPlanet retains the right to seek the
remedy of specific performance of any term contained in this Agreement, or a
preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Agreement, or any combination
thereof.
Limitations of Liability.  TraderPlanet Indemnities are not responsible
for any actions taken by You based upon your use of any of the Content or
Products on the TraderPlanet Services including those Products (hereinafter
“Third Party Services”) offered by third parties on the TraderPlanet Website

no responsibility or liability for any loss or damage of any kind including
your trading and investment results incurred as a result of your use of any

The

submission of postings through the TraderPlanet Services or the placement or

infringement by You or others who use the TraderPlanet Services using your computer,
of any intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity.
TraderPlanet reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive
defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You,

in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of
the use of any Content posted, e-mailed, or otherwise transmitted by way of the
TraderPlanet Services or by any other means. The opinions expressed in the
Content reflect solely the opinions of the party who submitted such opinions,
and may not reflect the opinions of TraderPlanet.
You acknowledge and agree that the TraderPlanet Indemnities neither endorse the
contents of any postings that become part of the Content nor assume responsibility
for any threatening, libelous, obscene, harassing, abusive, defamatory,
illegal, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, fraudulent, pornographic, profane or
otherwise objectionable or offensive material or information of any kind
contained therein, any infringement of third party intellectual property rights
arising therefrom or any crime facilitated thereby. TraderPlanet has no
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or availability of content or

You
specifically acknowledge and agree that the TraderPlanet  Indemnities
shall not be liable for any offensive, illegal or defamatory conduct of any
User of the TraderPlanet Services and that the TraderPlanet Indemnities shall
have no responsibility for the accuracy, suitability, timeliness, completeness,
legality, correct sequencing, reliability, quality, security, appropriateness
or availability of any Content or Products displayed on the TraderPlanet
Services, including Third Party Services offered on the TraderPlanet Website or
available on Third Party Resources, including links provided as automated
search results nor for any loss or damages caused or alleged to have been
caused by the use of or reliance on any such content.
The
links on the TraderPlanet Services may provide You with access to other
websites including Third Party Resources where the trading of securities,
commodities, futures, options and/or Forex is possible.  TraderPlanet
Indemnities shall not be responsible or liable with regard to any trading which

If
any applicable authority holds any portion of this section of this Agreement to
be unenforceable, then the liability of the TraderPlanet Indemnities will be
limited to the fullest possible extent permitted by applicable law. You agree
that this paragraph constitutes a conspicuous legend.
To
the maximum extent permitted by law, the TraderPlanet Indemnities disclaim any
and all liability in the event any information, commentary, analysis, opinions,
or recommendations on the TraderPlanet Services are inaccurate, incomplete or
unreliable or result in any investment or other losses.
Links to Third Party Resources;
Advertisers not Endorsed. TraderPlanet encourages You to
exercise discretion while using the TraderPlanet Services, as well as browsing
Third Party Resources on the Internet after clicking on hyperlinks placed on
the TraderPlanet Services, including links from profiles created and posted by
Members, since hyperlinks may direct You to Third Party Resources containing
information or advertisements that are inappropriate to your investment and
trading needs and capabilities, inaccurate, objectionable or unlawful. TraderPlanet
takes no responsibility for claims or representations made by third party
advertisers and sponsors, which are posted on the TraderPlanet Website or
available through the TraderPlanet Services, nor does it assume any
responsibility for the Products offered by its advertisers.
TraderPlanet
does not control, endorse or sponsor the Third Party Resources, their owners or
operators, and is not responsible for the privacy practices or security of
these sites, nor has it reviewed or approved any Products, information,
advertising, content, or opinions that appear on such Third Party Resources,
and such Third Party Resources are in no way investigated, monitored or checked
for accuracy or completeness by TraderPlanet. When You access these Third Party
Resources, You do so at your own risk. Links to Third Party Resources may be
discontinued at any time without notice.
Business Conducted with Merchants. If You purchase Products on or
through the TraderPlanet Services (including from Third Party Resources), You
may be asked to supply certain information, including credit card or other
payment mechanism information. You agree that all such information You provide
to any parties including other Members through the TraderPlanet Services or
through Third Party Resources will be accurate, complete and current. The
Merchants set their own prices and may change prices or institute new prices at
any time. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your account and
credit card or other payment mechanism at the prices in effect when such
charges are incurred. You also will be responsible for paying any applicable
taxes relating to purchases through the TraderPlanet Services.
Your
correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of,
Merchants found on or through the TraderPlanet Services (including those found
on Third Party Resources), including payment and delivery of related goods or
services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations
associated with such dealings, are solely between You and such Merchant and You
acknowledge and agree that TraderPlanet is not responsible or liable, directly
or indirectly, for any loss, damage or claim of any sort including the misuse
of any Personal Information or data submitted by You to an advertiser on the
TraderPlanet Website or Third Party Resources, caused or alleged to be caused
by or in connection with any such dealings by You with Merchants or your use of
or reliance on Third Party Services available on the TraderPlanet Services or
on Third Party Resources.
If
there is a dispute between You and any third party (including, without
limitation, any Member or Merchant), TraderPlanet is under no obligation to
become involved; however, We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to
monitor disputes between You and other Members or Merchants.
Speculative Nature.   Licensee
acknowledges and understands the speculative nature of the commodities futures
and financial markets and recognizes the high degree of risk involved in participating
in such markets, with or without the access to and use of the TraderPlanet
Services.  Licensee also acknowledges that the Content or Products
furnished by TraderPlanet through the TraderPlanet Services or by any other
means is not intended to replace Licensee’s individual research or receipt of
professional investment advice, and that the provision of Content or Products
on the TraderPlanet Services or by any other means does not constitute the
provision of trading advice or an endorsement or recommendation by TraderPlanet
of any trading methods, programs, systems, or routines, based on, or tailored
to, any positions or other circumstances or characteristics of Licensee or
anyone else, or otherwise.
Licensee
further acknowledges that individual performance in the financial markets
depends upon individual skills and experience at performing technical,
fundamental and intermarket analysis, knowledge of and familiarity with the
markets, effectiveness of individual decision making and decisiveness, and time
availability to devote to analyzing and trading the markets.
TraderPlanet  MAKES NO GUARANATEE OF PERFORMANCE EITHER IN THIS AGREEMENT
OR OTHERWISE AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES THAT LICENSEE WILL MAKE
PROFITS AND/OR NOT SUFFER ANY LOSSES FROM TRADING BASED ON, OR IN RELIANCE ON,
THE TraderPlanet SERVICES OR THE USE THEREOF.   LICENSEE ASSUMES FULL
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE HIS OR ITS OWN TRADING DECISIONS INVOLVING ENTRIES,
EXITS, AND STOP PLACEMENTS, BASED UPON HIS OR ITS OWN ASSESSMENT OF HIS OR ITS
TRADING STYLE, OBJECTIVES, RISK PROPENSITY, RISK CAPITAL, EXPERTISE AND
EXPERIENCE AS A TRADER ALL OF WHICH CAN INFLUENCE LICENSEE’S TRADING RESULTS
SUCH THAT HIS OR ITS  PERFORMANCE RESULTS MAY BE BETTER OR WORSE THAN THAT
OF OTHER TRADERS INCLUDING THOSE WHO MAY ALSO BE ACCESSING AND USING THE
TraderPlanet SERVICES  AT THE SAME TIME. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE
TraderPlanet INDEMNITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSEE’S TRADING RESULTS OR
PERFORMANCE BASED UPON THE TRADING DECISIONS THAT LICENSEE MAKES.
FURTHERMORE, IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY
INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  LICENSEE AGREES
THAT NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE OR HAS BEEN MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT OR TRADE
WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN ON THE
TraderPlanet SERVICES OR IN ANY OF TraderPlanet ‘S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, OR
ELSEWHERE.  IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED
BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.  ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL
PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF
HINDSIGHT.  IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL
RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT
OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO
WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF
TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL
TRADING RESULTS.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS,
IN GENERAL, OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM, WHICH
CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE
RESULTS, AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.
TraderPlanet   HAS HAD LITTLE OR NO EXPERIENCE IN TRADING ACTUAL
ACCOUNTS FOR ITSELF OR FOR CUSTOMERS.  SINCE THERE ARE NO ACTUAL TRADING
RESULTS TO COMPARE TO THE HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS, LICENSEE SHOULD BE
PARTICULARLY WARY OF PLACING UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE
RESULTS. ALSO, SINCE THE TRADES HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, THE RESULTS MAY HAVE
UNDER-OR-OVER COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS,
SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. There is a very high degree of risk involved in
trading securities, commodities, futures, options and Forex.  Past results
of any trader written about or referred to in the Content are not indicative of
future returns by that trader, and are not indicative of future returns which
may be realized by You or others.  The past performance of any trading
system or methodology is not necessarily indicative of future results. You
should not trade with money that You can not afford to lose.
Force Majeure. TraderPlanet
and the TraderPlanet Indemnities are not responsible for any problems or
technical malfunction of any telephone network or lines, servers or providers,
computer online systems, computer equipment, software, failure of any email or
players due to technical problems or traffic congestion on the Internet or on
any of the TraderPlanet Services or combination thereof, including any injury
or damage to User’s or to any other person’s computer related to or resulting
from participating in, or downloading materials from, the TraderPlanet
Services. Under no circumstances shall TraderPlanet and the TraderPlanet
Indemnities be responsible for any loss or damage, including personal injury or
death, resulting from use of the TraderPlanet Services; from attendance at a
TraderPlanet sponsored event; from any Content or Product posted on or through
the TraderPlanet Services; from the conduct of, or interactions with, any
Merchant or User of the TraderPlanet Services, whether online or offline; from
any interruption, omission, defect, error, deletion, delay in operation or
transmission, communications line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized
access to, or alteration of, any User communications; or from occurrences
beyond TraderPlanet’s control, including but not limited to acts of
governmental authority, weather, fire, floods, explosions, acts of God, strikes
or other concerted acts of workers, riots, armed conflicts, acts of war,
sabotage or terrorism, whether or not characterized in negligence, tort,
contract, strict liability or other theory of liability and irrespective of any
failure of an essential purpose of a limited remedy, even if TraderPlanet or
the TraderPlanet Indemnities have been advised of the possibility of or could
have foreseen any of the Excluded Damages.
Disclaimer of Warranties.  You expressly understand and agree that your
use of the TraderPlanet Website and the TraderPlanet Services is entirely at
your sole risk. Access to and use of the TraderPlanet Services (including the
Content and Products available on the TraderPlanet Services), or through the

errors in the Third Party Services that may require changes and correction at
any time, without notice. To the fullest extent permitted by law the
TraderPlanet Indemnities specifically disclaim any and all representations or
warranties, express, implied or statutory, including without limitation, any
representations or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose or warranties concerning the availability, accuracy,
completeness, timeliness, quality, suitability for your needs, quiet enjoyment,

that the results obtained from the use of the TraderPlanet Services (comprising
both the Content and the Products), including Third Party Services will be
reliable, correct, error-free, timely, secure, complete, accurate, effective,
profitable or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to You.
All
liability for errors or omissions in, or the misinterpretation, transmission,
translation or misuse of, any of the Content and Products on the TraderPlanet
Services (including the Third Party Services available on the TraderPlanet
Services or on Third Party Resources) is hereby expressly disclaimed. YOU
EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
TraderPlanet SERVICES AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT IS
ASSUMED SOLELY BY YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE PROVISIONS, IF THERE SHALL AT
ANY TIME BE OR ARISE ANY LIABILITY ON THE PART OF TraderPlanet OR ITS LICENSORS
BY VIRTUE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP THEREBY ESTABLISHED,
WHETHER DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF TRADERPLANET OR ITS LICENSORS OR OTHERWISE,
SUCH LIABILITY IS AND SHALL BE LIMITED TO A SUM EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE LESSER
OF TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE SUMS PAID TO TRADERPLANET  BY YOU, IF ANY,
UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR $100.00, AS LIMITED DAMAGES AND NOT
AS A PENALTY. THIS LIABILITY SHALL BE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE. SOME STATES DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Exclusion of Damages.  You agree to indemnify, release, defend, and
hold harmless the TraderPlanet Indemnities from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, demand, causes of actions, costs, lost profits, lost
opportunities, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
punitive, or any other damages whatsoever and expenses (including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) asserted against,
resulting from, imposed upon or incurred by any of the TraderPlanet
Indemnities as a result of, or arising out of this Agreement and/or your
use of, misuse of, inability to use, or reliance upon, the TraderPlanet
Services or the placement, posting or transmission of any materials, content,
blogs or messages comprising Member Content posted by You onto the TraderPlanet
Services. These exclusions apply to any claims for lost profits, lost data,
work stoppage, loss of goodwill, computer malfunction or failure, or any other
commercial damages or losses, even if We knew or should have known of the
possibility of such damages.
Your
sole and exclusive remedy for any dissatisfaction with the TraderPlanet Services
or dispute with TraderPlanet is to discontinue your use of the TraderPlanet
Services. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such
states or jurisdictions, the liability of the TraderPlanet Indemnities shall be
limited to the extent permitted by law.
Indemnification.  In part consideration of the license granted herein,
Licensee agrees to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
TraderPlanet Indemnities and waives with respect to each Indemnity, and
covenants not to sue any Indemnity for, any and all liabilities, claims, cost,
demands, actions, causes of action, suits or proceedings, damages, losses and
expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs)
of any nature whatsoever (collectively, the “Liabilities”) arising out of or in
connection with Licensee’s use of the TraderPlanet Website or TraderPlanet
Services, including those arising out of the Member Content You submit, post or
make available through the TraderPlanet Services, your violation of this
Agreement, your breach of any of the representation and warranties herein, or
the infringement or violation by You of any intellectual property or other
rights of any person or entity, whether you are a Member or not. Such hold
harmless, release, discharge, waiver and covenant not to sue shall include but
not be limited to any Liabilities caused, in whole or in part, by the
negligence (of any type) of any TraderPlanet Indemnity in connection with the
TraderPlanet Website or TraderPlanet Services or the promotion or marketing
thereof.
TraderPlanet
may assume the exclusive defense and control at your expense of any claim or
matter subject to indemnification by You, and in such case, without limiting
your other obligations hereunder, You agree to cooperate with and pay for all
expenses incurred in the defense of such claim.
Member Feedback.  From time-to-time TraderPlanet may provide you with a
mechanism to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, and information (“Feedback”)
beneficial to the overall User experience on the TraderPlanet Website. Your
participation is completely voluntary and You have the choice of whether or not
to disclose Feedback. You agree that TraderPlanet.com may, in its sole
discretion, use the Feedback that You provide to it in any way, including in
future modifications to the TraderPlanet Services, and You hereby grant
TraderPlanet.com a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, irrevocable, royalty
free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from,

technically and legally possible in the areas of the world where You intend to

Agreement is expressly made subject to any laws, regulations, orders, rules or
other restrictions on the export from the United States of America of the

accompanying the Software, then the terms in this Section shall govern your use

Modification to the TraderPlanet
Services and Agreement.  TraderPlanet reserves the right,
in its sole discretion, to change the terms and conditions of this Agreement from
time to time for any reason, by posting such changes on the TraderPlanet
Website, and to change, modify, suspend or discontinue the TraderPlanet
Services (or any parts thereof), temporarily or permanently, including but not
limited to revising and/or eliminating or discontinuing any aspect, content,
features or other Content on or available through the TraderPlanet Services
without prior notice to You.  You agree that the TraderPlanet Indemnities
shall not be liable to You or to any third party for any modification,
suspension or discontinuance of the TraderPlanet Services.
You
acknowledge that TraderPlanet may establish general practices and limits
concerning your use of the TraderPlanet Services (and may modify such practices
and limits from time to time), including the maximum number of days that
Content will be retained by the TraderPlanet Services, the maximum number and
size of postings, email messages, or other Content that may be transmitted or
stored by the TraderPlanet Services, and the frequency with which You may
access the TraderPlanet Services.
You
are responsible for checking this Agreement on the TraderPlanet Website on a
regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes to ensure familiarity
with the most current version of this Agreement.  Display of notice of
changes of this Agreement online at the TraderPlanet Website shall constitute
effective notice under this Agreement on the day TraderPlanet places the
changes on-line on its TraderPlanet Website, and your continued use of the
TraderPlanet Website thereafter shall constitute and signify your acceptance of
the new terms and conditions and agreement to be bound by any such
modifications, amendments, additions or deletions.
Third Party Applications.  Your access to or use of the TraderPlanet
Services may require your use of a media player or other application that is
not provided by TraderPlanet and for which TraderPlanet is not liable. Your use
of such media player or other application will be governed by the license
agreement accompanying the same, and You agree to comply with all of the terms
and conditions of such license agreement.
Correctional Institution Inmates
Prohibited.   Inmates at any jail, prison, or
correctional institution are expressly prohibited from using the TraderPlanet
Services. By agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, You
acknowledge that You are not currently incarcerated in any jail, prison, or
correctional facility of any kind and further agree not to allow your Account
to be used by any inmate at any jail, prison, or other correctional facility.
Competitor Use Prohibited,
Liquidated Damages for Competitive Use. The TraderPlanet
Website and the TraderPlanet Services are to be used for non-competitive
purposes only. Use of the TraderPlanet Website or TraderPlanet Services by
competing businesses, their affiliates, employees, or other associates is
absolutely prohibited and constitutes a breach of this Agreement, giving rise
to substantial damages.  If You are an owner, employee or other associate
of a competing social networking website (other than simply a member), You
hereby agree that damages from the unlicensed visitation of the TraderPlanet
Website are difficult to compute. Damages from breach of this competitor use
provision shall therefore be set at $10,000.00 per unauthorized TraderPlanet
Website visit. You hereby agree that such damages are a reasonable estimate of
actual damages and waive your right to contest these damages in a court of law
or other proceeding.
Cancellation, Termination and
Interruption of Services.  You agree that TraderPlanet
has the right (but not the obligation) to deactivate or delete your Account,
restrict, deny or terminate your access to all or part of the TraderPlanet
Services, block your email or IP address, or otherwise terminate your access to
or use of the TraderPlanet Services (or any part thereof), or remove, edit,
and/or discard any content or postings transmitted by You, or information sent,
stored or received via the TraderPlanet Services, immediately and without prior
notice and for any or no reason, in its sole and absolute discretion, and
without liability, if, in its opinion, it believes that your use of the
TraderPlanet Services may violate any laws, infringe upon another person’s or
entity’s rights, violate any of the terms of the Agreement or is inconsistent
with the letter or spirit of the Agreement, or is otherwise deemed
inappropriate for continued access.
You
also agree that TraderPlanet may in its sole and absolute discretion and at any
time, discontinue providing the TraderPlanet Services, or any part thereof,
with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the
TraderPlanet Services under any provision of this Agreement may be effected
without prior notice and that TraderPlanet reserves the right to bar any
further access to the TraderPlanet Services. You expressly agree and
acknowledge that the TraderPlanet Indemnities shall not be liable to You or any
third-party for any termination of your access to the TraderPlanet Services,
and that this provision is an essential element of our relationship, without
which TraderPlanet  would not offer the TraderPlanet Services to You.
Upon
termination of the TraderPlanet Services, your right to use the TraderPlanet
Services will immediately cease. In the event of such termination TraderPlanet
has no obligation whatsoever to refund any portion of fees paid or compensate
You for any lost use of your privileges under this Agreement or for any credits
that You accrued as a result of your prior use of the TraderPlanet Services,
and You shall have no right and TraderPlanet will have no obligation thereafter
to forward any unread or unsent messages to You or any third party.
If
You have subscribed to any fee-based service, You remain responsible for paying
any amounts owed on your Account at the time your fee-based service and/or
Account is terminated or cancelled. If You are participating in any free
promotional offer for accessing a fee-based service, You must cancel such service
before the end of the free trial period to avoid incurring charges. Certain
fee-based services may require cancellation charges, and You agree to pay all
such cancellation charges.
You
acknowledge and agree that TraderPlanet may, in its sole discretion, deny You
access, through the TraderPlanet Services, to linked Third Party Resources on
the Internet, and TraderPlanet shall have no responsibility to notify any
third-party providers, nor any responsibility for any consequences resulting
from lack of notification.  Termination, suspension or cancellation of
this Agreement or your access rights to the TraderPlanet Services shall not
affect any right or relief to which TraderPlanet may be entitled, at law or in
equity. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to You will
automatically terminate and immediately revert back to TraderPlanet and its
licensors, and You agree not to attempt to use the TraderPlanet Services after
said termination.
You
may cancel your Member status in the TraderPlanet Services with or without
cause at any time by emailing your request TraderPlanet. After cancellation,
You will no longer have access to the Password Protected Member Services and
all information or content of yours contained therein may be deleted by TraderPlanet.
TraderPlanet shall not accept any liability for such deleted information or
content.
All
provisions of this Agreement, except for any license granted to You, survive
any suspension or termination of your Member status or of access to all of or
any part of the TraderPlanet Services.
Communications and Notices.  You agree to receive all
TraderPlanet required communications and notices, including service
announcements, electronic emails, newsletters and administrative messages
("Notices") from us.  WE MAY PROVIDE NOTICES TO YOU
ELECTRONICALLY EITHER BY E-MAIL OR BY POSTING THE NOTICE ON THE TRADERPLANET
WEBSITE. The delivery of any Notice is effective when sent or posted by us,
regardless of whether You read the Notice or actually receive delivery. You can
withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically by terminating your
Member Account and discontinuing your use of the TraderPlanet Services.
Additional Terms.  You acknowledge and agree that the warranty
disclaimers and liability and remedy limitations in this Agreement are material
terms of this Agreement and that they have been taken into account in the
decision by TraderPlanet to give you access to the TraderPlanet Services
hereunder. You may not assign any of your rights, obligations or privileges
hereunder without the prior, written consent of TraderPlanet. Any assignment of
the foregoing other than as provided for in this section shall be null and
void, ab initio.
Severability and Integration.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and TraderPlanet
and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between
us. The failure of TraderPlanet to exercise or enforce any right or provision
of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
any part or provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in
a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the
original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in
full force and effect.
You
agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause
of action arising out of or related to your use of the TraderPlanet Services or
the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
action arose or be forever barred.
