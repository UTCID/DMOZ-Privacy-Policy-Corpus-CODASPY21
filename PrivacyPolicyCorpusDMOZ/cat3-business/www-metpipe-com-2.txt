Product Display/Colors
The Metropolitan Pipe Web site attempts to display product images shown on the site as accurately as possible. However, we cannot guarantee that the color you see matches the product color, as the display of the color depends, in part, upon the monitor you are using.
Errors on Our Site
Prices and availability of products and services are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered, and Metropolitan Pipe reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions including after an order has been submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, Metropolitan Pipe will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may return it in accordance with Metropolitan Pipe’s Return Policy.
Pricing Policy
Online prices and selection generally match those in our stores, but may vary. Prices and offers are subject to change.
Sales Tax Policy
Metropolitan Pipe collects and remits sales tax as required by U.S. law, for transactions in our stores and on metpipe.com. If you’re a tax-exempt entity, we encourage you to use the Contractor Portal to place your order. Please note that the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy and any legal notices may differ on the Contractor Portal.
For assistance with tax-exempt metpipe.com transactions, please call Customer Care at 1-800-638-7473.
Paying for Your Order
You may pay for your orders with our electronic digital coupons (including any gift cards that may be offered), PayPal, Google Checkout or major credit cards issued in the United States of America. Currently, we accept Visa®, MasterCard®, American Express® and Discover® Card.
Generally, credit and debit card are not charged until we either ship the item(s) to you or confirm store availability (at which time you will be charged only for the goods we have actually shipped along with any appropriate taxes or shipping charges). However, we may pre-authorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When paying for a preorder with a debit card you will be charged at the time you place your preorder. Please contact your credit card issuer for more information.
If you ordered a special delivery item, you will be charged when your order is placed. Please also note that special delivery items may not be cancelled once the order has been placed.
Digital coupons are not redeemable toward the purchase of Metropolitan Pipe gift cards.
Using Promotional Codes
Digital Coupons will automatically be redeemed to purchase totals, up to the total purchase amount. Digital Coupons must be used prior to their noted expiration date and within a single transaction. Coupon cannot be replaced if it is lost, stolen, deleted, or if you cancel or return your purchase. In the event of a reduction in price below the coupon value, the excess value of the coupon will not be refunded.
Validating Your Order
After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will check the information you give us for validity, by verifying your method of payment or shipping address. We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us, and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason. If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you have given us with the order.
If your credit or debit card has been charged prior to your order being rejected, Metropolitan Pipe will issue a full refund on that payment method.
Order Acceptance/Confirmation
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. The Metropolitan Pipe Web site reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.
Return Policy
All sales made through the Metropolitan Pipe Web site are subject to Metropolitan Pipe’s return policy. For a complete explanation of the return policy, please review the Returns page located in our Help section.
Order Limitations
We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us, and/or or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason. If we reject your order, we will generally attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you gave us when you placed the order.
Order Limitations/Limited Quantities
Metropolitan Pipe may, at its own discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. Metropolitan Pipe also reserves the right to reject any order you place with us. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same Metropolitan Pipe Web site account, the same credit card, and orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a change to an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address provided at the time the order was made. Metropolitan Pipe reserves the right to limit or prohibit sales to dealers.

Large shipments may be sent via a freight carrier or by Metropolitan Pipe’s own delivery service.
All orders placed on this site are subject to product availability. In the rare event that your order never arrives, notification of lost items must be received within 60 days from receipt of the shipping confirmation e-mail.
Processing Times

Metropolitan Pipe makes no guarantee that your order will ship on the same day it is placed. This processing/handling time is not inclusive of the carriers shipping time.
