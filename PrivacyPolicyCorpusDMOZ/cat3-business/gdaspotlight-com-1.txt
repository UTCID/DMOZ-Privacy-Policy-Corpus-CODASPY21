GDA AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND INSUREDS (COLLECTIVELY, “GDA PARTIES”) MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THE RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, DATA ACCURACY, SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, INFORMATION PROTECTECTION, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. THE GDA PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE FEATURES OF OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE IN TERMS OF THEIR TIMELINESS, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. WHILE WE MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION ON THIS SITE, YOU SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS ALWAYS UP TO DATE OR THAT THIS SITE CONTAINS ALL THE RELEVANT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT GDA OR ANY OF ITS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. GDA UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO VERIFY OR MAINTAIN THE CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR CURRENCY OF SUCH INFORMATION. Governing Law and Jurisdiction These Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy are governed and interpreted under the laws of the State of Texas, United States of America.  By using this Site you hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the courts and arbitration located in Dallas County, Texas, to the exclusion of all others, for any action arising from these Terms and Conditions or GDA’s Privacy Policy.  Furthermore, you hereby agree to waive any right to contest venue or jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas.  You agree that any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to these Terms and Conditions or the Privacy Policy must be commenced within two (2) years from the date of the accrual of the cause of action, and that actions brought after this date will be barred. Use outside of the United States/Void where prohibited This Site is operated by or for GDA.  GDA makes no representation that the information in this Site is appropriate or available for use outside of the United States, and access to this Site from territories where the content of this Site may be illegal is prohibited. If you access this Site from outside the United States, be advised this Site may contain references to products and services that are not available or are prohibited in your country. Those who choose to access this Site from outside of the United States do so based on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws, about which GDA makes no warranties or assumptions. Any offer for any feature, product or service on this Site is void where prohibited. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions and/or GDA’s Privacy Policy (including any claimed breach or breaches thereof) shall be settled by mandatory arbitration in accordance with the laws of the Federal Arbitration Act before a single arbitrator.  If you and GDA cannot agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, then such arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association.  Other than the initial filing fees to be paid by the person or entity bringing the Arbitration, the costs of the arbitration shall be split 50/50; provided, however, that the arbitrator has no ability to award attorneys’ fees or costs incurred on any party’s behalf in connection with any arbitration proceeding.  The Arbitrator is limited to deciding matters as they exist between you and GDA only. The arbitration shall take place in Dallas County, Texas.  The Arbitrator shall follow Texas law, as may apply to a particular claim.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  ARBITRATION MUST BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS NEITHER YOU NOR GDA MAY JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST EACH OTHER OR LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS AS A PLAINTIFF, REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.  Only a court, and not an arbitrator, shall determine the validity and effect of this Class Action Waiver.  If the Class Action Waiver is deemed to be unenforceable, you and GDA agree that this Agreement is otherwise silent as to any party’s ability to bring a class, collective or representative action in arbitration. The Arbitrator may not consider and has no authority to consider any claims alleged as class or collective actions or as a representative matter. As noted, the Arbitrator's authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and GDA only.  Claims of different individuals or entities may not be joined or consolidated in any arbitration between you and GDA, and the Arbitrator has no authority whatsoever over such other claims, unless agreed to in writing by you and GDA. Nonetheless, no arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.   Miscellaneous If any portion of these Terms and Conditions is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that part shall be deemed severable and shall be construed in accordance with applicable law. Such a term will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The failure of GDA to act with respect to a breach of these Terms and Conditions and/or Privacy Policy by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit any party’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. These Terms and Conditions and policies referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between you and GDA for the subject matters discussed herein.  No modification or waiver by GDA of any provisions herein shall be deemed to have been made unless made in writing and signed by Gail Davis.  Notices To request consent or any other notice related to this Site, please send as follows: GDA Speakers3500 Oak Lawn Ave, Suite 740Dallas, Texas 75204  USAinfo@gdaspeakers.com214-420-1999 #5220240
