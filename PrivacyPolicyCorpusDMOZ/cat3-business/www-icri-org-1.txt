Code of Conduct
ICRI Event Code of Conduct The ICRI leadership and staff are committed to providing a vibrant learning environment at all of our events, welcoming people from as many diverse backgrounds as possible. We expect our
events to be a respectful, harassment-free environment for people of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and beliefs.
We’re grateful that our community is positive, friendly and supportive of one another—it’s what makes our events such a draw each year.
In that spirit, the staff, supporters, volunteers, attendees and speakers at ICRI events are expected to:
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Keep conversations professional, respectful and consider other parties’ points of view. In short, don’t make it personal. Passionate conversations are part of solving problems. Disagreements happen all the time, and are necessary to consider difficult
questions.
Remember that the boundaries of good taste, humor, personal space and physical interaction differ from person to person; if you sense someone feels uncomfortable—whether they explicitly state it or not—be respectful of those boundaries.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior. Harassment and inappropriate behavior may include, but are not limited to:
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert emergency services if you notice what you assess to be a dangerous situation or someone in distress. For other violations of this Code of Conduct, you can email gigij@icri.org.
