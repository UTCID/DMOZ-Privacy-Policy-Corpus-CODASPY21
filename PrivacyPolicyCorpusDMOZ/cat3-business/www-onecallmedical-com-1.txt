If you decide to access linked third-party sites, you do so at you your own risk.
One Call cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from One Call because these sites are owned and operated by independent retailers.

One Call reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without liability to you, to immediately terminate your ability to access the Web Site and/or any other service we may provide to you, with or without cause. Without limiting the foregoing, we may terminate your access if we learn you have provided false or misleading information, interfered with other users or the administration of our services, or otherwise not complied with any of the Terms.
12. Indemnity
You shall indemnify and hold harmless One Call, Service Providers, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims or demands, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, alleging or resulting from your use of the Material or your breach of the Terms, including (without limitation) any claim of infringement.
13. General
One Call makes no claims that the Material may be lawfully viewed or downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Materials may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Web Site from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The Terms are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of law principles.

You may not institute any action in any form arising out of the use of the Web Site, the Materials or the Terms more than eighteen (18) months after the cause of action has arisen. If any of the Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, that invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining Terms, which will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any Term will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision. Except as expressly provided in the One Call Membership Agreement, or in another statement by One Call on the Web Site, the Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the use of the Web Site. No changes to the Terms may be made except by a revised posting by us on this page, and no waiver of any Term will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by us.
