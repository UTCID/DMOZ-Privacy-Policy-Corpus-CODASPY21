Prasad A.
I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to you and your team at NASB for funding this loan. In spite of all of the delays and issues caused by sellers, you and your team have patiently stood by me with unwavering support, and helped me as much as possible to close this transaction. Thank you very much!
