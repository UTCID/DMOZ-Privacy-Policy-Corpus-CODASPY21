Privacy Policy
Privacy Rights of
Our Online Visitors
RentGrow Privacy Policy
RentGrow, Inc. (“RentGrow”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and achieving and maintaining the trust of our clients (“RentGrow Clients” or “Clients”) and other users of and visitors to RentGrow websites (collectively, “Visitors”). Central to this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully considers data protection matters across the suite of tenant screening and related products and services offered by RentGrow (“RentGrow Services” or “Services”), including data stored by RentGrow or its parent company on behalf of its Clients and their customers in connection with our Services (“Client Data”), and with respect to “personal data,” as defined by the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and “personal information,” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) (collectively, “personal information”).
Web Sites Covered
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”) who visit the RentGrow Sites. When we collect personal information on the RentGrow Sites, certain additional disclosures, that are specific to the context of our collection and use of the information being collected (e.g. a registration page), may be provided to you. For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those commitments and any such additional privacy policy statements are hereby incorporated into this Privacy Statement.
IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY NOTICE DOES NOT APPLY TO CLIENT DATA. RentGrow’s confidentiality/privacy and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data (as defined in the agreements for those Services), are governed solely by the agreements under which the Services are provided to our Clients. The traditional licensees of RentGrow Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners and property managers (again, collectively, as used in this Privacy Statement, “RentGrow Clients” or “Clients”). The other actors in the real estate economy are, of course, the residents, tenants and providers of various services for, or at, the buildings RentGrow Clients own and manage.  RentGrow Services (by means of example only, ScreeningWorks Pro, which is integrated into the web-based Voyager, fully integrated end-to-end software platform product suite) help Clients manage their real estate and other assets by, among other things, evaluating the qualification of tenant-applicants and the continuing qualification of tenants based on the criteria established solely by the Client for each of the properties it owns or managers. RentGrow generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom our Clients’ Client Data may pertain; RentGrow merely hosts or processes such data on behalf of our Clients. Any uses of Client Data by RentGrow are done so pursuant to the services agreement in place between RentGrow and the relevant RentGrow Client, or RentGrow’s applicable Terms of Service, which exclusively govern RentGrow’s treatment of Client Data. This Privacy Statement does not apply to RentGrow Services or Client Data.
If you have any questions about the data practices of a RentGrow Client that uses RentGrow Services to process your personal information, please contact the RentGrow Client directly.
Web Sites Not Covered
Some Services enable RentGrow Clients to create websites and applications of their own that run on the RentGrow platform. The terms of service and privacy notice of the RentGrow Client govern such websites.  If you submitted personal information to a RentGrow Client-controlled website or application (e.g. property branded RENTCafé resident portals) and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with the RentGrow Client directly.
The RentGrow Sites may contain links to other third-party websites. The information practices or content of such other websites is governed by the privacy statements or notices of such other websites. RentGrow encourages you to review the privacy statements or notices of such other websites to understand their information practices.
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
Some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), impose certain responsibilities on data controllers and data processors. A company is a data controller when it has the responsibility of determining why and how personal information is processed, whereas a company is a data processor when it processes personal information on behalf of a data controller. RentGrow is a data processor and not a data controller under GDPR with respect to Client Data. RentGrow Clients are data controllers because they make all decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or not, is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties. If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted or entered into a RentGrow Service by or on behalf of a RentGrow Client, or was otherwise collected by a RentGrow Service on behalf of a RentGrow Client, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the RentGrow Client directly. If an authorized RentGrow Client requests that we update or remove the data in question and the RentGrow Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.
California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”)
If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights with respect to personal information, as set forth in Cal. Civ. Code 1798.100 et seq.  This “Rights of Individuals” section of this Privacy Statement addresses those California-specific rights as applied to the CCPA-covered information, including the right to request information about the personal information we collect and share and to request access to and deletion of such information consistent with the provisions of the law.  Please note that most of the personal information RentGrow collects and maintains RentGrow maintains on behalf of RentGrow clients, as a service provider to those RentGrow clients.  As a result, RentGrow clients’ privacy policies, not this Privacy Statement, cover that information.  As a result, if you make a request to us with respect to such data, we will refer you to the RentGrow client (for instance, property management companies) on whose behalf we may maintain the information to assist you with your request.
Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”)
To the extent it is applicable, this Privacy Statement is made under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. There are some rare exceptions to the commitments set out in this Privacy Statement.
For more general inquiries, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Canada oversees the administration of the privacy legislation in the private sector. The Commissioner also acts as a kind of ombudsman for privacy disputes. The Information and Privacy Commissioner can be reached at:

However, some of the information voluntarily submitted that is not personal information, such as a response to a poll or a survey, is typically aggregated and thus not correctable, updatable, changeable, or erasable. For additional information or problems accessing your information from such page, contact us by using one of the methods listed in the Contacting Us section below. If you consider that we have processed your personal information in violation of applicable law and failed to remedy such violation to your reasonable satisfaction, you may also lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in your country.

How RentGrow Will Respond to a Request to Exercise Your Rights
For individual rights requests covered by the CCPA, RentGrow will provide a substantive response to your request generally within 45 days from when we receive it, although it may take longer under certain circumstances.  For individual rights requests covered by the GDPR, RentGrow will provide a substantive response to your request generally within 30 days from when we receive it, although it may take longer under certain circumstances.  For individual rights requests covered by other applicable laws, RentGrow will provide a substantive response within the timeframe set forth in such law.  In some cases, the law may allow us to refuse to act on certain requests.  When this is the case, we will endeavour to provide you with an explanation as to why.
We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity for purposes of responding to a request you have made.  If RentGrow is unable to verify your identity with the degree of certainty required, we will not be able to respond to the request.
You may designate an agent to submit requests on your behalf.  For requests covered by the CCPA, the agent can be a natural person or a business entity that is registered with the California Secretary of State.   If you would like to designate an agent to act on your behalf, you and the agent will need to comply with our agent verification process.
Please note that this subsection does not apply when an agent is authorized to act on your behalf pursuant to a valid power of attorney.  Any such requests will be processed in accordance with the applicable law pertaining to powers of attorney.
