Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise chartered by the United States Congress to provide a continuous flow of funds for residential mortgages in the U.S. We achieve our public purpose by purchasing, securitizing, and investing in home mortgages in the U.S., in effect acting as a conduit between the U.S. residential mortgage market and the investment community. We may receive personal information about you in the ordinary course of carrying out our business. We are committed to protecting the privacy of this information.
This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes the types of personally identifiable information we receive and maintain in the ordinary course of business and what we do with that information. This Policy also describes how we safeguard that information. Freddie Mac may provide links to third-party websites that have different privacy and security practices. This Policy does not apply to information that may be collected by or that you may provide to third parties through websites that link to or from this or our other websites. If you are a California resident, please visit California Privacy for our notice pursuant to The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which supplements this Policy.
None of our websites are directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information.
By your use of this website, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Policy.
Personally Identifiable Information We Receive and Maintain in the Ordinary Course of Our Business
As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means financial and other personal information about an individual. "Personally identifiable information" includes, but is not limited to, income information, debt payment histories, social security numbers, credit reports, and other information provided by consumer reporting agencies, mortgage lenders, dealers and other participants in the secondary mortgage market. "Personally identifiable information" does not include information that has been "de-identified" so that it no longer can reasonably be identified with a particular individual.
Circumstances under which we receive personally identifiable information include the following:
We receive personally identifiable information about borrowers, loan applicants and other individuals in the ordinary course of our secondary market business. We receive this information in several circumstances, including when evaluating whether to purchase a loan, when consummating the purchase of a loan, when reviewing information about loans in which we already have an interest for quality control and other purposes, and when evaluating, engaging in or otherwise dealing with various debt and securities-related transactions.
We receive personally identifiable information from brokers and third-party originator employees, principals and directors who register for our proprietary services, such as MyOptigo®, Loan Product Advisor® and the Loan Advisor Suite®, and from individuals seeking information from the Home Steps® program.
We receive personally identifiable information from individuals employed by or interested in pursuing employment with Freddie Mac.
We receive personally identifiable information from individuals and entities seeking to do business with Freddie Mac.
We receive personally identifiable information, sometimes including fingerprints ("Biometric Identifiers"), from employees, consultants and other individuals who work for or with Freddie Mac or require access to our offices, buildings and other facilities.
We receive personally identifiable information from borrowers and other individuals who contact us and provide us with information by telephone (for example, through our 1-800-FREDDIE service), through this and our other websites and from voluntary surveys offered on this or other websites.
Information We Collect Through This and our Other Websites
When you visit this website or our other websites, we collect and store the following information (collectively, "Website Visitor Information"): the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, such as aol.com; the Internet protocol address of the host server you are using, such as ww3.aol.com; the name and version of your Web browser, such as Internet Explorer; the date and time you access this website; and if you came to us through a link from some other website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked to us.
Cookies: Some parts of this or our other websites may use a "cookie," which is a small file that is placed on your computer or other internet-connected device. The cookie captures your internet protocol address, but no other personally identifiable information. The website may use a cookie in order to log which pages you visit on the website or to provide certain features during your visit to the website. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies; however, some features of the website may not function properly if you do this.
Third-Party Analytics: We use third-party web analytics services to evaluate use of this and our other websites and to improve functionality. These services may use cookies, web server logs and web beacons to provide us with analysis of how visitors access and use the websites.
Calculators: If you enter information into a financing or affordability calculator offered on this website (such as income, the down payment you want to make, the length of a loan you want or the price of a home you have in mind), that information is not seen or received by Freddie Mac. Your computer performs the calculator's functions and the results are displayed in your browser.
Do Not Track: We track the activity of visitors to our websites, but we do not track them when they cross to third-party websites. We do not use tracking to provide targeted advertising, and therefore our websites do not respond to Do Not Track signals sent by your browser.
What We Do With Personally Identifiable Information
We comply with applicable laws and regulations in our use and disclosure of personally identifiable information.
We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information to consumer marketing companies.
We use and disclose personally identifiable information in connection with our secondary market-related activities. For example, we use personally identifiable information to evaluate loans in which we are considering acquiring an interest or guaranteeing and to monitor the performance of loans that we own or guarantee. As another example, we use this information to evaluate the value of properties collateralizing these loans and predict default. We also disclose personally identifiable information to consumer credit counseling services.
We provide personally identifiable information to third parties as a necessary part of our secondary market-related activities and other aspects of our business, including to loan servicers, consumer reporting agencies, workout companies, attorneys, and technology providers who enable us or third parties to perform business, professional, and technical support functions for us or you. For example, we may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties to administer or protect our interest in a loan.
We use personally identifiable information for purposes of research and modeling related to our business, our public purpose, and our websites. We may publish the results of our research, but we will not publish personally identifiable information about you in connection with the research or otherwise.
We use personally identifiable information to establish and manage relationships with brokers, third-party originators, and other entities with whom we engage in business, such as information about these entities’ direct principals, officers and guarantors. We also may receive name, email addresses, phone numbers, photographs/images and other contact information for the employees of these entities with whom we are dealing.
We may disclose personally identifiable information related to your use of this or our other websites to third parties who assist us with this or our other websites. This may include information you provide as part of voluntary surveys about website-related issues taken after visiting this site.
We disclose personally identifiable information to our regulators, our conservator, and as otherwise required by applicable laws, regulations and court orders.
We may disclose personally identifiable information about individuals who apply for employment with Freddie Mac in connection with their employment application, their employment with Freddie Mac (if applicable), and our employment processes more generally.
If you work for or with Freddie Mac, we use personally identifiable information (sometimes including Biometric Identifiers) in connection with the security and access control systems for our offices, buildings and other facilities.
If you send us an email or message and provide your name or other personally identifiable information, we may use this information to research your question, to send an answer to your question and to deliver the requested information or service to you. We also may use this information to provide you with information in which we believe you will be interested; however, at any time, you may request that we stop doing this by contacting us in the manner described in the "How to Reach Us" section of this Policy.
We use Website Visitor Information for general statistical modeling, to measure the number of visitors to different pages on the website, and to evaluate, modify and enhance our websites and our business as we consider appropriate. We also use this information to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized access or unusual activity on the website. We may also use Website Visitor Information to help improve our services and visitors' overall experience.
How We Safeguard Personally Identifiable Information
We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that we receive, including computer files and documents that contain the information. Our standards are designed to:
Protect the security and confidentiality of the information;
Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information; and
Protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to an individual, such as a borrower, consumer, or employee.
We restrict access to personally identifiable information to those who need to know the information for our business purposes. We follow a corporate records retention program that requires us to destroy information we no longer need for our business or reasonable archival purposes. We destroy, erase, or make unreadable such information prior to disposal as required by applicable law. Our policies and our agreements with third parties require appropriate security and confidentiality standards to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information (including Website Visitor Information) and prohibit its unlawful disclosure.
We strive to maintain a high standard of security and privacy. However, no information can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and we make no such warranty or guarantee.
Special Statement Regarding the "Does Freddie Mac Own Your Mortgage?" Web Form and Self–Service Tool
In connection with the federal Making Home Affordable program, Freddie Mac provides a web form and related self-service tool on Freddiemac.com that enables individual borrowers and their agents to determine whether or not Freddie Mac owns their mortgage (the "Look-up Tool"). In order for Freddie Mac to be able to respond to those inquiries, individuals are asked to provide information that includes the last four digits of their Social Security Number, first name, last name, property-related information and contact information.
Freddie Mac uses and discloses the information collected via the Look-up Tool (excluding last four digits of the Social Security Number) only (i) to respond to the individual's inquiry, (ii) to provide services and fulfill Freddie Mac's obligations under the federal Making Home Affordable program and similar programs, and (iii) in connection with other loss mitigation activities. All information that you enter into the Look-up Tool is transmitted from the Look-up Tool to Freddie Mac via an encrypted communication channel.
We do not store, use or disclose the last four digits of your Social Security Number collected via the Look-up Tool for any purpose other than to respond to the inquiry.
Data Storage and Retention
Your personally identifiable information is stored by Freddie Mac on its servers or on servers of our third-party service providers. We retain personally identifiable information that we collect or receive for as long as we need to use it in connection with our business and may retain it thereafter as determined in accordance with our corporate records retention program and in compliance with applicable laws. We continue to treat all personally identifiable information that we retain in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations and this Policy. For additional information, please refer to our Biometric Information Privacy Policy.
Data Subject Rights under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), as well as the privacy laws of other countries, provide certain rights for natural persons who are considered data subjects under such regulation or laws ("data subjects"). This Policy is intended to provide data subjects with information about personal data (as defined in the GDPR, "personal data") that we collect and how that data is processed in compliance with GDPR and other countries’ laws. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information in the section below regarding How to Reach Us. In accordance with your rights as a data subject, you may request additional information about how we collect, use, share, store and retain your personal data. Among other rights as a data subject, you may obtain rectification of errors in the record of your personal data, or you may request erasure of your personal data, subject to our right to continue to process your personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party (for example, a loan agreement, guarantee, deed of trust, mortgage or other contract).
