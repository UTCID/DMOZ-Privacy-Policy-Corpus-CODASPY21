If you choose, you can visit the Site without providing us with any information about yourself.
We seek to limit the collection and use of customer information required to deliver service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.

•         Name
•         Address
•         Billing address
•         Shipping address
•         Email address

Personal Information Collected through the Security Camera or other Camera-Enabled Products
When you enable the recording features of your security camera or other camera-enabled products (for example, APN ’s video doorbell product), we will record, store, and process video and/or audio recordings from the device, depending on how you configure the camera and its settings. This may include capturing and making available to you portions of the recording data as part of a notification or analysis of the data to identify motion or other events. We process and store information from your camera-enabled product so that we can send you alerts when there is an event. If you have the recording features enabled, during the subscription period applicable to your camera-enabled product we will capture, process, and store video and audio recordings from your camera for at least 30 days from the date such data is first recorded and stored on our systems (“APN ‘s date of first capture”). During your subscription period, you will be able to access those recordings for up to 30 days from APN ‘s date of first capture of such data.
NOTE: Privacy laws in your state may impose certain obligations on you and your use of security camera or other camera-enabled products. You (not APN ) are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use such camera-enabled products. For example, you may be required to display a notice (even inside your home) that alerts visitors to your home that you are using a security camera or other camera-enabled products that are recording audio and video. Please also consider that recording and sharing of video that involves other people may affect their privacy rights.

For example, when you enroll or activate Third-Party Products and Services, you may be asked for your permission to share certain data between APN  and our partner. APN  requires your consent before sharing information in these circumstances. We may also receive information from our partners and other sources and combine that with the information in your APN  account to determine eligibility and efficacy of our programs.

Any data that APN  receives from third parties will be processed and stored by APN  and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your APN  account.

3. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
To Provide Products, Services, and Information
As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase from us, and to provide information that you request from us. This includes sending you alarm alerts and important service information about your alarm and our services. We use your personal information to contact you about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship our products to you. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us. You may opt out of receiving future communications (with the exception of alarm alerts and service information) from us by logging into your account and editing your profile.  You may also opt out of receiving commercial e-mail from us by following the instructions in each e-mail. To ensure reliability and improve your experience with our mobile app, we share information with Google Firebase to measure your in-app experience and improve its usability, speed, and reliability; only non-personally identifiable information is shared.
If you subscribe for monitoring services, or make other purchases through the Site, your credit card or debit card information (such as card type and expiration date) and other financial data that we need to process your payment may be collected and stored by the payment processors with which we work. We may also collect some limited information, such as your postal code, mobile number, and details of your transaction history, all of which are necessary to provide the monitoring services or products. In addition, the payment processors generally provide us with some limited information related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make additional purchases using the information they’ve stored, including recurring payments if you become a subscriber, and your card’s type, expiration date, and certain digits of your card number.
We use third parties to assist with providing our products and services to you (including our alarm monitoring services and dispatching emergency responders), host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to help us provide the service. We also employ strong security and technological controls and provisions to protect against unauthorized APN  employee access to the audio and video data collected from your security camera or other camera-enabled products.
Advertising
We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for APN  or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our Site or third-party sites not owned by APN .
We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. Our Site does not respond to “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative websites (www.aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org).

Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, we will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of APN  when we have your consent to do so.
Legal Proceedings
We will share personal information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of APN  if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
•         Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or governmental request.
•         Enforce applicable Terms of Sale and Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
•         Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
•         Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of APN , our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.
Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control
If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted or otherwise directed by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the terms of the applicable privacy policy in effect at the time of such transfer.
