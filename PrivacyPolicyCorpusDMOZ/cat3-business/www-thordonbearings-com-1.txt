Privacy
At Thordon, the privacy of your personal information has always been an important aspect of how we operate.  On January 1, 2004, the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) began to apply to provincially regulated organizations that collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activity.  As such, Thordon has developed the following Privacy Policy in order to ensure compliance with PIPEDA, as well as to inform individuals of our continuing commitment to the protection of their personal information. In May 2018, we reviewed this policy to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.
What is personal information?
Personal information includes any factual or subjective information, recorded or not, about an identifiable individual.  This includes information in any form such as a personal e-mail address, home addresses and so on.  It does not include information normally found on a business card, such as name, title, company, business address, business name, business e-mail address, business telephone or fax number.
Objective
Thordon collects and stores information on its employees and customers.  The policy and procedures below outline how this information is managed and used in order to protect the privacy of our employees and customers and to respect the Personal Information and electronic Documents Act and the General Data Protection Regulation.  The purpose of the act is to establish rules to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
Who is responsible for protecting the personal information collected, used and disclosed by Thordon?
The Human Resource Manager of Thomson-Gordon Group, parent company of Thordon Bearings Inc, is the Chief Privacy Officer for the organization.  The Chief Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring compliance with PIPEDA, the GDPR and with this Privacy Policy.   At times Thordon staff may be delegated to act on behalf of the Chief Privacy Officer or to take responsibility for occasional collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
