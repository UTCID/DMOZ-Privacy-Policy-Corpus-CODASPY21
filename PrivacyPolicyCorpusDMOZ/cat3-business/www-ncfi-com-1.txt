Collection and Use of Information
We will collect personally identifiable information you provide to us directly or through a web site, including but not limited to your name, job title, employer’s name, address, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail address. BMC may use and store such information to notify you of official business, provide a product or sample you requested, evaluate prospective customer needs and interests, and alert you of BMC news, activities, services and benefits. Personally identifiable information will be collected only for the purposes of completing a MSDS and/or sample request, or submitting information for a newsletter, white paper or other item. BMC reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics to measure interest in and use of the various areas of its Web site. The user may withdraw consent of BMC collection and maintenance of user information and to receipt of communications from us. The process to withdraw consent requires written notification to BMC at info@barnhardt.net. We will acknowledge the request then remove all data retained on the user.
The network of Web Sites (collectively, the “Barnhardt Manufacturing Company Web Sites”) operated by the Barnhardt Manufacturing Company (BMC) or its affiliates or subsidiaries (“Intrinsics”, “Richmond Dental”, “NCFI”, etc.), is comprised of various Web sites and Web pages.

Your use of the BMC Web Sites constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices. Your use of a particular BMC website included within the BMC Web Sites network may also be subject to additional terms outlined elsewhere on that website (the “Additional Terms”). Additionally, the BMC Web Sites may themselves contain additional terms that govern particular features or offers (for example, sweepstakes or chat areas). In the event that any of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein conflict with the Additional Terms or other terms and guidelines contained within any particular BMC website, then these terms shall control.

Third-Party Links
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, this Site may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third party vendors and other third parties (the “External Sites”). However, even if the third party is affiliated with BMC, BMC has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of BMC. BMC has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Links do not imply that BMC sponsors, endorses, is affiliated with or associated with, or has been legally authorized to use any trademark, trade name, service mark, design, logo, symbol or other copyrighted materials displayed on or accessible through such External Sites. Nonetheless, BMC seeks to protect the integrity of its Site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own Site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work). You should contact the Site administrator or Webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or the content located on such External Sites.
