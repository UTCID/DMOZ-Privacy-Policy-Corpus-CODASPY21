Privacy Policy and General Information
Pan American Tool Corporation wants you to know that we do everything possible to make sure your information is protected and not used for any other purpose other than what it was given to us for. Below you will find a detailed description of our policies and procedures. Pan American Tool Corporation wants to make sure you feel safe while in our site and after you leave. If you have any questions or concerns please contact us at admin@panamericantool.com.
Pan American Tool Corporation needs to collect your name, address, e-mail address and your phone number in order to ship your order, verify your credit card and contact you if we have a problem. Pan American Tool Corporation will never sell your personal information to any third party for any reason what so ever. Pan American Tool Corporation protects your information while in our database with all of the most up to date firewall Internet security. If you are using a browser like Internet Explorer or Netscape it will transmit your data in an encrypted form, this makes it almost impossible for someone to capture your information.
Credit Card Information
Pan American Tool Corporation treats your credit card information with the highest level of security. We use a (SSL) Secure Socket Layer Technology. This is the most advanced form of security for credit card transactions over the Internet. The way this technology works is when you enter any sensitive information when it leaves your computer it gets mixed up. The information stays mixed up until it reaches our secure server. Once in our server it is put back in order by the same source that mixed it up and then used for its intended purpose. The data cannot be read while being transferred and the only source that can unscramble it is the source that scrambled it to start with, and that is located on our server. After your order is shipped and we have received payment from our merchant Pan American Tool Corporation destroys all credit card information. This means the total time your information is retained in our secure server is approximately 72 hours.
E-Mail Address
Pan American Tool Corporation understands that just because you purchase a product from us does not mean you want your e-mail box filled with a million messages from every site on the web. So here is our short and simple e-mail policy. Pan American Tool Corporation will never sell your e-mail address to any company for any reason. The only mail you will receive is from our site. The only way you will receive mail from us is if you choose the opt-in option on our shopping cart page, or in the event you make a purchase we send your invoice via e-mail.
Cookies
Pan American Tool Corporation uses cookies to help our website recognize you when you enter, we want to know you have been in our site so that you are able to have a better shopping experience. A cookie is nothing more than a small file that your computer stores on its hard drive. Once our cookie is stored each time you log into our site the site simply recognizes you and will make your browsing a little faster. These cookies are harmless and can only be recognized by the source that created it. If you want the cookies removed from your computer just refer to your systems help section. Search the phrase "remove cookies" it should guide you on how to remove the cookies from your system.
Security
Pan American Tool Corporation uses two types of security. The first type is called (SSL) Secure Socket Layer technology. This technology scrambles all your personal information once it leaves your computer and our server puts it back together once it arrives. During its travels it cannot be read. The second type of security we use is called (a FIREWALL). This type of software is widely used in today's market. It is simple the way it works. Our systems are always running and always talking to each other. When an outside source is trying to see our information this software simply denies access. It uses several other very detailed programs to scramble and block privileged information but in simple terms if they don't need the information chances are very good they are not going to get it.
