Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: risks related to foreign operations, especially in emerging regions, including currency exchange rate changes, the cost and availability of raw materials and energy, the effectiveness of its research and development and growth investments, acquisitions and divestitures of assets and gains and losses from dispositions, developments affecting Grace's funded and unfunded pension obligations, its legal and environmental proceedings, costs of compliance with environmental regulation and those additional factors set forth in Grace's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are readily available at www.sec.gov. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Grace's projections and forward-looking statements, which speak only as the date thereof. Grace undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revision to the projections and forward-looking statements contained on this website, or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of their publication here.
