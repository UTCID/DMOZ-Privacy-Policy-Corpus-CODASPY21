PRIVACY INFORMATION
Information We Collect
The Shopatron service collects information about the use of the service in order to provide a secure and personalized experience. For example, we collect customer name, purchasing records, and shopping patterns.
We may collect Information when you: (a) place an order via the Shopatron service; (b) send email messages or other information to us.
Like many other websites, Shopatron uses a standard technology called “cookies”. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive and not on our site. They can help make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow you to keep shopping cart information independent from our servers. Cookies help us understand how customers use the service, which allows us to improve and tailor the service. You will not be able to use the Shopatron service if you disable cookies.
Disclosure of Information
We do not sell, rent, or loan your information to third parties without your permission. So, for example, we do not sell your email address or other information to mass marketers. Members of the Shopatron network (manufacturers and merchant shippers) will be allowed to contact you with special offers and information related to products you have bought or shopped for on the Shopatron network.
Privacy Protection for Children
In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly provide our service to persons under the age of 18.
