About Anti Climb Guards
Vandgard: Providers of Anti Climb System (Devices) in United KingdomGood-looking, long lasting and inexpensive With crime and vandalism an ever-increasing threat, protecting your property from theft and serious damage is a priority for most people, whether on business premises or at home. And while it used to be sufficient to protect a potentially dangerous installation with a simple fence and warning signs, now if an intruder is injured or even killed on your property, then you are legally responsible and you could find yourself in real trouble. Many now find that one of the most powerful defences is Vandgard, an advanced anti-scaling security barrier for walls, gates and fences. Durable and easy to install, it provides an inexpensive, yet effective, solution to property protection. Vandgard's design is unique, consisting of a series of curved vanes, each revolving freely around a central shaft to create an unstable barrier which moves if anyone attempts to climb over it. Manufactured from a technically complex high tensile alloy, Vandgard is strong, durable and completely corrosion resistant. This corrosion resistance means that it has a very long life and is also particularly suitable for exposed areas and those vulnerable to pollution. In addition, its superior corrosion resistance means that the material stays bright and so maintains deterrent effect throughout its life. Because it is lightweight, weighing only 4 kilos per metre, it is also very easy to handle and can be used on even wooden or mesh fencing. Due to its ease and speed of installation, it also offers substantial cost benefits over traditional methods of protection, such as coils of barbed wire. Unlike broken glass or razor wire, which can form mantraps, or impaling rotating spikes which are often illegal and can also present a dangerous hazard to employees working overhead or nearby. Vandgard is inherently safe and so does not contravene either the Health or Safety at Work Act, COSHH regulations or any other civil or criminal laws. And because of its unique curved vanes, it cannot be either covered with a coat, or jammed firm with a doormat, methods often used to incapacitate other rotating barriers, so it maintains its effectiveness as an unassailable barrier to would-be thieves and vandals.
