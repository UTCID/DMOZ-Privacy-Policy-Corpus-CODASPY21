Century Management is also registered as a Portfolio Manager in the Province of Ontario.  A complete description of Century Management's fee schedule, investment strategies, and wealth management services can be found under Part 2 of its FORM-ADV. Additional information regarding policies for valuing portfolios and calculating performance is available upon request.Products and ServicesNothing contained in the Site is intended as, or constitutes, an offer to buy or sell or is in any way a solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities, investments or other property. Any decision to invest should not be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this Site.Please remember that the value of your investments and any income they produce may go down as well as up, and you may lose principal value. As part of the discretionary management arrangement in which separate account clients engage Century Management, investments in Century Management Strategies will have varying amounts of exposure to securities and cash or cash equivalent holdings. These investment and portfolio management decisions are at the sole discretion of Century Management. Therefore, depending on individual investments and overall market conditions, Century Management's Investment Strategies may not track movements in the overall stock and bond markets, particularly over the short term.  As a result, there may be times that client investment objectives will not be achieved. While the intent of Century Management's Investment Strategies may include one or more objectives, including, without limitation, long-term capital appreciation, total return, current income, or conservation of capital, the investment return and principal value of each Strategy may fluctuate or deviate from overall market returns to a greater degree than other investment products and services that do not employ these Strategies. For example, if an Investment Strategy has taken a defensive posture and the market advances, the return to investors will be lower than if the portfolio had not been defensive. Alternatively, if an Investment Strategy has taken an aggressive posture, a market decline will magnify the Strategy's investment losses.Century Management reserves the right to modify its current investment strategies and investment techniques based on changing market dynamics or client needs.Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future results. Many factors and risks, including, without limitation, investment risk, market risk, interest rate risk, management style risk, business and sector risk, small company risk, non-diversified strategy risk, foreign securities risk, bond interest rate risk, and credit risk may affect the value of your investments. Furthermore, levels and bases of taxation are subject to change and will depend on your personal circumstances. Moreover, specific risks may arise in relation to specific investments and you should review the risk factors very carefully before investing. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors on the tax implications of making an investment in securities, holding or disposing of securities, investments in other property, or distributions of income in these respective holdings.Market and Performance InformationAny market, price or performance data provided on this Site is for informational purposes only. Century Management believes that the information which may be viewed on this Site is accurate as of the date of publication, and where a particular page is dated the information on such page is believed to be accurate as of that date. However, although the information sources are deemed to be reliable, Century Management does not guarantee or make any warranty regarding the accuracy, suitability or completeness of such information, or any information available through any site to which you may link through this Site.Limitation of LiabilityCentury Management shall not be liable for any loss (direct or consequential) arising from the use of, or reliance on, any part of this Site, except for any liability it may have under applicable securities laws. Further, you should be aware that the Internet is not a completely reliable transmission medium. Century Management shall not accept liability for any losses, costs, or expenses arising from your inability to access the Site for any reason or any delay in, or failure of, the transmission or the receipt of any instructions or notifications sent through the Site.Anti-Money Laundering InformationThis policy addresses the Century Management's efforts to prevent money laundering.Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the unlawful proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages.Cash first enters the financial system at the "placement" stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions.At the "layering" stage, the funds are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money from its criminal origin.At the "integration" stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate businesses.Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal the origin or intended use of the funds, which will later be used for criminal purposes.Century Management does not accept cash from clients. It is Century Management's policy to decline to accept possession of clients' securities. If the firm were ever to inadvertently acquire a stock certificate from a client, Century Management would forward the certificate to the client's account custodian within three business days.Century Management will instruct a custodian to deduct cash or a cash equivalent from a client's account only in the following limited circumstances:To pay Century Management's investment advisory fees, as authorized in the written investment advisory agreement between Century Management and the client; orWhen the proceeds are directly transmitted to another account held in the client's name.Century Management will only accept clients whose accounts are maintained at brokerage firms subject to the USA Patriot Act.Information for Foreign InvestorsEach of the investment products (including all separate account investment strategies, as well as the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund) or services referred to in the Century Management website may be offered only to persons in the United States.

Mission critical information is the information considered necessary to keep the business running. Not all functions within the firm are considered mission critical, so a priority list has been established. The order of precedence for supplying optimal functionality and key business functions to Century Management are:Trading FunctionalityAccess to Research & AnalysisClient ServicesThe centerpiece of the Plan is the backup of the Firms technology infrastructure.  Adviser uses a Datto Backup appliance with cloud sync. The Datto Backup appliance is configured to create point-in-time replicas of all critical servers on local storage and in the Datto Cloud site. The replicas can be failed over individually or in groups. The validity of all replicas is tested after each point-in-time update by powering on and capturing a screen shot of the powered on replica. Since the cloud hosted DR site is online and accessible from the production LAN, replicas and backups are always available for recovery and testing.   All backup data is stored in the Datto Cloud infinitely, meaning Adviser can fail back to any point in time since Datto Backup was installed in December 2019.In the event of a power outage or power surges that may affect all on-site electronic equipment, power will be maintained by an on-site battery backup system that will provide an uninterruptible power supply for a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes. This will allow sufficient time for the Advisers diesel generator to begin operation (typically it takes three seconds for the generator to power-up). Once operational, the generator will provide an uninterrupted and continuous power supply for an estimated range of three to five days.Tax InformationInternal Revenue Service Circular 230 NoticeCentury Management and its associates DO NOT provide legal or tax advice.
