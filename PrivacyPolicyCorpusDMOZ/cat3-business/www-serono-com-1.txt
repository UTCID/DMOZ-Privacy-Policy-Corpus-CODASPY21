Who We Are
Healthcare
The work of our Healthcare business can help to make a difference to millions of lives. We put our patients at the center of everything we do.

Our Healthcare business aims to change lives
With a holistic approach, we design and develop medicines and intelligent devices that strive to provide ongoing care for patients beyond their treatment. This includes medications to treat conditions such as cancer or multiple sclerosis (MS). For example, we offer an injection device and disease monitoring software outside USA and Canada that allow patients with MS to self-inject their medicine and track its administration. With cancer, we are researching the use of biomarkers that can match potential treatment to individual patients.
Our goal is to support people at various stages of life. We have helped many women and couples achieve their dream of having a baby. As a global market leader in fertility treatments, we do what we do with passion – and we think further ahead. That’s why we complemented our legacy in fertility drug treatments with the launch of a dedicated Fertility Technologies unit to help improve treatment outcomes in the lab.
See all therapeutic areas of our business below:
