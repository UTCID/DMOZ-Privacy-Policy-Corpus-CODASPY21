"I implore you — please take action before leaving town for the elections," he testified. "If Congress adjourns without extending the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) or providing other enhanced relief, more restaurants will close, more employees will lose their jobs and the pandemic economic crisis will deepen."Rodrigue said restaurants have suffered more losses in dollars and jobs than any other industry."What restaurants and their employees need is targeted help for the nation's second-largest private-sector employer," he said.Rodrigue reiterated the Association's call for Congress to consider short-term assistance like the authorization of a second round of the PPP, with greater flexibility for both operating expenses and payroll outlays. Additionally, he encouraged the Subcommittee to consider long-term tools from the Association's Blueprint for Restaurant Revival, including:Passing the Senate version of the RESTAURANTS Act, which takes a balanced approach to support independent and locally owned franchise restaurants.Ensuring that business expenses paid from PPP proceeds are tax-deductible.Enacting a refundable tax credit to cover investments in equipment and safety programs and to set up social distancing in facilities amid a crippling economic climate.Enhancing the Employee Retention Tax Credit."Restaurants and our employees have a personal connection with customers. In some towns, it's a small chain; in some towns, it's a beloved local restaurant. But every one of you, and every American, has a place that is their favorite. Regardless of the name on the door, restaurants are community cornerstones that provide a ladder of opportunity for employees," Rodrigue said.OperationsKeep up with what's happening in the restaurant industrySubscribe now to the Restaurant Operator Daily, which brings you the top stories from Fast Casual, Pizza Marketplace, and QSR Web.SUBSCRIBE NOWPrivacy PolicyOperationsYour Pie, InMoment partner to elevate customer experienceNRA to Congress: 'Restaurants in economic free fall'Squisito Pizza and Pasta names managing partnerGeneralJolt - Maintaining Brand Standard Consistency During ExpansionView More On OperationsTOP STORIESDecember starts on down-note for Domino's, Papa John's, Pizza Hut4 ways companies can build pandemic-era franchisee musclePizza brands give thanks for '2015-era' gas prices, higher stock valuesRestaurant Franchising & Innovation SummitMay 4-6, 2021 | AtlantaRFIS 2020 Sponsor Preview: AttentiveRFIS 2020 Sponsor Preview: Partners & NapierRFIS 2020 Sponsor Preview: ADM MarketingOverviewAgendaSpeakersSponsorsVenueRegisterNewsYour Pie, InMoment partner to elevate customer experienceQSR transaction numbers help temper November US restaurant sales declinesFlorida's largest food hall opening in springMici launches uncooked lasagana to goRezku adopts Epson's TM-m3011 POS receipt printerTake-and-bake pizza brand acquisition creates private label pizza companyPizza Hut stacks pie, bread, dessert in one packMore NewsResourcesWelcoming Generation COVID back to restaurantsCosta Vida + SynergySuite Case StudyChanging Customer Behaviors: From Customer to FamilyIs Your Restaurant Technology Ready for 2021?The Evolution of Ghost KitchensMore ResourcesTrendingPrivate-equity firm invests in Papa John's biggest franchiseeTake-and-bake pizza brand acquisition creates private label pizza companyPizza Hut stacks pie, bread, dessert in one packFlorida's largest food hall opening in springStoner's Pizza doubles-down in Ft Lauderdale, FloridaPremium ContentFood Truck Operator E-learning Series [$249]2020 Fast Casual State of the Industry [$499.99]2020 Digital Signage Hardware Comparison Guide [$499.00]2020 Mobile Payment & Loyalty App Guide [$299.00$199.00]2019 Fast Casual State of the Industry [$497.00]Strategic PartnersAbout Us | Contact Us | Advertise | Editorial Policy | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Service | Site Map | RssUse of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms Of Service and Privacy Policy.
