2. Information about the personal information we process and how long we keep it for
Data protection law sets out a number of conditions which organisations can rely on in order to lawfully handle personal information. The conditions we rely on are as follows:
Performance of a contract
Depending on the nature of your request some information may be mandatory. Where possible we will mark these details with an *. This is the case where the handling of your personal information is necessary to enable us to perform our contractual obligations to you. If you don’t provide this information we cannot fulfil your request or perform our part of the contract.
Your contract with Vauxhall may include support or cover for a specified period of time. In these situations Vauxhall or their appointed service provider will endeavour to advise you of the expiry date prior to your cover ending so that you can consider extending your cover if you desire.
Legitimate interests
The law permits Vauxhall to handle your personal information where necessary in our legitimate interests, provided that this isn’t outweighed by your interests. Many of the purposes where we handle your personal information, described below, fall into this category as they are essential activities which enable us to run our business efficiently and effectively. We may, if necessary, also use your personal information to defend legal rights or to obtain legal advice and to manage any complaint that you might have. We ensure that your rights and interests are protected when we do this.
Consent
Vauxhall use your personal information when you consent for us to do so (e.g for direct marketing purposes). If you choose to provide special category data such as information about trade union membership to prove eligibility for Partners Programmes for example, you allow us to use this.
Where we rely on consent as the lawful basis for processing your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the date on which it was withdrawn.
Required by law
Vauxhall will, if required by law, disclose your personal information in response to a court order. We will disclose your personal information if requested by a law enforcement agency or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, non-compliance with Vauxhall Terms or otherwise as permitted or required by law and consistent with legal requirements.
