A: Bill Payer registration is easy. The first time you attempt to access the bill payment section of Online Banking, you will be prompted to begin online registration. You are first requested to read and accept the authorization disclosure. Failure to accept the disclosure terms prevents the registration process from proceeding.
Once the disclosure is agreed to, you complete the online registration form. The registration form is then forwarded us for review. We are responsible for checking the information on the form. The registration information is then transmitted to our Bill Payer partner for their approval process. After the application is approved by everyone, you will receive an activation email within 10 days from the date that you submitted your application. Bill Payer does not require any separate PIN numbers or login information.

Q: Who can be paid using Bill Payer?

You can pay practically anyone- charge accounts, utilities, auto loans, professionals, even a lawn service or a relative. However, tax payments (such as federal, state and local) and court directed payments (such as alimony and child support) cannot be processed through Bill Payer.
Q: Can I pay my bills on the weekend?
A: You can set up your payments during the weekend. However, the system will prohibit you from scheduling a single payment and the first of a recurring payment on the same weekend. This is because payments scheduled for the weekend are always processed on the Friday before. Therefore, when scheduling payments on a weekend, the first day for which you can schedule payments (single or recurring) is the first business day following the weekend.
Generally, single or recurring payments that fall on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal Holiday are processed on the previous business day and are debited from your account within two business days. If a Federal Holiday falls on either a Friday or Monday, the debit will occur within three days.
Q: If I schedule multiple payments for a single day, how will my account be debited- as a lump sum or separately?
A: Each payment is debited separately.
Q: What if I do not have sufficient funds on the day you debit my account?
A: Following is a summary of Metavante’s, our Bill Payer provider’s, Insufficient Funds procedure: A block will automatically be placed on all accounts that have an ACH debit returned to bill payment services. No additional bill payments will be processed until the account is properly funded and the return(s) cleared. If a payment request is received while the account is blocked, a letter will be sent notifying you that the payment(s) will not be processed. A copy will also be sent to Edwards FCU.
Upon the first return, Metavante will automatically re-send all ACH returns under $100.00. Exception: debits for payments in which the credit portion was sent electronically will be resent regardless of the dollar amount without verification from us.
Metavante will contact us to verify all returns exceeding $100.00. If funds are available, they will re-send the return(s). If funds are unavailable and if the payment was made by check, a stop payment will be placed.
Q: Are all debits and credits sent out at the same time?
A: Yes, they are all sent out at the same time.
Q: How is my account debited?
A: Your account is debited via ACH.
Q: What is ACH?
A: Automated Clearing House is a funds transfer system which provides for the clearing of electronic entries for participating financial institutions.
Q: If I make an error in selecting an electronic payee and it results in a late fee, am I responsible for the charges?
A: If you select an electronic payee with an address that is different from that indicated on the payment coupon, then you are responsible for the late fee. You always have the option to manually enter a different address for a payee.
If you select an electronic payee with the address that matches that indicated on the payment coupon, and Metavante routes the payment incorrectly, then Metavante will take responsibility for the late fee.
Q: How do I place a ‘stop payment’ on a bill payment?
A: A payment may be edited or deleted anytime before the “process date.” Payments that have been remitted electronically cannot be stopped.
Courtesy Pay FAQs
Q: What is Courtesy Pay?
A: Courtesy Pay is a discretionary service provided to eligible accounts. It’s designed to help prevent your insufficient funds items from being returned or declined. With Courtesy Pay, Edwards FCU may provide you a specific Courtesy Pay limit depending on the type of account you have.
Q: What’s the difference between Courtesy Pay and other Overdraft Protection Programs?
A: Other overdraft protection programs such as a link to a savings account may be preferable but are limited as to how many times a transfer may be made to cover an overdraft. Also, other overdraft protection programs require that funds be available. With Courtesy Pay items that would otherwise be declined or returned are paid and the debit is posted to your account. In the event your account is accidentally overdrawn, Courtesy Pay is a useful addition if there are no other funds available at the time of overdraft.
Q: Am I eligible for Courtesy Pay?
A: You are eligible for courtesy pay if you:
Have a minimum of $1 in your savings account
Have a checking account that has been open for a minimum of 60 days
Are not delinquent on any of your Edwards FCU loans (if applicable)
Enrollment in the program for Checks and ACH items are automatic when you meet the above conditions. Edwards FCU may automatically pay items that would otherwise be returned due to insufficient funds by overdrawing your Share Draft (Checking) account not to exceed your courtesy pay limit. If you do not wish to participate in this program, you may contact us to “Opt-out” of this service.
Q: What type of overdrafts does Courtesy Pay Cover?
A: Initially Courtesy Pay will only cover Checks and ACH debits, but with your consent Courtesy Pay may also cover ATM withdrawals and everyday debit card purchases. You may at your request Opt-In to the payment of ATM and everyday debit card purchases. You may also rescind your consent at any time. Furthermore, you may Opt-out of courtesy pay in its entirety. (Please keep in mind that ‘opting-out’ may result in Checks and ACH items being returned as NSF and your account will be charged a $29.00 NSF fee.)
Q: What is my Courtesy Pay Limit?
A: For eligible members, your courtesy pay limit on you Share Draft (Checking) account will be either $500 or $750 (inclusive of fees). The default courtesy pay limit for share draft accounts is $500. For members with a direct deposit of at least $500 per month, your courtesy pay limit will be increased to $750 so long as your direct deposit is reoccurring. Business Members are eligible for a Courtesy Pay limit of $750.
Q: How much does Courtesy Pay cost?
A: For each overdraft that is posted to your account a $29.00 Courtesy Pay charge will be assessed to your account. Although overdrafts are discouraged, Courtesy Pay allows you to avoid excessive fees that a merchant may charge for returned items.
Q: How long do I have to bring my account positive?
A: Once your account is overdrawn you will have a full 30 days to bring your account current. However, if the account remains overdrawn after 30 days your courtesy pay privileges will be suspended and a $15 collection fee may be assessed. All accounts must be paid current no later than 45 days unless arrangements have been made prior to 31 days overdrawn.
Q: How will I know when I have used Courtesy Pay?
A: You will be notified by mail the first time your Courtesy Pay is used. Other notices will also be sent to you when your account has been overdrawn for 5, 15, and 30 days (excluding weekends and holidays).
Visa® Check Card FAQs
Q: I pushed the Credit button at the store and the amount of the purchase still came out of my checking account. Why didn’t I get a Visa credit card bill for it?
A: All purchases made with your Visa Check Card will always be withdrawn from your Checking account. Your Visa CheckingCard or a Visa Platinum Credit Card are charged to a Visa Credit Card account. To get a Visa Credit Card account, you must apply with a signed loan application. Loan applications can be obtained online at www.edwardsfcu.org, through CALL-24 at (661) 952-5945 or toll free (877) 256-330 or by visiting a branch. If your credit history qualifies, you will be awarded a Visa Platinum card depending on your credit worthiness.
Q: What is the difference between “Credit” and “Debit”?
A: A Credit transaction may also be called signature-based, because that is what you do, put your signature on the receipt. To get to this feature in some retail stores, you may need to slide your card and then hit the Cancel button in order to choose the Credit button. Cash-back is not available through a Credit transaction. Any charge made with this option could take up to three days to post to your checking account.
A Debit transaction may also be called PIN-based, because that’s what you do, put your PIN (Personal Identification Number) into the keypad. This is the feature that will automatically appear at most retail stores. If you are requiring cash-back, this is the option that you would select. Charges made with this option will post to your checking account instantly. Some merchants may charge an additional fee to make a Debit transaction.
Q: I received this card in the mail, but didn’t ask for another Visa card.
A: All members with checking accounts will receive this card. This is not a Visa credit card; it is a Visa Check Card. The Visa Check Card allows you to perform transactions at ATM locations and at participating merchants. With this card, you can withdraw cash from your Edwards FCU accounts with no surcharge through any ATM that displays the Co-op logo. Additionally, you can use your Visa Check Card to make purchases at merchants that display the following logos:
