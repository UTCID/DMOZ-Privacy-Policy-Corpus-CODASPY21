LEO A DALY seeks to maintain a vibrant community full of followers with a variety and diversity of perspectives. We encourage and welcome your comments and active participation.
To create a community that is lively and welcoming, we ask our social media community to abide by the following guidelines:
Respect. Please refrain from engaging in personal attacks, posting inflammatory language or antagonizing other community participants. Hateful or discriminatory comments regarding race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation or political beliefs will not be tolerated.
Responsibility. Content that you post on any of LEO A DALY’s social media sites is your own. Even when promoting issues and positions that are in line with the work of the organization, your online content and comments do not constitute work or action on behalf of LEO A DALY. We strive to maintain a safe and sensible place to have discussions, but we are not responsible in any way for the content of the posts, or any personal actions you may take because of the posts. We do, however, reserve the right to reject or remove posts that violate our social media community guidelines, at our sole discretion and without prior notice.
Focus. Conversations can stray, sometimes to interesting and stimulating places, but we ask that you stay on topic. Off topic posts may become issues for future discussions, but in the meantime, may be moved or deleted without notice if we believe they are interfering with the current discussion.
Prohibited. Social media participants may not post messages that are threatening, violent, offensive, abusive, harassing, intimidating, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, indecent, illegal or unlawful. Spam is not allowed; we define spam as posting the same message over and over or posts related to commercial promotion. Trolls are not allowed; we define troll as someone who creates conflict on social media by posting messages that are particularly controversial or inflammatory with the intent of provoking an emotional (often negative) response from other users.
LEO A DALY reserves the right to report unlawful behavior, conduct and vandalism of our social media communities to specific social media platforms, to Internet service provider(s) or to law enforcement. In addition, we retain sole discretion to reject posts, delete existing posts or block users from further participation at any time and without prior notice.
