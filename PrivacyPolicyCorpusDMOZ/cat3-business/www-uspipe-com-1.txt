Governing Law
This Agreement and all matters relating to the Site and the Terms of Use and any disputes or claims arising therefrom or related thereto, shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Texas, United States applicable to agreements made and to be performed in the State of Texas, United States without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require application of the substantive law of any other jurisdiction. You agree that any legal action or proceeding between U.S. Pipe and you for any purpose concerning this Agreement or the parties' obligations hereunder shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the County of Dallas, State of Texas, United States and you hereby expressly and irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of these courts. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the use of this Site and supersedes any prior written or oral agreement or understandings between the parties with respect to this Site. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.
Miscellaneous
U.S. Pipe's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. U.S. Pipe may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.
Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
