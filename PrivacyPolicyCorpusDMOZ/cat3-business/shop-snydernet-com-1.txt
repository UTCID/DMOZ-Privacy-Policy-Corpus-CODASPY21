PRIVACY POLICY
Snyder Industries, Inc. (“Snyder") respects your privacy, and we assure you that we take the protection of your personal information very seriously. We therefor provide this Privacy Policy to disclose our information collection, utilization, and sharing practices for this Site. This Privacy Policy applies to any website or mobile application that includes, attaches, references, or links to this Privacy Policy (the “Site”). Unless explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Snyder does not own or control or to people that Snyder does not employ or manage. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access the Snyder Site or other related services. The information we receive from you depends on what you do when you visit this Site. Except as described in this policy, we do not sell, rent, share or disclose your personally identifiable information to or with any other organizations.
TYPE AND USES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU:
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) - Generally, you can visit our Site without revealing any personal information about yourself. At times, though, we may need information about you. Unless otherwise indicated, the information we request is optional. We may gather certain personal information from you to help us better serve you through e-commerce transactions and promotions, as well as to respond to inquiries and information and opportunities. We only collect personally identifiable information when you choose to reveal it to us. In New Jersey, the Site is intended for use by commercial entities, not individual consumers. No individual consumers for which New Jersey Law applies are authorized to use the Site, and therefore no PII or other information regarding such consumers is intentionally collected by Snyder. Consequently, you should only be providing PII to us as is necessary and as it relates to your interactions with the Site as an authorized individual consumer or as someone who is the agent of the commercial entity that you represent.
Our Site collects information from our web forms that may be displayed on our Site. At these places, we may ask you to give us contact information (like name, company name, title, and company email address, phone number, and address, along with answers to questions topical to the web form and an ability to state additional information).
When you email a question to one of our team members, we receive your email address and any other information you choose to include in your email. If you use other web forms to submit inquiries or sign up for mailing lists or other information, we will collect the information you submit. If we receive similar questions from other users, we may post the most frequently asked questions on our site under a “FAQ” section. The question we post may be similar to, or the same as, the question you submitted, but we will not identify you (or anyone else) as the questioner.
The primary purpose of many web forms is to allow you to request and purchase information, products, and services from us. Our Site collects information when you make purchases, such as your name, and company name, e-mail, phone number, physical address, and purchase history. We use the information you provide to process your purchases and otherwise provide the product and services you request, as well as support for those products and services. We and our Affiliates may use your PII to send you information and advertising about our companies and their products and services including without limitation to provide you with products and services you have expressed interest in, requested, and/or purchased. We also reserve the right, but not the obligation, to contact you regarding changes to this Privacy Policy and other matters relevant to the Site.
INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED:
When you visit our Site, we may collect some information automatically. By collecting this information we get a better understanding of your needs and what products and services we can develop to meet those needs. Some of the information we automatically collect is necessary for the proper functioning of the Site, such as cookies as explained below. All the information we gather helps us understand your preferences and how well our Site is functioning so we can continually improve your online experience with us.
Links, Embedded Content, and Buttons - We may keep track of how you interact with links across our services, including our email notifications. We do this to help improve our services, provide information and advertising, and to be able to analyze aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. This Site may contain links to other websites, content embedded in our Site that comes from or relates to other websites and services, and buttons from other websites and services such as social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and these third parties may use cookies or other tracking devices to collect and track information about you across the Internet. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites or their data collection practices. You should check the privacy policies of these other websites when providing personally identifiable information or to find out what other information they collect from users, whether while on their platform or website or in relation to links, buttons, or embedded media on the Site or elsewhere.

Some of this information may be collected using cookies, as further explained below. This information is used for a variety of purposes to improve our Site and its content, including without limitation to gather broad demographic data, identify trends and statistics, help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site and its content. We may also collect and share information between pages of our Site for the proper functioning of our Site, as well as authentication. We may also use this information to provide you with information and advertising regarding our products and services.
Cookies - Our Site may use "cookies" to provide information on your computer. Cookies are pieces of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your device. We may use both session and persistent cookies on our own or through our third party service providers as described below. Cookies may save your preferences while you are at our Site, such as allowing for persistent login on pages that require logging in, and we may use them to provide you with tailored information and tracking as you use our Site. Cookies help us, among other things, to determine which areas of our Site are popular by tracking hits to those areas, which may in turn allow us or our third party providers to provide you with targeted information or advertising regarding our products and services. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject cookies. The rejection or limitation of cookies by your browser may limit your ability to use the Site. We also use third party cookies (such as DoubleClick) to run Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These cookies gather website visitor data (such as age, gender, and interests) to optimize website content and marketing and do not collect any personally identifiable information.
Third-Party Service Providers - We may use a variety of third-party services to help provide our services, to help us understand the use of our services, provide information and provide advertising regarding our Site and our products and services. Third party services providers may include, but are not limited to Google Analytics, SnapEngage for live chat, Sage Payment Solutions to process payments, and a variety of third party social media platforms used such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Web Beacons - We may employ Web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs), which are customized links or similar technologies, on the Site and when sending you messages, newsletters, or promotional emails or in using third party service providers. Web beacons allow us to (a) determine whether you have opened, or acted upon, a promotional email and which links you have clicked on in order to deliver to you more focused communications and other content, (b) allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain webpages and effectively deliver services, and (c) enable us to compile aggregated statistics and determine the efficacy of promotions by using Web beacons from third parties.
Combining of Information - We may combine information we collect from or about you from the Site with information from various sources including without limitation information provided at trade shows, during phone calls, live chat, or public information we obtain about you to identify you and to provide you with products and services, information, and advertising.
SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION
We will not sell, rent or lease your information to others without your consent, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. In general, the information you provide will be used to support your customer relationship with us and to enhance and improve our Site, products, services, and advertising.
We may engage third party service providers, consultants, and independent contractors to perform functions and provide services for us including without limitation those third party service providers mentioned in this Privacy Policy. We may share the information we collect through our Site with these service providers so that they can perform services for us in relation to the Site and our business. For example, we may share your information with our advertising and email vendors so that they can provide services to us such as emailing you about our products and services.

We may disclose visitor information when subpoenaed, for government investigations, and when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.
