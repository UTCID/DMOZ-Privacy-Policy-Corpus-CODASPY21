Anti-Spam Policy
What is Spam?
Spam is unsolicited e-mail, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or newsgroups. In short, spam is “junk e-mail.”
As defined by H.R. 3113 and reported by the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, unsolicited e-mail refers to any electronic message that:
advertises a product or service for profit,
is sent for other commercial purposes,
is sent to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business relationship, or
invites the recipient to view content on an internet website that is operated for a commercial purpose.
Managed Account Research Incorporated (MARI) recognizes an e-mail as “spam” if:
the recipient is unable to easily unsubscribe from the e-mail list,
the transmission contains invalid or forged headers, invalid or non-existent domain names, or other means of deceptive addressing, or
in the opinion of the recipient, the transmission and reception of the message appears to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.
What is opt-in vs. opt-out e-mail?
Opt-in e-mail is a web marketing term for promotional e-mail that recipients have previously requested by signing up via a website or special ad banner. Typically, web users are invited to sign up for promotional information about one or more product or service categories. Those who sign up have thus “opted in.”
Opt-out e-mail is a web marketing term for promotional e-mail that recipients have not previously requested by signing up. However, for MARI e-mail distributions, the contact’s e-mail address must have been provided to MARI by that individual via a MARI website, conference, or trade show. Individuals who have willingly given MARI their contact information via these methods are automatically added to e-mail distribution lists that benefit that individual. Although the individual is added to the e-mail distribution list on the concept of opt-out, the individual is ALWAYS given the opportunity to easily unsubscribe – without being hassled.
What is MARI doing to become “anti-spam?
MARI hopes that individuals find its e-mail communications informative and helpful. However, MARI respects the recipient’s wishes for either receiving or not receiving e-mail communications from us. Therefore, MARI has adopted the following as procedures for all of its e-mail distribution communications:
1.       Valid addressing
The e-mail communication will be sent to a single recipient with the intention of it being received by only one individual. The sender address will be a valid MARI e-mail address that is monitored by a MARI employee. Therefore the sender address can also be sent e-mail. The sender address will be relevant to the content of the message being sent.
For example, information sent from John Smith at Managed Account Research Incorporated will be sent from “jsmith@ma-research.com.”
2.       Valid headers/subjects
The e-mail communication will always have a header or subject that is appropriate and true to the content provided in the communication. The header or subject will not be used inappropriately or give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.
3.       Valid contact information
Any contact information in the e-mail communication will be real and relevant to MARI
4.       Valid subscribe/unsubscribe service
The e-mail communication will always have the “MARI Subscription/Register” information at the end. MARI’s website will always provide information on how to subscribe or unsubscribe to any of its e-mail distribution lists (see www.ma-research.com/register.php or www.ma-research.com/unsubscribe.html). The process to subscribe and unsubscribe is simple, real, and requires only a few seconds.
MARI also has a strict privacy policy posted on all their websites, which addresses the fact that information collected by MARI is not sold, but used internally for marketing and telemarketing campaigns.
5.       Relevant and beneficial information for the recipient
MARI attempts to provide honest information about our company, solutions, products, services, or other information which we feel will be in some way relevant and beneficial to the recipient.
6.       Mindfulness and compliance with company policies
MARI’s e-mail distributions will be mindful and in compliance with its current Privacy Policy as well as its Anti-Spam Policy which is in compliance with current international privacy-policy requirements.
