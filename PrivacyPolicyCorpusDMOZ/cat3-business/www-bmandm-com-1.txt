BM&M SCREENING SOLUTIONS LTD. CONDITIONS OF SALE
1. Acceptance: These terms and conditions are the complete and exclusive statement of the terms of sale of goods by BM&M Screening Solutions Ltd. (“Seller”), to the party purchasing goods (“Buyer”). Buyer agrees to all these terms and conditions by its issuance of a purchase order, acceptance of any part of the goods, or otherwise, which, along with these terms and conditions and any Seller quote, will constitute the “Agreement”. The Buyer’s placement, and/or acceptance by Seller, of any order is expressly conditioned upon Buyer accepting all these terms and conditions and any additional or different terms or conditions contained in Buyer’s order or otherwise will be deemed rejected and of no effect. Seller reserves the right to accept or reject all orders.
2. Terms of Payment: Terms of payment, unless otherwise stated, are net thirty (30) days from date of invoice. Seller will ship goods contingent upon reasonable assurance of payment. Payment will be made in full without deduction, delay, set-off or counterclaim. Time is of the essence and all delinquent amounts will accrue interest at 8% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is greater.
3. Shipment: Unless otherwise agreed shipments will be Ex Works (Incoterms 2010). Title and risk of loss to the goods will pass upon delivery to carrier. Shipments will be routed according to Buyer’s instructions, or if not specified, according to Seller’s convenience. If agreed, Seller will pre-pay transportation charges, which will be added to the purchase price. Partial shipments will be made only on approved request. If Buyer refuses shipment, or requests Seller hold goods pending shipment, Buyer will reimburse Seller one percent (1%) of the purchase price for each week shipment is delayed. Such fees are due upon invoice by Seller and goods will not be shipped until such fees are paid in full.
4. Cancellation/Buyer Delays: Unless otherwise agreed, if Buyer cancels an order prior to shipment, Buyer agrees to pay Seller, as liquidated damages based on a genuine pre-estimate of loss and not as a penalty, a cancellation fee, payable upon cancellation, in an amount equal to the following:

Upon the failure of Buyer to meet any stipulated commitment dates for its performance, Seller may, at its option: a) deem Buyer’s non-performance as acceptance/consent and proceed with performance of this Agreement; b) provide Buyer with written notice of a deadline extension; or c) deem Buyer’s failure to meet the deadline as Buyer’s cancellation of this Agreement subject to the fees described above.
5. Taxes: Prices do not include any duty or any national, state, provincial or local taxes, or other governmental charges. Buyer will pay all such taxes and charges.
6. Warranty: For one year from date of shipment, all Seller goods will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform, in material respect, to Seller standards, representations and specifications including any set forth in any Seller proposal and/or any drawings furnished by Seller and/or approved by Buyer. ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. Seller’s warranty does not cover expendable items subject to normal wear such as screen clothing, connecting sleeves or sealing strips.

7. Remedies: In the event of a breach of Seller’s warranty, Seller will, at its option, either: i) refund the purchase price; or ii) repair or replace the goods, or any part thereof. Remedies do not extend to any goods which have been manufactured to Buyer’s specifications, subject to misuse, neglect, accident, incorrect wiring or improper installation, or to goods used in violation of instructions furnished by Seller, or to goods which have been repaired or altered by anyone other than personnel authorized by Seller, or to goods which differ from the description as a result of changes made to ensure they comply with applicable statutory or regulatory requirements. In the event of a claim, Buyer will: (i) ensure the goods are intact for examination by Seller; (ii) provide written notice of the specific defect within ten days of the appearance and/or occurrence of the defect. The foregoing is Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any claim.

The impacted party will advise the other party of the occurrence of such an event within fourteen days thereafter. If such event lasts for more than sixty (60) days, the unaffected party may, with written notice, terminate this Agreement without penalty.

12. Assignment: A party will not sell, assign, or transfer this Agreement, or any part hereof, or any performance due hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party.
13. Change Requests: Buyer may request changes in the goods by written notice to Seller. Change requests will be in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Buyer. Seller will respond to Buyer in writing within fifteen (15) business days of receipt either accepting the hange, with a written proposed adjustment in price or schedule (if any), or rejecting the change.

Should the defaulting party not do so, the non-defaulting party may immediately terminate this Agreement for cause by written notice without any costs of cancellation. Without limiting its other rights or remedies, Seller may suspend performance of or terminate the Agreement with immediate effect by giving written notice to the Buyer if the Buyer fails to pay any amount due under the Agreement on the due date for payment and, on termination of the Agreement for any reason, the Buyer shall immediately pay to Seller all of Seller's outstanding unpaid invoices and interest. Termination of the Agreement will not affect any of the parties' rights and remedies that have accrued as at termination, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Agreement that existed at or before the date of termination.
16. Intellectual Property Rights. Seller will defend Buyer from any third-party claim that the goods infringe any third party’s existing United States, Canadian, United Kingdom or European Union patent, trademark, or copyrights and will pay Buyer any final assessment of damages incurred as a result of any proved infringement of any third party’s United States, Canadian, United Kingdom or European Union patent, trademark or copyright. Buyer guarantees that any specifications, projects, designs, information or services rendered by Buyer will be of such nature that will not cause any infringement to third parties’ intellectual property rights by Seller. Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from any such infringement claims.
17. Relationship of the Parties.
