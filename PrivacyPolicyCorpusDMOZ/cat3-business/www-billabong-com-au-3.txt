How do I earn points?
Every dollar you spend on Billabong.com.au when you池e logged in to your account earns you points towards vouchers to spend online. $1 = 1 point.
When do I get rewards?
You値l earn vouchers to spend online when you reach certain points balances. See below for the balances you need to reach and what value vouchers you値l receive when you hit them.
300 points = $15 voucher
600 points = $30 voucher
900 points = $45 voucher
1,200 points = $60 voucher
1,500 points = $75 voucher
1,800 points = $90 voucher
2,100 points = $105 voucher
When do I receive my reward vouchers?
Once you reach the appropriate points balance, you値l be sent your voucher via email within 48 hours.
How long do I have to use my vouchers?
You値l have 60 days to use your vouchers earnt from points. Other special offers like birthday vouchers might expire earlier. The expiry will always be listed in the email when you池e sent a voucher. Don稚 worry though, we値l remind you a couple of times before they expire.
What are the other benefits of joining Billabong Crew?
You値l receive access to special collections and promotions before anyone else. You値l also be sent offers only available to members. Keep your eye out on your birthday because we値l send you a special something then too!
How do I check my balance and see what rewards I have?
You can log in to your account to see your points balance and check what vouchers you have to spend.
What if my points don稚 get added to my balance?
You must be logged in to your account when placing any orders for your points to be added to your account. Please allow up to 48 hours for your points to appear.
Does my balance return to 0 when I receive a voucher?
After you reach the right point balance and an offer is sent to you, points available will be deducted by the number of points used to generate the offer
Do I need to use the whole value of my voucher?
You must use the whole value of the voucher in your transaction. If your order value is less than your voucher value, you forfeit the remaining value.
Can I use more than one voucher per transaction?
Unfortunately you can only use one voucher per transaction. You must apply your voucher as a coupon code and only one coupon code can be used per transaction.
Can I use my loyalty voucher with a promotional offer?
Unfortunately you can only use one offer per transaction. You must apply your voucher as a coupon code and only one coupon code can be used per transaction which means you're unable to use a voucher with a promotional offer.
Can I use vouchers on a previous order?
Vouchers cannot be applied retrospectively. Once you earn a voucher, you must place a new order to redeem it.
Can I redeem my loyalty voucher for cash?
No, loyalty vouchers cannot be redeemed for cash.
