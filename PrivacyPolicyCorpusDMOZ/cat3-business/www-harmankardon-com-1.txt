Security Policy
At Harman Kardon, we know that keeping your credit card information secure is important to you. That makes it very important to us. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128bit encryption technology to protect your online information.
How do we make sure information is secure?
We use the latest encryption technology (Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL) to secure your personal information. The information you provide when you place an order is encrypted (or coded) using a secure server for maximum security. This coding makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reach your information as it moves through our ordering system.
Certain browsers will not allow communication through secure servers. If this is the case, you won't be able to place an order online. If you have any problems placing an order online please print your shopping page and place your order by phone at (877) 871-6755. Please note that calls to (877) 871-6755 that are not made from a US landline may be subject to a charge.
To check the security of your computer, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Netscape, or the lower right-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Internet Explorer. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the encryption technology is active and the server is secure. You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser; when you access a secure server, the initial characters of the site address will be "https."
What if you link to another site?
Our website may provide links to other websites that are not under our control. Neither we nor the third party service providers who manage our website are responsible for these linked websites, their content or for the actions of the providers of such sites. We recommend that you review the privacy and security policies and terms of use for any websites you use.
Do I have to turn the security feature on when I want to shop?
The security features are automatic, and always on. You don't have to do anything but shop. Clicking "Checkout" on any page is all it takes to get started in our secure checkout process.
How do I know if I'm connected when I start ordering?
Once you've clicked the "Continue Checkout" button, your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm that it's communicating with our web-site. Once a positive ID is made, your order will continue securely.
Are all the pages on your web-site secure?
Most of the pages on our website provide information about Harman Kardon and our products. We make this information available freely and there's no reason for these pages to be "secure." The pages that we make secure are the ones on which you actually make the purchase, such as when managing your account, checking your order status, or within the "Checkout" area. For example, the entire checkout process, from introduction to final confirmation, is completely secure.
Is my information secure when it's transmitted across the Internet?
All of your information is encrypted before it's transmitted across the Internet, then decoded only after it arrives at our secure servers.
How do I report product security issues or vulnerabilities?
If you believe you have detected a vulnerability or risk to a Harman product or service, we want to hear from you.
To ensure proper handling of the disclosure in both directions, please adhere to the following instructions:
Submit your report in English to productsecurity@harman.com
Do not include sensitive information (other than information related to the vulnerability details) in any screenshots or any other documents you provide to us.
We can provide PGP public key to encrypt your submission.
Once we have received your message, an appropriate Harman employee will acknowledge receipt.
Note: Any information shared with Harman may be used by Harman in any manner determined appropriate by Harman, in its sole discretion. Submitting any information will not create any rights for the submitter, nor will it create any obligations to Harman.
