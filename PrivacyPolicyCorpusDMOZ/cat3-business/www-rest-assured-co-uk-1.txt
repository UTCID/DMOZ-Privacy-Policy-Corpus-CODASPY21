Using your information in accordance with Data Protection Law
Data Protection Law requires that we meet certain conditions before we are allowed to use your data in the manner described in this privacy policy.  We take our responsibilities under data protection laws extremely seriously, including meeting these conditions.  To use your personal data, we will rely on the following conditions, depending on the activities we are carrying out:
Compliance with legal obligations: As an entity established under the laws of England and Wales, Silentnight Group Limited is obliged to comply with UK laws and guidance provided by UK regulatory bodies. In particular, we will need to process your personal information to verify your identity, establish your age and to verify your source of funds for anti-money laundering and fraud purposes.
Necessary for the entry into / performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, a contract between you and us will have been entered into. In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (e.g. to allow you to purchase products from us), we will need to collect and process your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information on sign-up and financial information on entering into the transaction or objecting to this type of processing / exercising your deletion rights will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our goods / services to you.
Consent:  We may send you marketing messages by email about us and our products and offers where you have not unsubscribed and where you have purchased similar products from us. We provide easy ways to stop our marketing, and you can opt out at any time.
If you are not a customer of ours but have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then we may also contact you about our products.
In each of the situations above, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can object to processing of this nature.
Legitimate interests:  To use your personal data for any other purpose described in this privacy policy, we will rely on a condition known as "legitimate interests".  It is in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us with the information that we need to provide our services to you more effectively. Effectively, this requires us to carry out a balancing test of our interests in using your personal data (for example, in order to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us), against the interests you have as a citizen and the rights you have under data protection laws (for example, to not have your data sold to third party marketing companies without your knowledge, or not store your personal data in insecure or unstable countries or regions), which is set out below.
Legitimate interest
We have a legitimate interest in processing your information as:
you benefit from the provision of products and services;
we have a legitimate interest in recording calls to monitor staff performance, train staff, and improve our processes;
we will both benefit from the ability to enforce or apply rights under any contract between us;
we are required to ensure health and safety of our showrooms and have a legitimate interest in ensuring any processes are effective;
we have a legitimate interest in ensuring the security of our showrooms, and in assisting with the prevention and detection of crime;
we both benefit from the processing of your job application with us;
we both benefit from the provision of services and products where you are a supplier to us;
we would be unable to provide our products and services without processing your information.
Necessity
We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as we process your personal data only so far as is necessary to achieve the purpose outlined in this privacy policy.
Impact of processing
We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as the processing of your personal data does not unreasonably intrude on your privacy.
How long we keep your information for
When your data is no longer required for the purposes listed above, we will delete it within the periods set out below:
Marketing consents will be refreshed after 12 months;
CCTV will typically be deleted after 90 days;
Cookies are refreshed in accordance with our cookies policy [insert link to cookies policy];
Call recordings will typically be deleted after 1 year;
Unsuccessful job applications will typically be deleted after 6 months
Any other information will typically be deleted within 7 years from date of our last positive interaction with you to enable us to deal with any issues or concerns you may have about how we processed your order or otherwise, and also to allow us to bring or defend legal proceedings. This data is archived where you are inactive for a period of 12 months. In some circumstances, some of your data will be deleted in much shorter timescales, where possible (e.g. copies of marketing emails and other communications).
Marketing
We want to keep you informed about all our products, promotions and news, and where you have indicated you are happy to receive marketing email we will keep in touch with the latest news.
If you have previously purchased products from us and have not opted out from receiving marketing correspondence, we will contact you by email with information about products and services similar to those which you have already purchased from us.
If you have not made a purchase from us, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you with marketing if you have consented to this.
We may also send updates and marketing from our selected third parties about their products, promotions and news to you on their behalf where you have consented to this.
