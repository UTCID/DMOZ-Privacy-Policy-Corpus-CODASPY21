You may give notice to JAA at any time by letter sent by letter delivered by registered mail with return receipt to: 515 S. Figueroa Street, Suite 1900, Los Angeles, California 90071. All notices shall be deemed to have been given four days after mailing or 36 hours after sending by confirmed facsimile or email.MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONSAny action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. Federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Website shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California and to arbitration as stated herein. At the request of JAA, any controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”) may be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U. S. Code) (the “Act”). The Act will apply even though this Agreement provides that it is governed by the laws of California. Arbitration proceedings will be determined in accordance with the Act, the rules and procedures for the arbitration of financial services disputes of JAMS/Endispute, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company or any successor thereof (“JAMS”), except that discovery in said arbitration shall be limited in scope to the specifics of liability on the Claim, and any discovery related to damages calculations or any financials shall be withheld until after liability has been decided by the arbitrator(s). In the event of any inconsistency between the JAMS rules and this paragraph, the terms of this paragraph shall control. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and conducted in Los Angeles County, California. All Claims shall be determined by one arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million Dollars, upon the request of JAA, the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90) days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90) days of commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to an additional sixty (60) days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced. The arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a Claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph does not limit the right of JAA to: (i) exercise self-help remedies, such as but not limited to, setoff; (ii) initiate judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure against any real or personal property collateral; (iii) exercise any judicial or power of sale rights, or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies. In the event of any dispute (whether or not arbitrated), the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.This Agreement represents the parties’ entire understanding relating to the use of the Website and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting or additional, communications.
