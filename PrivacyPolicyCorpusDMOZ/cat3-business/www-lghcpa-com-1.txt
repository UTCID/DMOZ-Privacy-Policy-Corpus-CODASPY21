As an accounting firm, LG&H is an essential service.
For the safety of our clients and staff, our office is closed to the public and our staff is working remotely.
We can be contacted via phone and email.
All returns will be prepared and securely emailed or postal mailed to you. Since most returns are e-filed, we will provide you with a form 8879 for authorization. Please sign and email or fax it to us. If faxing or emailing is not available, we can make other arrangements for your authorization.
We want to extend all the best to you and your families in the troubling time. We are all dealing with many challenges, and will minimize the tax filing process as much as possible.
Sincerely
LG&H

In conjunction with a prospective purchase, sale, or merger of all or part of our practice, provided that we take appropriate precautions (for example, through a written confidentiality agreement) so the prospective purchaser or merger partner does not disclose information obtained in the course of the review.
As a part of any actual or threatened legal proceedings or alternative dispute resolution proceedings either initiated by or against us, provided we disclose only the information necessary to file, pursue, or defend against the lawsuit and take reasonable precautions to ensure that the information disclosed does not become a matter of public record.
To provide information to affiliates of the firm and nonaffiliated third parties who perform services or functions for us in conjunction with our services to you, but only if we have a contractual agreement with the other party which prohibits them from disclosing or using the information other than for the purposes for which it was disclosed.
