Security of Your Personal Information
TeleTracking is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. TeleTracking uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.

Controlling Unsolicited E-mail (“Spam”)
TeleTracking will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties.
