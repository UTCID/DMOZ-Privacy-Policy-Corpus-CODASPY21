How We Protect Your Information

For example, we have no control over the information collected by your Internet service provider or your employer (if the site is made available to you through your employer or if you send us personally identifiable information through your employer-provided email account), or information that you disclose in a public forum. Any such third party that collects your personally identifiable information may use the information in accordance with its terms and conditions of use (and related privacy policies), which may be different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for any information collected by such third parties and/or how such information is used or maintained.

We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and Users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as processing payments or sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Otherwise, disclosure of User personal information will be with the User’s consent, or where required by law.
