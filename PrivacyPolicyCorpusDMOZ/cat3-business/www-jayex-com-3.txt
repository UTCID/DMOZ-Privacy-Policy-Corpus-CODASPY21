Cookie Policy
What are Cookies?
We use cookies on Jayex websites. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. By using this website you have agreed to let us put Cookies on your computer.
Why are cookies essential to Jayex's websites?
This website, along with many others, uses cookies. Cookies let users navigate around sites and (where appropriate) let us tailor the content to fit the needs of our site's visitors. Without cookies enabled we can't guarantee that the website and your experience of it are as we intended it to be.

Types of cookies
The length of time a cookie stays on your device depends on its type. We use two types of cookies on our websites.

Persistent cookies stay on your device after you’ve visited our website. For example, if you tick the 'Remember my ID' box when you log onto Online Banking a persistent cookie will be used so that the site remembers your choice the next time you use it. Persistent cookies help us identify you as a unique visitor but don’t contain information that could be used to identify you to another person.
