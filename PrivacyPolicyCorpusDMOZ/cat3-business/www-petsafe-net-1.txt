RSC only processes personal data that a user voluntarily consents to provide to RSC. This information may include your name, date of birth, gender, address, IP addresses, product details, equipment or device, GPS coordinates or location data, additional usage and device data may be collected through the use of "Smart Products” and "Mobile Apps".

We ask that you provide us with certain information during the registration process. While you are not required to do so, if you are unable or unwilling to do so, you will not be able to complete the registration process, and therefore you will not be able to access and use certain information, material and services.

Children's Privacy
We take children's privacy seriously. This Website is not directed to children. We do not seek to collect personal information about children through our Website. We ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. If we learn that someone under the age of 18 has submitted information to us through any part of our Website, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that can be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and removed the information, we will honor that request.
Acquisitions and Other Reorganizations
Information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Protected Personal Information, may be disclosed to one or more third parties in connection with any change of ownership or control in RSC’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), and any such information may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Equally, information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Information, may be disclosed to one or more third parties in connection with any acquisition or merger carried out by RSC of such third parties.
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the terms in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. In the unlikely event that RSC or substantially all its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
Security
Perfect security does not exist on the internet and we cannot guarantee anyone complete security. Your privacy is important to us and we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private and would never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You understand that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collected from this Website. Please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users, are not encrypted. We strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential or sensitive information through these means. Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable; these service providers have informed us or the public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Information, by these companies.

Legal and regulatory reporting where disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action regarding injury or safety interference with the rights and property of RSC.

Opting Out

California Privacy Rights (“Shine the Light” Law) and California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
RSC does not sell personal data. RSC does not purchase / procure any personal data from re-sellers.
California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing use. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2016 will receive information regarding 2015 sharing activities).
No special pricing or incentives will be provided based on “opt-in” or “consent” status. Right to notice, Right to Access, Right to Know, Right to Opt-Out, and Right to Delete will be handled the same as GDPR Data Subject Requests, please see the “Access, Correction and Removal of Personal Data” section of this policy for more detail.
Privacy Shield Dissolution
At RSC we are aware of and continue to monitor changes associated with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (Privacy Shield). While we are actively certified and in good standing with Privacy Shield, we do not solely rely on Privacy Shield for data transfers between the European Union and the United States.
We currently have and will continue to ensure that Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and/or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are in place to ensure continuity of cross-border data transfers. In addition, RSC utilizes a Data Protection Agreement (DPA) with vendors and 3rd parties to ensure Data Security Standards (DSS) are in place.
“On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as “invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result of that decision, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States. This decision does not relieve participants in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield of their obligations under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.”
https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview
Personal Data of EU and Swiss Residents
The following section pertains to users which are in the European Union and Switzerland. RSC will transfer certain data to RSC in the United States. RSC will comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States.
RSC has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
In the context of an onward transfer of data to a third party, a Privacy Shield organization has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. RSC shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless RSC proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland have a right of access to their data. If you wish RSC to access and edit such data on your behalf, identity verification may be required to authorize transactions.
European Economic Area and Switzerland residents also have a right, if their personal data is inaccurate, of rectification, erasure or blocking of such inaccurate personal data. You may alternatively request RSC to rectify, erase or block the data by sending a certified letter, with a copy of your passport or national identity card (for identity verification purposes), to the above address with the exact nature of the requested action.
