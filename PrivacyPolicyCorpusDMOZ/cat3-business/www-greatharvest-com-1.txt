Privacy Information
Great Harvest Franchising, Inc. Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains what information that Great Harvest Franchising, Inc. (“Great Harvest”) collects on http://www.greatharvest.com/ (the “Site”), why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share this information with third parties. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on the Site and through use of the Great Harvest mobile application, and does not apply to information collected offline, including, but not limited to, information you may provide over the phone or when visiting a Great Harvest bakery or bakery cafe location. If you disagree with any part of this Privacy Policy, then please do not use any of the Great Harvest online services.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Great Harvest may collect some personal information that identifies you or relates to you as an individual. We will only collect personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, e-mail address, birthdate and telephone number, if you provide it voluntarily. If you are an applicant for a Great Harvest franchise and complete a franchisee application, we will collect financial information, business ownership information, occupation, and other details that you voluntarily provide through the application process. If you are a user of our internal training site, MyGH, we also collect your hire date, birthday and optional "About Me" information you choose to add to your profile.
In addition, Great Harvest may collect certain types of non-personal information such as: browser and device information/IP address, location information (when searching for a Great Harvest location near you), demographic information, and mobile usage data that may be collected through marketing activities and data analytics for the Site.
