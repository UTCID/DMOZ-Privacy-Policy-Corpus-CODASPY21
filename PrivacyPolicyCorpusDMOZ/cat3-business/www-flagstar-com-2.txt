YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT SUCH WAIVER AND RELEASE SHALL EXTEND TO ANY PARTY CLAIMING UNDER YOU AND THAT NO INSURANCE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY RIGHT OF SUBROGATION.
EXCLUDED DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NO FLAGSTAR PERSON WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION OR THE THEORY OF RECOVERY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR THE WEBSITE (INCLUDING LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 6.1.1 – 6.1.7), EVEN IF ANY FLAGSTAR PERSON IS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
DISCLAIMER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (A) THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT; (B) ANYTHING YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN AS PART OF OR THROUGH THE USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR SOLE DISCRETION AND SOLE RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICES OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MAY RESULT THEREFROM; AND (C) FLAGSTAR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT:
THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES WILL (I) BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; (II) MEET YOUR NEEDS OR REQUIREMENTS; (III) BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERRORS OR OMISSIONS; OR (IV) BE ACCURATE, ADEQUATE, USEFUL, COMPLETE, CURRENT, TIMELY, UP-TO-DATE, OR RELIABLE; OR
ANY DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES WILL BE REPAIRED OR CORRECTED.
CLARIFICATION. YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER FLAGSTAR NOR ANY OTHER FLAGSTAR PERSON WOULD HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES TO YOU IF YOU DID NOT AGREE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION 6.
INDEMNITY
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, you shall indemnify, defend, and hold all Flagstar Persons harmless from all Losses and threatened Losses arising out of or in connection with your violation of these Terms or your use of the Website and the Services (even if caused by the acts, omissions, or negligence of Flagstar Persons), including, but not limited to Losses and threatened Losses arising out of or in connection with circumstances described in Sections 6.1.1 – 6.1.7; provided, however, that Flagstar reserves the right (in its sole discretion upon notice to you) to take over the exclusive defense of any third party claim subject to indemnification hereunder, and in such event, you shall provide Flagstar with reasonable cooperation in such defense upon Flagstar’s request.
SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
Flagstar may suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website or the Services at any time and for any reason, including for violation of these Terms.  In the event of termination and for the duration of any suspension:
You shall no longer be authorized to use or access the Services or the Website.
We reserve the right to remove or delete any information that you may have on file with us, including any account or login information.
Any provision of these Terms that contemplates performance or observance during or subsequent to any such termination or suspension shall survive any such termination or suspension and continue in full force and effect, including, but not limited to, provisions relating to disclaimers of warranties, indemnities, proprietary rights, and limitations of liability (including waivers and releases of liability).
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
You irrevocably agree that any legal action, suit or proceeding brought by you in any way arising out of the Terms or your use of the Website or the Services must be brought solely and exclusively in state or federal courts located in Michigan, and you irrevocably submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of these courts in personam, generally and unconditionally with respect to any action, suit or proceeding brought by you or against you by Flagstar.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Flagstar may seek injunctive or other equitable relief or seek to enforce an arbitration award or other judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
GOVERNING LAW
These Terms and performance under these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable Laws of Michigan, without giving effect to any choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of such State or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction.
SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Terms conflicts with applicable Law or is held void, invalid or unenforceable by a court with jurisdiction over you and Flagstar, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of these Terms in accordance with applicable Law.  The remaining provisions of these Terms and the application of the challenged provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is void, invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each such provision shall be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by applicable Law.
