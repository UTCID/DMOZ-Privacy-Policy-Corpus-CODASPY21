Put simply, this includes data which either by itself or with other data held by us or available to us, can be used to identify you.

Due to the global nature of our business, your Personal Data will be stored and transferred to parties located in other countries, including outside the European Economic Area. These other countries will either have different data protection laws than your country of residence or they will not have data protection laws. They may not be deemed by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for Personal Data.
In particular, we store your Personal Data on servers in the United States of America. The US are not deemed by the European Commission to have adequate protections for Personal Data.  Steps will be taken to put in place safeguards (including around security) to protect your Personal Data when it is in these other countries.  This may include the use of European Model Clause contracts, where required under applicable law.  You can find out what these are online at the following address:  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm.  If you have any questions or wish to be provided with a copy please contact us (details below). Please note commercially sensitive information may be removed/blanked out from copies supplied to you.
