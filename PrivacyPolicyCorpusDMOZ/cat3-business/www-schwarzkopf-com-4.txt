Henkel and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated; provided, however, that Henkel need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned (“IP Disputes,” with all other disputes referred to as “General Disputes”). The party making a claim – whether you or Henkel – shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If Henkel is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in your Henkel account, if applicable. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then We have no notification or delay obligations under this Section 11(b). If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to Henkel Corporation, One Henkel Way, Rocky Hill, CT 06067 (Attn: General Counsel). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 11, or permitted by the applicable law.

The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by JAMS. We may have the right to pay the JAMS fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates’ lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers.

The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state of Delaware or, if sought by Henkel such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the courts in Wilmington, Delaware or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.

Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 11 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.
F. Class Action Waiver. As permitted by applicable law, and for users who are not individual residents of the province of Quebec, both you and Henkel waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 11 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.
G. Jury Waiver. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.

13. Update to Terms
It is your responsibility to review the posted Terms and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use this
SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF NEW TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE NEW TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Any new Terms or Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that We post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.
In the event any notice to you of new, revised, or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.
You can reject any new, revised or additional terms by discontinuing use of the Service.
14. Forward-looking Statements
The Service may contain statements that involve Henkel´s intentions, expectations or predictions. Such statements reflect the views of Henkel as of the date made with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements could be inaccurate or could become inaccurate as a result of developments occurring after their respective dates. Henkel disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise these statements.
15. Severability/No Waiver, Entire Agreement
If any provision of these Terms shall be found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. No failure on the part of Henkel to enforce these Terms shall constitute a waiver of any of Henkel´s rights under these Terms, whether for past or future actions on the part of any person. These Terms shall be the entire agreement between Henkel and you with respect to the subject matter hereto, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or modification of this Terms will be binding unless provided as an update by Henkel to this document, or signed in writing by an authorized officer of
Henkel.
