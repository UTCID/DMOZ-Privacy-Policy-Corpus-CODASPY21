Optimize Circles
I'd love to welcome you to my Optimize Circles.
I’m Dr. Rhoberta Shaler, The Relationship Help Doctor, and I’ve created a safe place of support for you, away from Facebook, so you can feel secure. Share your journey. Ask your questions. Learn, grow, and heal. In your life journey, you’ve likely met one or two of the relentlessly difficult, crazy-making folks I call Hijackals®. That’s what has drawn you to this group. I certainly have. I was raised by Hijackals, married, divorced and co-parented with one, and have been through some of what you are experiencing now. That’s why I want to help. I created the word, Hijackals®, to describe people who hijack relationships–for their own purposes–and then, relentlessly scavenge them for power, status, and control. It could be a parent, partner, ex, friend, or co-worker. I can help you if you’re with a Hijackal, have left one, or were raised by one.
