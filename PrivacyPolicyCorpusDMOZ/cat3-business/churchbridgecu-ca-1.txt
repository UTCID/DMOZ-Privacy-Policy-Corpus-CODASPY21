Privacy Policy
Our philosophy on privacy
Credit unions in Canada have a long history of respecting the privacy of their customers. As a co-operative financial institution, we are committed to developing policies, procedures and service offerings that address privacy concerns. We continue to protect your privacy and your right to control the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. We have procedures in place that guide our employees and directors in maintaining confidentiality. What has been our ongoing business practice has become our documented commitment to you.
Your credit union Board of Directors has adopted the Credit Union Code for the Protection of Personal Information, established related Policies and Procedures and appointed a Privacy Officer. Our employees understand the importance of the policies and procedures and follow them carefully.

Protecting Your Privacy
What You Need to Know about Protecting your Privacy
Your Personal Information
What is personal information?
Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. This includes, for example, an individual’s race, ethnic origin, colour, age, marital status, religion, education, medical information, criminal record, employment history, financial records, address, telephone number, e-mail address, Social Insurance Number, fingerprints, blood type, and tissue or biological sample.
Why do we collect it?
We hold personal information about members to help us meet and maintain the highest standards of financial service. This information can include your name, address, age, income, use of accounts and credit history.
We obtain this information from you directly, and from the product and service arrangements you have made with or through us. Information is also obtained with your permission from credit bureaus, other financial institutions and from the references you provide us.
Your personal information is collected for one or more of the following purposes:
To understand your needs and eligibility for products and services;
To open, maintain and administer your accounts and provide financial services that meet your needs;
To obtain credit reports and evaluate your credit rating and credit worthiness;
To administer and manage security and risk in relation to your accounts and the financial services provided to you;
To comply with legal and regulatory requirements;
To assist in dispute resolution;
To offer and provide you with other products and services of the Credit Union and of its affiliates and service suppliers.
The law requires us to ask for your Social Insurance Number (SIN) when you open an interest bearing account.  We also ask for your SIN to identify you with credit bureaus and other financial institutions for credit matching purposes.  Using the SIN is the best way to ensure the credit information actually refers to you.  Giving us your SIN is not a condition on service.
Who do we share your personal information with?
We use trusted and reputable suppliers to provide cheque and statement printing, data processing, research and payment clearing services.  We provide them with only that information which is necessary to perform the required services.  They are not allowed to use this information for any other purpose than what we contract them for.  Our suppliers and their employees are required to protect your information in a a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Code.
Your information is sometimes shared within the Co-operative Financial Services GroupTM of companies so we can offer you a full range of financial products and services. These affiliates include: Credit Union Members Insurance Society (CUMIS), Credential Concentra Financial, The Co-operators Insurance, Credit Union Payment Services (CUPS), CUETS and Celero Solutions. Any product or service offering that is derived from this sharing of information comes directly from us and not from our affiliates.
How can you access and verify your personal information?
You have the right to review your personal information held by Churchbridge Credit Union and to verify its accuracy.  To gain access to this information, contact us at the Churchbridge Branch.  We will respond to your request within 30 days or advise you if additional time is required to gather the information.  You will be charged a fee of $25 per hour to cover the expense of providing you with the information.
Should you discover upon review of your personal information that changes are required, please inform us.

Limiting Collection The collection of personal information is limited to the purposes we have identified for you.
Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention We will use or disclose your personal information only with your express or implied consent, or as required by law. We will retain your information for only as long as is necessary to fulfill identified purposes.

The Privacy Officer
The Privacy Officer is your point of contact if you wish to raise any matters regarding the use of your personal information.
The Privacy Officer is responsible for monitoring information collection and data security, and ensures that other credit union employees receive appropriate training on privacy issues and their responsibilities under the Code. The Privacy Officer also handles all privacy inquiries and personal information access requests under the Code.
Your consent
Depending upon the sensitivity of the information, you can provide us with your consent in writing, electronically or verbally.
We will obtain your consent in writing when you become a credit union member or when you apply for a new credit union service offering.
We may possess personal information about you that we collected prior to implementation of our Privacy Code, for which we do not have your express consent to use.  We will continue to use that information for the purposes listed in this brochure, unless you ask us to stop using that information.  This is considered implied consent.
We obtain or use your information only with your consent.  We do not sell it to third parties or use it in any way we have not told you about.  We obtain your consent before we:
obtain credit reports or check references;
contact you about other products or services of the credit union by direct mail, email or telephone;
share your information with our affiliates so that we can offer their products and services to you;
disclose your information to third parties unless we are obliged to do so by law or it is required for us to provide our financial services to you.
The following withdrawal of consent form provides you with an opportunity to limit the uses and disclosures of your personal information should you choose to do so. You may limit or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual obligations. For example, your credit union is required by law to provide a record of your interest earning information to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.
