Privacy Policy
Don’t worry – we respect your privacy and will not, under any circumstances share your information with any 3rd party because we hate spam just as much as you do.
If you create an account at Logodesign.com, we use a secure server (SSL) to encrypt all of your payment information. We also take precautions to protect any other personal data you may give us.
Our site links to other sites (particularly designer web sites). Our privacy policy doesn’t apply to those sites or any others we might link to. Once you’re on one of those sites, be cautious, we can’t be responsible for anything that happens outside of Logodesign.com.
We are based in the United States. As such, all data is held in accordance with United States laws which differ from those in other regions of the world, like the European Union. By using this service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these laws and policies.
This privacy policy may change from time to time. Those changes will be posted here, where you can review them at your convenience.
