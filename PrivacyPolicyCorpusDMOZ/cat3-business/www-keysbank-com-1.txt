Privacy
YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US!
You can trust us. First State Bank of the Florida Keys respects the privacy of all our customers and former customers. We consider any personal information you give us to be completely confidential, and we are committed to using this information solely for the purpose of providing a superior banking experience for you. We’ll never give out your personal information under any circumstances. Privacy is our priority.

CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT
We take the privacy of children very seriously. To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), First State Bank of the Florida Keys does not knowingly request or retain personally identifiable information from consumers under the age of thirteen.
The Bank's website is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a child under the age of 13, do not provide personal Information through this website. Please show this disclaimer to your parents, and do not use our website without your parents’ permission.
KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SAFE
Fraud is everywhere. Fortunately, First State Bank takes privacy and confidentiality very seriously. We do everything we can to keep customer information secure – but are you doing your part?
One of the best ways to avoid fraud is to become an educated consumer. Here are some tips that can help you avoid fraudulent websites and emails, and protect personal information from hacks, leaks and scams.
Watch out for copycat websites that deliberately use a name or web address very similar to, but not the same as the real one.  They’re trying to get you to click through to their site and enter your personal information, such as a bank account number, credit card number or Online Banking login information.
Always use your pre-established links to access websites, and don’t click on links in unsolicited emails.  If you ever receive a suspicious email representing itself as First State Bank, please forward the entire message to Support@KeysBank.com.
Make sure that your own personal computer has updated anti-virus and firewall protections.  Apply security patches for all of your programs and operating systems regularly.
On business computers, block all websites except ones approved for business use.
Create unique passwords, and change them regularly. Do not use birthdays or other numbers or words that may be easy for others to guess.  Never write down your password or give it to another person.
Monitor your account activity frequently using our free Online and Mobile Banking services.
Sign up for free E-Statements to avoid paper statements – they’re easy to steal, copy and compromise.
Set up free Security and Balance Alerts through Online Banking, so you can be notified via phone, email and/or SMS text message when there is login activity or changes in your expected balance.
Be sure to review our Security & Privacy links, which can be found at the bottom of any page of our site.
If you have any questions about security or possible fraud, please contact our customer service representatives at 305-296-8535 or toll free at 1-866-298-1858 or via email at Support@KeysBank.com.
