See the diagrams below showing both imperial and metric thread sizes. Measurements shown are in milimetres. Click on pump images to enlarge.Imperial Whirlpool PumpThe diameter of the thread should measure approx. 2 ¼ inches. The teeth of the thread are fairly course compared to that of the metric pump and, as shown in the diagram on the right, you should count 5 teeth per half inch.Metric Whirlpool PumpThe diameter of the metric pump is slightly wider than that of the imperial and should measure approx. 2 ½ inches. The teeth are quite smooth and closer together, measuring 7 teeth per half inch.Imperial Whirlpool PumpThe diameter of the thread should measure approx. 2 ¼ inches (diagram a).
