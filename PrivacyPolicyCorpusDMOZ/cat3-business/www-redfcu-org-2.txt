About Us
Every day, we work with our members to help them turn their dreams into reality. That’s more than just a promise. It’s fundamental to who we are.In 1951, Redstone’s original 11 members each placed $5 into a shoebox. Our first members on Redstone Arsenal envisioned a different type of financial institution—one that transforms lives and strengthens communities. More than 65 years later, their vision serves as the foundation for the Redstone you know today. With members all over the world and more than $4 billion in assets, Redstone is now one of the 25 largest federal credit unions in the country.Today, a $5 deposit is still all that’s required to join Redstone. We’ve grown considerably over the years, but our unwavering commitment to our members has allowed us to stay grounded in what matters most.We believe in giving back and getting involved.At Redstone, we’re serious about service. When we work together to build a strong community, we all live brighter. As a member-owned credit union, we give back to our members through better rates, personalized service, and customized financial education. We make a difference in our communities by donating, volunteering, and striving to be more eco-friendly.

Through the Redstone Discounts!® program, we are proud to support local businesses while helping our members save money.

Trusted AdviceThroughout our website you’ll find comprehensive advice on everything from planning for college to working through life’s unexpected challenges. And you’re always welcome to talk with a Redstone team member about how our products and services can best address your needs. We strongly believe in supporting each of our members on the road to financial independence, and we’re proud to offer strategies that are useful and effective.Free SeminarsRedstone holds free seminars throughout the year to discuss specific issues that affect us all, such as identity theft and retirement planning. These seminars allow Redstone advisors to explore topics in more detail and answer members’ questions in person.Financial CounselingAs an added benefit for our members, Redstone has partnered with BALANCE, a non-profit organization that provides free, confidential financial counseling on a wide variety of subjects, including managing debt and maintaining a budget. Redstone members can talk or chat online with experienced, fully-accredited BALANCE counselors by visiting the BALANCE website or by calling 1-800-777-7526.ScholarshipsRedstone’s commitment to education extends beyond financial advice. Every year, we offer more than a dozen scholarships to Redstone members who are pursuing a degree in higher education. It’s all part of our effort to support members as they look ahead and work to achieve their goals.

Are you a small-business owner? Busy parent? College student? Wherever you are in life, Redstone is your credit union! You are part owner, and we are here to help you reach your goals. Whether that means talking to a real person about your account, enjoying access to tailored financial advice based on your specific needs, or getting a great rate on a loan, Redstone is your trusted partner.Tailored SolutionsWe listen to our members’ feedback and constantly think about how to make our products and services even better. When members expressed their need for an app that would offer a convenient way to manage their accounts, we created the Redstone Mobile App. Focusing on functionality and ease-of-use, we designed the app to offer more solutions and choices for our members. We’re proud that the Redstone Mobile App was named one of the “Best Credit Union Apps” of 2014, 2015, and 2016 by MagnifyMoney. And we’re thrilled that our members love it too; they tell us that the app has simplified their lives in countless ways.Supportive NetworkWith 24 Redstone branches, mobile web banking, text banking, and thousands of surcharge-free ATMs in the US and abroad, it’s easier than ever to manage your finances from anywhere in the world. As a Redstone member, no matter where you go, you’re always an important part of the Redstone family.
Giving Back to Our Community

Giving Back to Our CommunityMaking a DifferenceRedstone Federal Credit Union® is one of the largest sponsors of civic, educational, and charitable non-profit organizations in the Tennessee Valley. Each year, Redstone supports more than 280 organizations in seven counties. Our pledge to give back takes many different forms, from sponsoring a Relay for Life team to building a playground for local children with special needs.Compassionate EmployeesRedstone employees are passionate about making a difference in the cities and towns we serve. On their days off, they choose to volunteer with dozens of organizations that enrich our communities. In 2015, Redstone employees volunteered more than 3,000 hours of their time to charitable causes. They also donated $172,000 to support the United Way of Madison County. The dedication of Redstone employees is a testament to our collective belief in the importance of connecting with our communities.OutreachRedstone participates in several events each week, many of which are completely free of charge and open to the community. At these events, festivals, and celebrations, we sometimes ask for donations for a deserving group, such as much-needed supplies for local public schools. We are extremely proud of Redstone’s history with our area’s military community, and we’re honored to support service members by sponsoring events with the Army’s MWR (Morale, Welfare and Recreation) on Redstone Arsenal.EducationThe life-long journey toward financial security begins with making sensible choices at a young age. That’s why we offer seminars for adults as well as money-management lessons for children at schools and organizations throughout the Tennessee Valley. Redstone’s financial education specialist teaches kids how to save and spend wisely using fun, age-appropriate tips. We offer this service free of charge so that the youngest members of our community can practice good habits early on and grow into financially-responsible adults.
LEED-Certified BranchesWe are committed to our community, and that means taking care of the environment in which we all live, work, and play. Redstone has three LEED-certified branches: Mills Road, County Line Road, and East Athens. A building must meet strict standards for environmental sustainability in order to receive this designation from the United States Green Building Council. All of Redstone’s LEED-certified branches were constructed with recycled and recyclable materials, LED lighting, water-saving bathroom facilities, and even native plants that require less water.Eco-Smart StrategiesRedstone is leading the way with innovative, environmentally-sustainable business practices. In every Redstone branch, we weave eco-friendly initiatives into our daily work. Every building includes an energy management system for the HVAC and lighting systems. LED lights and recycled carpet are used in all new construction and branch refurbishments. And we have recycling programs in place for paper, plastic, bottles, wood pallets, ink cartridges, computer equipment, and carpet.Going PaperlessOver the last few years, we have actively encouraged our members to opt out of paper statements in favor of electronic statements. Today, more than a third of our members have elected to receive eStatements, and that number is growing every month. Redstone’s eStatement initiative saves more than one million sheets of paper annually, as well as thousands of dollars on printing and postage.Responsible RecyclingEvery year, Redstone hosts “Shred Day” events that are open to the entire community. Hundreds of people bring their paper documents and electronics to be destroyed and recycled. In 2016 alone, Redstone collected and recycled more than 55,000 pounds of paper and almost 8,000 pounds of electronic equipment. In addition to providing members of our community with a convenient way to safeguard their personal documents and clear out their old computers, we are proud of the positive impact these events have had on our environment.
