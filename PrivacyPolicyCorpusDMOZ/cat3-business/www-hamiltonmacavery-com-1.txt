Protecting your Privacy on Panix
The Internet is huge, and growing at an enormous rate.
This may seem
a statement of the obvious, but it's wise to consider the implications
of that growth.
As in any boom town, the Internet and its growth attract their share of
hucksters, hawkers, predators, reprobates and malicious people.
Most
of them are fairly reasonable, but there are some folks you need to
watch out for.
Some are scammers, looking for a likely target.
Some
are kooks who may try to harrass you, and many of them will waste a
lot of your precious time if you let them.
Panix has been protecting the privacy of our users since our inception
in 1989, through a variety of means:
Protecting Your Real-World Information
Panix will not give out your real-world information (address,
phone number, even your real name if you choose to withhold it) to
anyone, at any time, for any reason short of legal obligation.
If
you want to protect yourself from harrassment, or just want to
stem the flood of advertisements directed at you, we will help.
Our No-Harrassment Policy
Our commitment to privacy also extends to our users.
Our rules and restrictions prohibit Panix
users from harrassing anyone, violating anyone's privacy, or sending
unsolicited commercial email or Usenet posts ("spam") over the
Internet.
Opt-in Spam Blocking
Panix provides opt-in
spam-blocking at the mail server via the Advanced Anti-spam
Options in webmail.
These powerful tools rejects mail before it even reaches
your account. Read about it.
Shared E-mail Filters
Even if you take precautions against giving out your information,
occasionally some unwanted email will get through.
At Panix,
we've implemented a
number of
features that you can use to cut down on the amount of spam you
receive.
Encryption and Authentication
There is a wide variety of software available to encrypt your
email and other communications, and to add greater security to
your login authentication.
Panix works to provide the greatest
possible compatibility with these programs, and support for the
ones which require server-side portions.
