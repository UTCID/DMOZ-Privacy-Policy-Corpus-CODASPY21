This Privacy Statement applies to ritchiebros.com and other Ritchie Bros. websites, services and solutions that collect information and display or link to this Statement, and that are owned and operated by a member of the Ritchie Bros. group of companies.  This Privacy Statement does not apply if the Ritchie Bros. website, service or solution does not display or link to it or where the website, service or solution makes its own privacy notice available.  This Privacy Statement applies equally to our digital handling of your information as it does to our offline collection and handling.
To understand which Ritchie Bros. company is responsible for the collection and further processing of your personal information, see the section below entitled "Data Controllers".
We may change this Privacy Statement at any time by posting the revised statement on this website and indicating the effective date of the revised statement.  The revised Privacy Statement will be effective once posted unless we state otherwise.

Or use our privacy contact form.
3. What personal information we collect and process
Our multiple solutions are designed to help your business Move, Build and Grow.
Most of the information we collect, and process, is equipment related information and business contact information relating to, and provided by, our customers' employees or other workers.  In general, information is collected when a customer engages one of our brand solutions to provide services by entering a contract, creating an online account, coming into one of our auction locations to register for an auction, providing us information through a webform, or otherwise interacting with us.  Information may also be obtained from other sources.  For instance, brand solutions may share information, or an outside service provider is used to verify or supplement what we've received.  In some cases, the information we obtain is generated automatically when users engage with our digital services, such as browsing our websites, using our mobile applications, opening our communications or clicking on our advertisements.
While our solutions are generally not targeted at individuals buying or selling for personal, family or household purposes, individuals do engage with certain of our solutions from time to time for these purposes.
Some information we obtain from you may be more sensitive in nature and depends on the services you are engaging us to perform.  For instance, we may require ID numbers from a driver's license or other identity documentation to process transactions or facilitate the extension of financing to your business. Some of this information may be considered more sensitive in nature.
Certain of our brand solutions obtain and store personal information for the benefit of our corporate or government customers to provide those customers specific technology services.  In those circumstances, we are acting as a service provider and collect and process that information in accordance with our customers written instructions and our contractual arrangement.
Offering you the choice of multiple solutions for different needs means that each solution operates somewhat differently.  To learn more about the categories of information handled by specific solutions and their sources, read on.

We also collect IMS end user credentials and interactions with the IMS to monitor, log, analyze and test the security of the systems, networks, databases and applications supporting the IMS and to ensure compliance by the customer with our contractual arrangements.  We also use this interaction data to monitor and improve the general performance and usability of the IMS such as enhanced features, GUI layouts, and page responsiveness.

4.2 Data sharing with OEMs and their dealers
As noted above, if you make a bid during a Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers or an IronPlanet sales event, we may share your bid and contact information with the OEM of the lot you bid on and any of the OEM's dealers or representatives in your geographic area, if the OEM or dealer/representative entered into a contractual arrangement with us.  We do not trade this information in exchange for money.  OEMs and their dealers or representatives use this information to pursue their legitimate interest of understanding the lifecycle of their equipment and the secondary market for their equipment, to communicate with you about their products and services, and for other purposes disclosed in their privacy policies. Once disclosed, this information will be governed by the OEM's or the OEM dealer's privacy policy and will be subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the OEM or OEM dealer processes the information. See "Privacy related requests and your preferences" below on how to opt-out of this sharing and how to request which OEMs and dealers your information was disclosed to during the 12-month period preceding the date of your request.  For more information, visit our "Data Handling and Sharing FAQ".
4.3 Data usage between Ritchie Bros. corporate family members
In pursuit of our common interests we permit access to personal information among members of the Ritchie Bros. corporate family for purposes consistent with this Privacy Statement. Where permitted by law, you may receive promotional and other communications from these related family members.  See our "Data Handling and Sharing FAQ" for more information.  To the extent that Ritchie Bros. corporate family members have access to your personal information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Statement.
4.4 Automated decision-making
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers and IronPlanet use automated decision-making technologies to assist in determining a user's bidding privileges and whether a deposit is required prior to bidding.  This processing assists us in protecting our interests and the integrity of our auctions and efficiently make decisions to extend to you the contractual right to bid at an auction.  Our decision on bidding privileges or a deposit may be reviewed by a Customer Care agent.
5. International transfer
Data we collect is transferred to database servers located in various regions, including Canada, European member states, Serbia and the United States. In addition, our personnel and our third-party service providers whom we transfer your information to for our business purposes may also store and access (and in the case of service providers, onward transfer to) your personal information in other countries. These countries may offer a different level of data protection and may have different data protection rules than your country of residence. In certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access your information.
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws, information about individuals who are entitled to protection under those laws may only be transferred from their region to other regions if certain requirements are met.  When we transfer your personal information from outside the EEA or UK, we rely on a variety of measures to support the transfer under EU or UK law, as applicable. As the European Commission and UK government consider Canada to be a country which provides adequate data protection, information may be transferred from the EEA or UK to Canada.  In other cases, we may rely on a service provider's registration in the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield (if sent to the US) and/or contractual means to require administrative and technological safeguards designed to mitigate the threat of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your information (such as standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC).  Please contact us if you have any questions about the transmission of information among members of the Ritchie Bros. corporate family or our transfers to service providers.
6. Storage and erasure
We and our service providers store personal information in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement or for which you are otherwise notified.  We will destroy or obfuscate data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy unless we are obliged to keep your personal data longer (i.e. for legal or audit purposes).  In general, Ritchie Bros.' retention periods are 7 years.  Permanent deletion of data can be difficult due to the impact on applications and systems.  Where legally permissible, we may restrict further access or usage of data instead of deleting it.
Retention periods vary by region, the service or product in question and applicable law.  We consider the following factors:
Is the information necessary to provide the service or product?  This covers things such as entering into a contract with you, performing the service requested or paid for, or maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
Is the information sensitive in nature?
What statutory, contractual or similar obligations exist?  This covers things such as retaining information as a result of contractual obligations or due to anticipated or pending legal disputes.  Certain laws also stipulate required retention periods for certain information.
What will the impact on the integrity of systems and applications be if the information is removed?
7. Data security
While we take reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the information you submit or that we collect online and offline against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free, nor are firewalls and physical access restrictions impenetrable.
If you believe your account has been abused, please contact us at customercare@ritchiebros.com.
8. Privacy related requests and your preferences
You may request to exercise the data subject rights described in this part by using our dedicated privacy contact form.  If you prefer, you can send correspondence to Ritchie Bros., Attn: Data Privacy Office, 9500 Glenlyon Parkway, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, V5J0C6, or call our Customer Service group.
California Residents.  If you are a resident of California, see our State Privacy Disclosures page for specific information on Your California Privacy Rights.
Access to Information.  In some jurisdictions, applicable law provides the right to be informed of and request access to the personal information we hold and process about you.  For instance, for individuals with rights under the GDPR, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal information concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal information have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged period for which the personal information will be stored, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal information or restriction of processing of personal information or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal information's source (where not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details.  Access to information may be subject to certain exemptions.
Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Data.  You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you.  For certain services, you may also use your online account profile page to review and edit some of your personal information.
Data Portability.  For individuals with rights under the GDPR, you may request personal information about you, that you provided to us, be delivered to you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
Erasure.  You can request that we erase your personal information and deactivate your applicable user account.  Please note that exemptions and restrictions may apply depending on applicable law.  In some cases, we will not erase the data, but instead restrict further processing (e.g. where the information is still necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or is needed to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim).  We may also obfuscate/pseudonymize or aggregate data where permitted.
Withdrawing Consent.  Where you have provided your consent to our processing of your personal information you may withdraw your consent at any time.  Please specify if the request is a general withdrawal or which specific consent you want to withdraw. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.
Restricting Processing. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict the ways in which we use your personal information. For instance, under the GDPR, where:
you contest the accuracy of your personal information;
the processing is unlawful but you oppose the erasure of your personal information;
we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
you have objected to the processing based on the grounds described in the next paragraph below and pending the verification whether we have legitimate grounds which override your own.
Objecting to Processing.  The GDPR entitles individuals to object to our processing their personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on our legitimate interest. If an individual entitled to do so objects to such processing we will no longer process their personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If personal information is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, individuals have the right to object at any time to the processing of their personal information for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
Lodging Complaints. You have the right to lodge complaints about the personal information processing activities we carry out before competent supervisory authorities. We hope though that if you reach out to us first, we can resolve your complaint amicably.  If not, then refer to the chart below under "Data Controllers" to see which supervisory authority to contact.
Email Communications. We use your email address to communicate with you in order to fulfill any contractual obligations with you (e.g. to send you invoices or settlement statements) and to notify you about important account information (e.g. updates to our terms of use or security notices).  These communications are mandatory.  Where permitted by applicable law, we may send you relevant marketing communications if you have registered and created a account through one of our websites (including rbauction.com, ironplanet.com, truckplanet.com, or govplanet.com) and agreed to our terms of use for your account. We may also send you marketing communications if you have contracted to sell with us or registered to bid in person at any of our live sales events and agreed to our terms at the time of registration. In certain jurisdictions, by doing so, you infer or imply your consent. If you reside in a country that requires that we obtain your express consent, we will ask for you to expressly opt-into communications. Marketing communications may come from the Ritchie Bros. entity that you contracted with when registering an account or registering to sell or bid, or from another member of the Ritchie Bros. corporate family that provides products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you are receiving marketing emails, you can unsubscribe from these marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive.
Data sharing with OEMs and their dealers. We provide you with the right to know what identifiable information and which OEMs and dealers and representatives we have disclosed information to for their use during the 12-month period preceding the date of your request.  Depending on where you live, you may have the right to request data for a greater period of time. To obtain a list of these OEMs, OEM dealers or representatives who we have disclosed your identifiable information to and/or to stop any further disclosure, use the privacy contact form or other options noted above at the beginning of this section.
9. Cookies & similar technologies and your preferences
When you interact with our online offerings and digital content (e.g. emails or banner ads) or mobile apps, we, our service providers and selected third parties may use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons and mobile identifiers) to make our offerings, content and apps better, faster and safer, to personalize our advertising across the web, or to provide users a personalized experience.

11. Other information regarding privacy
11.1 Responsibilities for receipt of information through services
When using our solutions, you may receive or have access to another person's information.  For example:
While we do not identify sellers and buyers on the IronPlanet marketplaces, certain sellers may offer inspection privileges in which case bidders will have access to name, address and contact information of an equipment manager to arrange for inspection
Once a buyer pays for items on the IronPlanet marketplace, they will receive information about the seller (name, address, contact information) to facilitate the pick-up of their purchases
Sellers advertising on the public Mascus marketplace receive the contact information of interested buyers when an inquiry is made through the contact functionality
Interested buyers have access to the name and contact information of a seller advertising an item in a listing on the public Mascus marketplace
You may use the information received or which you've been given access only to interact with the other person as part of your transaction or to comply with regulatory obligations.  You must comply with all applicable law and, in particular, provide the other person with any data subject rights to which they are entitled.  You are solely responsible for determining whether you may lawfully use the information received or accessed for other purposes.  Note that certain information may also be subject to usage restrictions in accordance with our terms of use or buyer terms and conditions.
11.2 Providing us with third party personal information
If you provide us with personal information relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of the person or the disclosure of the information to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
11.3 Children's privacy
Our solutions are not intended for use by children.  We do not knowingly collect information from users or participants who are considered children under applicable laws.  To participate in an auction or use our services, you must be 18 or older.
11.4 Logging in to IronPlanet's online marketplaces using your Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers web account
We permit you to use your Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers online web account credentials to log in to IronPlanet's online marketplaces.  To facilitate this cross-solution authentication, when you register an account with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, we automatically create a dormant account for you on IronPlanet that becomes active only when you first sign-in.
11.5 Logging in to a preferred provider's site using Ritchie Bros. credentials
We permit certain of our preferred partners to authenticate your online access to their website or webservices using your IronPlanet or Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers online credentials.  If you choose to do so, when logging-in you will be redirected to our website to enter your credentials.  Once you successfully login, you will be redirected again back to the partner's site. Your personal information collected by the partner when using their site will be handled by them for the purposes they disclose to you (such as in their privacy notices).
11.6 Links and Social Media Presences
Our websites contain links to other sites including sites maintained by our customers, third party service providers or preferred or recommended providers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy notices of all websites they choose to visit that collect personal information.
Ritchie Bros. maintains publicly accessible profiles in various social networks listed below. Our social media presence ensures an internet presence that is as comprehensive as possible – which supports our legitimate commercial and marketing interests.
Social networks are able to analyze your user behaviour when you visit their websites or other sites with integrated social media plug-ins, or you use their mobile apps.  When you're logged-in to your social media account and you visit our social media presence, or you click on a hyperlink to our social media presence and then log-in to your account, the social media operator associates your visit with your social media user account.  It may also be possible for the operator to identify you when you are not logged-in or do not have an account.  All of this is made possible by the placement of tracking tools on your browser or device that are associated with the social media operator.  These allow the operator to receive information from our websites which it combines with information it receives elsewhere on the internet or from other sources.
Social media operators use the information gathered about you to create user profiles that store your preferences and interests.  The profiles are used to tailor advertising to you based on your interests both within and outside of their respective social media sites and across any device you've used to access the social media site.  The information is also used by operators to provide anonymous measurement statistics and demographic data to us as administrators of our social media presence.  We use this data to create content more relevant to our target audiences.  For details of other uses of this data by operators, please refer to their respective privacy notices. For further information about our collection of data using cookies, web beacons and similar tools when you interact with our digital services, check out "Cookies & similar technologies and your preferences".
For individuals with rights under the GDPR, when you visit one our social media presences, we are jointly responsible as controllers together with the social media operator for the data processing activities triggered by your visit.  You may assert your rights against either of us, but please note, despite having joint responsibility we have no real influence over the data processing activities conducted by the social media operator.  Refer to the information below for the specifics of each social media operator.
