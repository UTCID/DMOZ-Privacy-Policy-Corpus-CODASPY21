WorldatWork Online Privacy Policy
Information WorldatWork Collects About You
WorldatWork collects information about you when you establish an account or place an order for products or services. Information also is collected when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback and download content or participate in online webinars. Website use information is collected using cookies.
WorldatWork’s website uses various forms and methods to make it convenient for you to request information, order publications, register for seminars or events, chat or post messages, or for us to contact you. This requires that you provide contact information, including your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and/or credit card information.
Each time you visit the WorldatWork website, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, not your email address. Aggregate information is collected on the pages you access and information you volunteer, such as site registrations. This information is used for internal review and improving the content of our webpages.
Cookies
Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information. This information is used to track visitor use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity.
For further information visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.
You can set your browser not to accept cookies and the above websites tell you how to remove cookies from your browser. However, some WorldatWork website features may not function as a result.
How WorldatWork Will Use Your Information
WorldatWork collects information to process any orders you make, manage your account and, if you agree, to email, phone or contact you by mail or fax about our organization and its products and services.
WorldatWork uses your information collected from the website to personalize your repeat visits to the website.
Using Online Community Discussions and Online Surveys
When participating in Online Community discussions, users are asked to review and abide by rules and etiquette points. By participating in the Online Community discussions, you consent to share certain personal data (including user name). Each WorldatWork member’s email address in the Online Community is a "blind" address, thus concealing the email address but still allowing messages to be sent. The Online Community message volume and the content of messages may be monitored to ensure proper use.
WorldatWork also surveys members and customers on key research topics affecting the profession and the field. All online survey data is reported in aggregate. No individual company data ever is released, identified or shared with survey partner companies. Unique survey identifiers (e.g., member identification number) are kept confidential and only used by authorized WorldatWork staff to contact with survey participants, if necessary. WorldatWork will ask for your consent to survey you; you can refuse to participate in that survey by not providing consent.

How WorldatWork Shares Information and Your Choices and Preferences

WorldatWork will not share your information for marketing purposes with companies outside the WorldatWork network of partners and vendors.
In processing your order, we may send your details to and use information from credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies.
Marketing
WorldatWork will send you information about products and services of ours and other related partner or vendor companies that may be of interest to you. If you have consented to receive marketing, you may opt out at a later date. At any time, you have the right to stop WorldatWork from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your information to our vendors or partners.

WorldatWork also will disclose your personal information
As required by law to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process. To the extent WorldatWork is legally permitted to do so, we will take commercially reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of a legal process. WorldatWork also may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including requests from national security or law enforcement authorities.
When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a written government request.
If WorldatWork becomes involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure that the acquiring organization agrees to protect your personal information in accordance with the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy and that the acquiring organization will provide notice before personal information, customer information or business information becomes subject to a different privacy notice.
To any other third party as described in this section of the policy and earlier in the “Marketing” section of this policy with your prior consent to do so.
WorldatWork will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not otherwise sell your personal information to third parties.

In addition, if you have consented to receive email from vendor and partner companies of WorldatWork, you will receive periodic messages from WorldatWork Local Network partner associations, research partners, vendors and consulting partners. We offer you the opportunity to regulate the type of email communications you receive from us by modifying your preferences.
You can change your preferences at any time. Go to My Profile (you must be logged in) and select "Edit Info" under your name in the left navigation. You may change your preferences on your Account Information page.
