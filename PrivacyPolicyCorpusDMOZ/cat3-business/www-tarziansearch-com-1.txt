Packages“This facility is great. I've been working out of my home office for a few years now, but I can still have the "big company look" with the use of their boardroom. The staff is friendly, and they have a nice waiting area. All around, it's a great place to do business.”Cameron Robinson, Just Get It Done, 1001 Avenue of Americas“I have been renting an office at Corporate Suites Business Centers for almost four years. I am so pleased with their services that I can't think of a single reason to go somewhere else. The staff are extremely professional and the building and offices are kept in pristine conditions. I highly recommend it.”Evie Irbania Tavares, Profam Advisory Services, 641 Lexington Ave“Our organization leased several offsite suites in the building. The space is beautiful and contemporary,
in a great location for traveling! We especially appreciate the office staff and front desk security. Very reliable, dependable and helpful! We love it here. I moved my offices several times and this is by far the nicest place to
be in Manhattan.”JJ Ferre, Hospital for Special Surgery, 641 Lexington Ave“I have been at Corporate Suites for 15 years. They are like my family, only with excellent services and beautiful offices.
They work hard to accommodate my professional needs and my business has grown because of them. Reception treats all my clients with respect and often clients will comment how nice everyone is. They also work hard to create a sense of community.”Joshua Blau, Josh Blau CPA, 1180 Avenue of Americas“Corporate Suites is an amazing environment to work in. The atmosphere is professional and engaging and the staff is simply fantastic. Always upbeat, cordial, and they make you feel very comfortable and welcoming! The other clients from around the world that you meet makes it a very interesting work place.”Denise Andrades, Furniture Rentals, 2 Park Ave“Corporate Suites provide a great environment, location, and staff. It has been extremely convenient because leasing arrangements provided a desired flexibility for our company's expansion. It truly provided a great opportunity for our business to be in a central New York City location with great amenities while allowing us to grow.”George Gellis, Gellis Law Group, 22 Cortlandt StMeet the Office Community!Our community is diverse, friendly and always looking to grow.
