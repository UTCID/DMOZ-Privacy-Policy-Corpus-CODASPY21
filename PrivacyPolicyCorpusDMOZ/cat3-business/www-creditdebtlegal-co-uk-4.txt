A SINGLE BUSINESS DEBT
A single Debt or a batch of Debts owing by UK enterprises our standard Commission is 10%  + VAT.
Debts under £200.00 collected we charge £20.00 +VAT minimum.   Often more work goes into collecting a small debt than a large one.  We attempt to recover more than the debt owed to you, to partly offset the charges that we make for our success. This of course is dependent upon the debtor paying the additional sum. We are reasonably successful in this regard but the liability to pay us remains with you.
YOU PAY US NOTHING if we don’t collect part of the whole of your debt.
Phone us now on 0845 521 3628 (lo-cal) or 020 7405 4120.
