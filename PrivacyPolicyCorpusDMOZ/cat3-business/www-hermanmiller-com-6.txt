Herman Miller Accessibility Statement
Herman Miller is committed to making its communications accessible to everyone. We will make every reasonable effort to ensure our website conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A & AA and complies with applicable accessibility laws.
To ensure that we’re as inclusive as possible, we’ve partnered with a third-party digital accessibility vendor to manage our digital accessibility program. Their diverse team of accessibility professionals, including people with disabilities who are trained in digital accessibility, evaluates and audits our digital properties on an ongoing basis to provide our customers the best digital experience.
Our website uses industry-standard techniques and preferred practices to provide the highest possible level of accessibility for our users. These include, but are not limited to, the characteristics of usability for screen reader users, keyboard-only users, users with low vision, users who are deaf or hard of hearing, and users who are color blind, as well as those with learning or cognitive disabilities, and the aging population.
If you have difficulty accessing our digital properties, or if you have feedback on how we can improve your online experience, please contact us at hmcustomercare@hermanmiller.com.
