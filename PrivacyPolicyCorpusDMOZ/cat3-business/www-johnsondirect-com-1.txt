Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.Johnson Direct reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into JohnsonDirect.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.

Use of Web Beacons or GIF files
Johnson Direct’s Web pages at www.JohnsonDirect.com or our other agency-managed sites and redirected domains may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow Johnson Direct to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Johnson Direct may include Web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. Johnson Direct prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
