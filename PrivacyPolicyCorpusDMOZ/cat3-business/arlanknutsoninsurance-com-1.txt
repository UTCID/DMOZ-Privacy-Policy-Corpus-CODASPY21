account number) using Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology. SSL is a proven
coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data
before you send it to us. To support this technology, users must have an
SSL-capable browser. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies
available. While we use such sophisticated security technology to secure users’
ordering information, user name, and password, we cannot guarantee that any
electronic commerce is totally secure.
