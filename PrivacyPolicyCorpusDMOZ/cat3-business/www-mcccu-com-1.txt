When using the services, the member will not be permitted to pay bills from, or transfer funds out of any Account on which more than one signature is required to authorize a transaction, unless prior authorization is received in writing from all required signers. The Member agrees to follow the instructions of the Credit Union in effect from time to time with respect to the use of the services.When a Password is used to conduct any Transaction, the authorization given at the time of the Transaction will be treated as if it was given by the Member in person, and the Member agrees to be bound by each such Transaction. The Member irrevocably authorizes and directs the Credit Union to debit or credit, as the case may be, the amount of any Transaction to the Account or Accounts designated by the Member at the time of the Transaction, in accordance with the Credit Union’s normal practices. The Credit Union’s practices respecting the debiting or crediting of any Transaction under any of the services may be revised from time to time with or without notice to the Member.The Member agrees not to conduct or try to conduct any Transaction that would result in a negative balance in any Account or would exceed the unused balance of any authorized overdraft or line of credit, if available. The Member will indemnify the Credit Union for all liability or loss arising out of any such Transaction.LimitationsThe Member agrees that the services will be available only on an "as is" and "as available" basis.The Credit Union offers the services in order to improve the accessibility of the Credit Union to its Members. However, the provision of services is dependent in part on communication lines and other third party equipment and services. The member agrees the credit union will not be liable for any delay, loss, damage (direct, indirect or consequential) or inconvenience whatsoever caused by or arising from the provision of or failure to provide services or the malfunction or failure to operate any software or equipment for any reason whatsoever. In no event will the credit union be liable for any personal injury, or property damage or any loss of business or profit or other indirect or consequential damages whatsoever.Confidentiality of PasswordThe Password is for the Member’s use alone and may not be assigned or transferred.

The Member agrees not to record the Password in any manner or on any media, whether in writing or otherwise, including without limitation in electronic form, or by voicemail or e-mail. For security reasons, the Credit Union recommends that each Member change the Member’s Password on a regular basis, such as every 90 to 120 days. If the Password becomes known to other than a Signing Authority on the Account, confidential information about the Member’s Account may be accessed.Transaction verification and recordsAll Transactions are subject to verification and acceptance by the Credit Union, and if not accepted will be reversed from the Account. Verification may take place on a date later than the date the Member authorized the Transaction, which may affect the Transaction date.The Credit Union’s records of each Transaction, and the Credit Union’s accounting records, will be deemed to be correct, and will be conclusive and binding upon the Member. Any record of a Transaction generated by the Software will be for the Member’s convenience only. If the Member believes that the Credit Union’s records contain an error or omission, the Member must give written notice of the suspected error or omission to the Credit Union within the time provided in the Application for Membership and Account Operation Agreement between the Member and the Credit Union for the relevant Account or Accounts.If the credit union does make an error or omission for any reason, with respect to the recording of any transaction, the liability of the credit union will be limited to the amount of the error or omission in recording, plus any applicable service charges that may have been charged to the member by the credit union.

Until the Credit Union’s acknowledgment is received by the Member, notification is not deemed to be received by the Credit Union.TerminationThe Credit Union may at any time without notice withdraw permission to use any of the services, or cancel or alter any of the services without being liable for any loss resulting from such action. If the Credit Union withdraws permission to use the services, or if the Member no longer wishes to use the services, the Member will immediately return to the Credit Union the Software, instruction manuals and any Equipment provided to the Member by or on behalf of the Credit Union. The Software licence granted in this Agreement will be terminated effective upon the withdrawal of the services by the Credit Union. The termination of services for any reason will not relieve the Member of any obligations under this Agreement with respect to the services.Changes to AgreementThe Credit Union can add to or change the terms and conditions of this Agreement from time to time, but the Credit Union will give at least 30 days notice of any such additional or amended terms and conditions. The 30-day notice will run from the date a notice is mailed or is first displayed at the branch or on sign-on screen. If the Member continues to use any of the services after the effective date of any additional or amended terms or conditions to this Agreement, then the Member will be deemed to have accepted such additional or amended terms or conditions.Other AgreementsThe terms and conditions of the Application for Membership and Account Operation Agreement with the Credit Union and any other conditions or agreements between the Member and the Credit Union regarding any Accounts shall remain in full force and effect and shall apply to each Transaction, except as expressly modified by the terms of this Agreement. If there is a conflict between any provision of any of these other agreements and this Agreement, this Agreement will prevail with the exception that the Application for Membership and Account Operation Agreement between the Member and the Credit Union will prevail over this Agreement.ExecutionThis Agreement may be executed in several counterparts or electronically. When executed in counterparts, each counterpart shall be deemed to be an original and such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument and notwithstanding the date of execution shall be deemed to bear date as of the date written below. When executed electronically, use of services shall be deemed to be acceptance of the terms and conditions hereof as of the date of first use.GeneralIf the Member is the joint holder of an Account, then each joint holder of that Account will be jointly and severally liable for all Transactions conducted using the services with respect to that Account.
