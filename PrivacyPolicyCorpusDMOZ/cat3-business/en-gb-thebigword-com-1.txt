Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
If you believe that the Company has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Information Commissioner.
5.9 What if you do not provide personal data?
You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to the Company during the engagement process. However, if you do not provide the information, the Company may not be able to process your application properly or at all.
6. Agencies
6.1 Why do we collect personal data about you?
The Company will collect personal data about you or those providing services on your behalf in order to progress with the Agency engagement process.
Unless expressly stated otherwise elsewhere in this policy, “you” or “your” includes your employees, agents and sub-contractors and, in the case of a company, your directors, shareholders, officers, employees, managers, members, partners, principals and associated or affiliated companies; if you are not a company then your individuals or entities in similar positions.
“Personal data” (or personal information), means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified, either just from that information alone, or together with other information we hold.
6.2 What personal data do we collect about you and how?
As part of our Agency engagement process, the Company will collect and process personal data where it is necessary. The Company is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.
As part of our Agency engagement process the Company will collect a range of information about you. This could include (and is not limited to):
your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;
details of your qualifications, rates of pay, specialisms, languages, gender, university graduation dates, experience and employment history;
information to verify your identity and entitlement to work in the country of residence;
your photograph so that we can provide you with an ID pack.
The Company may collect this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment.
Personal data may be sourced through information you have posted on job boards or social media sites such as LinkedIn where you have stated that you are currently available for work.
The Company may also collect personal data about you from third parties, in order that background checks can be undertaken. Background checks (such as copies of DBS checks), identity verification information (such as copies of a passport and passport number, expiration date and country of residence, driving licence or identity card), proof of address and references. The background and identify verification checks we carry out (unless subject to specific Client requirements, as explained below), may entail the Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks (see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard for more details). The Company carries out these checks as it works regularly with government bodies who require them to be carried out and it is contractually obliged to do so.
6.3 How do we use your personal data?
The Company will collect and process your personal data where it is necessary:
to allow us to enter into and/or perform our terms of engagement with you;
to pursue legitimate interests of our own, or of third parties, such as our Clients, provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests;
to fulfil our legal obligations; and/or
with your consent.
We need this information in order to engage you as an Agency and without it we will not be able to add you to our list of approved Agencies. In some cases we may also carry out (where required by our Clients or otherwise necessary) enhanced security clearance checks which we will use to assess your suitability before engaging you as an Agency and to engage you to carry out work assignments for our Clients. If such checks are required, we will inform you that we intend to carry out these checks on you. If you do not meet the requirement of the enhanced security clearance checks, then you may not be able to be engaged as an Agency for certain Clients, but this will not affect your suitability for any potential future engagements with other Clients.
6.4 Who is your personal data shared with?
Your information may be shared internally for the purposes of the engagement exercise.
We will also share your data with the third parties set out below:
any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (set out in Appendix A.);
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or Terms of Use;
a training company which we consider may be able to assist you in obtaining a qualification and/or to provide you with courses which we consider may be of interest to you;
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer; or
if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal/data held by us will be one of the transferred assets.
our auditors who ensure we maintain our ISO standards.
our clients or prospective clients.
We will share your personal data with other entities in our group as part of our regular reporting activities on Company performance, in the context of a business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise, for system maintenance support and hosting of data.
The Company will not share your data with any other third parties, unless your application is successful. The Company will then share your data to obtain references for you, background check providers to obtain necessary background checks and the Disclosure and Barring Service to obtain necessary criminal records checks. These are in addition to the other organisations as set out in our Service Agreements. The Company will not transfer your data outside the European Economic Area.
6.5 Change of Purpose
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
6.6 Storage of your personal data
If your application to become an Agency is unsuccessful, the Company will hold your data on file for 3 months from the relevant engagement process. If you agree to allow the Company to keep your personal data on file, the Company will hold your data on file for a further period for consideration for future engagement opportunities. At the end of that period, or if you withdraw your consent prior to that date, your data is deleted or destroyed.
If your application to become an Agency is successful, personal data gathered during the engagement process will be transferred to your file and retained during your time as an authorised Agency.
We will retain your data for so long as your agreement with us remains in force. At the end of that period, your data will be deleted or destroyed.
Data will be stored in a range of different places, including on your application record, in Agency management systems and on other IT systems (including email).
6.7 Safeguarding your personal data
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy, such as ISO27001 (2013) Information Security Management System and the Cyber Essentials Plus scheme. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website. Any transmission is at your own risk.
All our third-party service providers and other entities in the group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data in line with our policies. We require these third parties to treat your personal data in accordance with data protection laws law and to keep it confidential. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
The Company takes the security of your data seriously. It has internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties. Further details can be found in the Company’s Information Security Policy, Information Security Coordination, User Access Management policy, and Secure Development Policy.
