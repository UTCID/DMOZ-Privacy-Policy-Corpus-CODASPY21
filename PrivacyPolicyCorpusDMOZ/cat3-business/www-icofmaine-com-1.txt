Client Testimonial
I have been thoroughly impressed with Scott’s knowledge and understanding of the Insurance industry. Working with a consultant of Scott’s caliber certainly makes my job as CEO a lot easier, as it is nearly impossible to stay on top of all the changes in the industry. Knowing that we have the proper type and amount of insurance protection is very comforting. Scott has been very easy to work with and extremely responsive to all my questions and concerns.

Northeast Bank has made it a regular practice to review the status of our various insurance policies and we are very pleased with Scott’s ability to deliver real value in the form of personalized service and quality information. Scott does an excellent job of explaining the various issues and identifying opportunities that result in the right level of coverage for our institution.
