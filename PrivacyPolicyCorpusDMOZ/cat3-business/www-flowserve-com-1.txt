This Privacy Notice explains our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Data is collected and used through our websites.
Flowserve and its affiliates (collectively “Flowserve”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) maintain and operate this and other websites including applications (collectively, the “Flowserve Websites” or “Websites”). Because some applications, such as those hosted by a third party on our behalf, may require additional information, or use information in a different way, they may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions. These applications may also offer you additional choices for managing your Personal Data.
APPLICABILITY OF THIS PRIVACY NOTICE
This Privacy Notice applies to all visitors and users of the Flowserve Websites. Because Flowserve is a multinational corporation, we may adopt separate privacy policies or additional provisions as necessary to reflect the requirements of applicable local laws in the countries in which we operate.

Such Personal Datawill be processed only for lawful and appropriate purposes. Flowserve has implemented reasonable measures designed to secure Personal Data and to prevent unauthorized or accidental access, erasure, or other misuse of personal data. Flowserve will facilitate the exercise of Data Subject rights in an effective and transparent manner.
APPLICATION OF ADDITIONAL TERMS
The Additional Terms for EU and EEA Visitors and Users applies when:
The Data Subject creates or shares Personal Data via a relationship with Flowserve and is located within the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA);
Such relationship is within the scope of GDPR; and
Flowserve functions as a Data Controller when processing the Personal Data for such Data Subject.

HOW WE CONDUCT CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Flowserve may transfer your Personal Data across borders to Flowserve and our representatives, affiliates, third party partners and service providers in the United States and other countries where we do business. In the event of a cross-border transfer of your Personal Data, if the country to which we transfer your Personal Data is not a recipient of an adequacy decision from the European Commission, and if the transfer is not made under a derogation that does not require additional suitable protections, then we provide appropriate or suitable safeguards for such cross-border transfers as required by law, via the EU standard contractual clauses.

RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA
Flowserve retains your Personal Data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes for which it was collected, and as permitted by applicable law.

We may retain backups and archives that may include your Personal Data as long as reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law.
SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA
Flowserve will not, other than in exceptional circumstances, collect and process any special categories of your Personal Data.

In certain circumstances, Flowserve will need to use your Personal Data even though you may have asked us to delete or restrict or if you objected to our use of it. If this is necessary, we will do so in a lawful, fair and transparent manner. Furthermore, if you revoke consent, prior uses and disclosures will not be affected, and we may otherwise continue to process Personal Data as permitted or required by law.
