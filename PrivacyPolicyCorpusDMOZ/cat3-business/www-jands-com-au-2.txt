Acceptance2.1 The Buyer agrees that the Buyer is bound by these terms and conditions and accepts these terms and conditions without alteration or erasure (including, without limitation, the security agreement contained in these terms and conditions) by doing any of the following:(a) signing a document containing these terms and conditions;(b) signing an order form that refers to these terms and conditions; or(c) by accepting delivery of, or taking possession of, any Goods.2.2 Where the Buyer comprises more than one person each of those persons shall be jointly and severally liable for all payments of the Price.2.3 The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller may provide Exclusive Offerings (“Exclusives”) to other Customers. The Seller is under no obligation to provide any Exclusives to the Buyer, and the Seller will not be liable to the Buyer where Exclusives have been offered to another Customer.2.4 The Buyer acknowledges and accepts that the products offered to the Buyer are at the sole discretion of the Seller, and may be varied from time to time by the Seller, and the Buyer expressly agrees that the Buyer will have no recourse against the Seller in relation to such changes.2.5 The Seller has an expectation that the Buyer will not sell or market any similar product that is of a type or style that creates confusion or misleads the general buying public without the prior express consent of Seller. In agreeing to sell products to the Buyer, the Seller has considered that the Buyer does not and will not sell into the market either goods which are replica or reproduction or falsely branded or "knock off" goods of the same style as the products supplied by the Seller, and will not sell identical parallel-imported products, and that the Buyer agrees that it will not sell such goods in the Australian market w without the express consent of the Seller.2.6 Upon acceptance of these terms and conditions by the Buyer the terms and conditions are irrevocable and can only be rescinded in accordance with these terms and conditions or with the written consent of the manager of the Seller.2.7 None of the Seller’s agents or representatives are authorised to make any representations, statements, conditions or agreements not expressed by the manager of the Seller in writing nor is the Seller bound by any such unauthorised statements.2.8 The Buyer undertakes to give the Seller not less than fourteen (14) days prior written notice of any proposed change in the Buyer’s name and/or any other change in the Buyer’s details (including but not limited to, changes in the Buyer’s address, facsimile number, or business practice).2.9 In the event that the Buyer has entered into a Dealer Agreement with the Seller and there is an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of that Dealer Agreement and these terms and conditions, the terms and conditions contained in the Dealer Agreement shall prevail to the extent of that inconsistency.
3. Goods3.1 The Goods are as described on the invoices, quotation, work authorisation or any other work commencement forms as provided by the Seller to the Buyer.
4. Price And Payment4.1 At the Seller’s sole discretion the Price shall be either;(a) as indicated on invoices provided by the Seller to the Buyer in respect of Goods supplied; or(b) the Seller’s quoted Price (subject to clause 4.2) which shall be binding upon the Seller provided that the Buyer shall accept in writing the Seller’s quotation within thirty (30) days.4.2 Time for payment for the Goods shall be of the essence and will be stated on the invoice, quotation or any other order forms. If no time is stated then payment shall be on delivery of the Goods.4.3 A handling fee of $15.00 applies to each order placed with the Seller. The fee is only charged once per order even if the order is part delivered.4.4 The Seller may withhold delivery of the Goods until the Buyer has paid for them, in which event payment shall be made before the delivery date.4.5 At the Seller’s sole discretion, for certain approved Buyers payment will be due seven (7) days following the date of the invoice.4.6 Payment will be made by cash on delivery, or by cheque, or by bank cheque, or by direct credit, or by any other method as agreed to between the Buyer and the Seller.4.7 The Price shall be increased by the amount of any GST and other taxes and duties which may be applicable, except to the extent that such taxes are expressly included in any quotation given by the Seller.
5. Delivery Of Goods / Services5.1 Delivery of the Goods shall be made to the Buyer’s address. The Buyer shall make all arrangements necessary to take delivery of the Goods whenever they are tendered for delivery, or delivery of the Goods shall be made to the Buyer at the Seller’s address.5.2 The Seller will deliver the Goods to Accredited Dealer’s Australian business address freight free via the Seller’s nominated carrier. Goods made to special order and one-off Goods may attract a freight cost. All other delivery methods are delivered as freight to pay.5.3 Delivery of the Goods to a carrier, either named by the Buyer or failing such naming to a carrier at the discretion of the Seller for the purpose of transmission to the Buyer, is deemed to be a delivery of the Goods to the Buyer.5.4 The failure of the Seller to deliver shall not entitle either party to treat this contract as repudiated.5.5 The Seller shall not be liable for any loss or damage whatever due to failure by the Seller to deliver the Goods (or any of them) promptly or at all.
6. Insurance Payments in the Event of Damage6.1 If any of the Goods are damaged or destroyed prior to property in them passing to the Buyer, the Seller is entitled, without prejudice to any of its other rights or remedies under these Terms and Conditions of Trade (including the right to receive payment of the balance of the Price for the Goods), to receive all insurance proceeds payable in respect of the Goods. This applies whether or not the Price has become payable under the Contract. The production of these terms and conditions by the Seller is sufficient evidence of the Seller’s rights to receive the insurance proceeds without the need for any person dealing with the Seller to make further enquiries.
7. Buyer’s Disclaimer7.1 The Buyer hereby disclaims any right to rescind, or cancel the contract or to sue for damages or to claim restitution arising out of any misrepresentation made to him by any servant or agent of the Seller and the Buyer acknowledges that he buys the Goods relying solely upon his own skill and judgement and that the Seller shall not be bound by nor responsible for any term, condition, representation or warranty other than the warrantygiven by the Manufacturer which warranty shall be personal to the Buyer and shall not be transferable to any subsequent Buyer.
8. Defects / Returns8.1 The Buyer shall inspect the Goods on delivery and shall within forty-eight (48) hours of delivery notify the Seller of any alleged defect, shortage in quantity, damage or failure to comply with the description or quote. The Buyer shall afford the Seller an opportunity to inspect the Goods within a reasonable time following delivery if the Buyer believes the Goods are defective in any way. If the Buyer shall fail to comply with these provisions, the Goods shall be conclusively presumed to be in accordance with the terms and conditions and free from any defect or damage.8.2 Subject to clause 10.1, for Goods, which the Seller has agreed in writing that the Buyer is entitled to reject, the Seller will (at the Seller’s discretion) replace the Goods or repair the Goods (in accordance with clause 9.4) provided that:(a) the Buyer has complied with the provisions of clause 8.1;(b) the Goods are returned at the Buyer’s cost within seven (7) days of the delivery date by the Seller’s approved carrier;(c) a return authority number (RTA) has been issued by the Seller(d) the Seller will not be liable for Goods which have not been stored or used in a proper manner;(e) the Goods are returned in the condition in which they were delivered and with all packaging material, brochures and instruction material in as new condition as is reasonable possible in the circumstances.8.3 The Seller may (in its discretion) accept the Goods for credit but this may incur a handling fee of 10% of the value of the returned Goods plus any freight.9. Guarantees and Limitation of Liability9.1 Certain provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act (including, without limitation, the Australian Consumer Law) and other State, Territory or Commonwealth laws in Australia, as amended or replaced from time to time, (collectively ACL) apply to the operation of these terms and conditions and provide consumers (as that expression is used in the ACL) and others with certain rights (referred to collectively as the consumer guarantees) in relation to goods or services purchased by those persons.9.2 Other than consumer guarantees, which are not excluded, modified or restricted by this provision, the Seller does not give any guarantee or warranty or make any representation of any kind, express or implied, with respect to the supply by the Seller of any goods or services.9.3 The Seller guarantees that the Goods that are delivered by the Seller to the Buyer are of acceptable quality (as that expression is defined in the ACL) on delivery. The Seller may, at the Seller’s expense, repair any defects in Goods that are notified to Seller in writing by the Buyer in accordance with clauses 8.1 and 8.2.9.4 Other than in respect of goods or services supplied to consumers or goods or services that are of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, the Seller’s liability for the breach of any condition or warranty, whether express or implied (other than warranties or conditions in relation to title, encumbrances and quiet possession) is limited, at the Seller’s option, to:(a) in the case of goods; the replacement of the goods, the supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or(b) in the case of services; the supplying of the services again or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.9.5 Subject to rights that the Buyer may have under the ACL, which are not excluded, modified or restricted by this provision, the Seller is not liable to the Buyer or any other person, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for any loss or damages (including without limitation specific, indirect, consequential or economic loss) howsoever caused arising from any event.
10.
