NUCLEAR BLAST AMERICA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE NUCLEAR BLAST AMERICA SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE NUCLEAR BLAST AMERICA SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.

16. ARBITRATION
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Nuclear Blast America Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Nuclear Blast America or through store.nuclearblast.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered California agent: Michael D. Kuznetsky, Kuznetsky Law Group, P.C. 210 N. Pass Avenue Suite 103 Burbank, CA 91505.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
Likewise, Nuclear Blast America will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

17. NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA USERS
Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, users of the Nuclear Blast Services from California are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California 95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.
To top
18. APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE
By using any Nuclear Blast America Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable U.S. federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Nuclear Blast America.
Any suit, action, arbitration, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use or the Nuclear Blast America Services shall only be instituted in the County of Los Angeles, State of California. Each party waives any objection which it may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of such action or proceeding and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court or arbitrator in any such suit, action, arbitration, or proceeding.
