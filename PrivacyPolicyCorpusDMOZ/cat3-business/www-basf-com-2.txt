a. Data processing
We have integrated YouTube videos into our online offering, which are stored on the YouTube platform and can be played directly from our website. YouTube is a service of Google LLC, D/B/A YouTube. 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA (hereinafter as Google). The videos are all embedded in the so-called 2-click-mode, which means that no data about you as a user is being transferred to Google if you do not activate the video function. Before the video functions activation, only a preview image loaded from our own web server is being displayed.
Data will only be transferred to Google if you activate such video functions. Once being activated, we have no influence on this data transfer. The data transfer is carried out regardless of whether Google provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in at Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account.

In the course of the data transfer to Google, your personal data will be transferred to servers of Google, which might also be located in the USA. The USA is a country that does not have a level of data protection which is adequate to that of the EU. In particular, this means that personal data can be accessed by US authorities in a simplified manner and that there are only limited rights to such measures. If you activate the YouTube video function, you expressly consent to the transfer of data to Google and to the transfer of your personal data to servers located in the USA.
If you have given your consent, you have the right to revoke it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation.
You can revoke you consent at any time for the future by deactivating the slider of the category YouTube in the Cookie Settings.

There you will also find further information on your rights and setting options to protect your privacy.
Google may also process your personal information in the United States, a third country without an adequate level of data protection.
5. Social media hyperlink
We have included hyperlinks to the following social media services on our website: LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, YouTube, Slideshare, flickr and Instagram.
These hyperlinks are designed in the form of the corresponding logos and are stored on our own server.

The chatbot and the associated data processing will only be started if you have previously either clicked the "Accept All Cookies" button in the cookie banner or activated "Functional Cookies" and "Targeting Cookies" in the Privacy Preference Center. By default, "Anilina" is not loaded and therefore no personal data is collected from you.
Our chatbot supports you around the clock with general questions about applications and about BASF as an employer as well as with the search for suitable job offers as self-marketing. If the chatbot cannot answer your request, it will be passed on to the LiveChat from our BASF Talent Acquisition-Team.
The participation in a chat is voluntary and possible without registration via the BASF career website. You alone decide which personal data you disclose about yourself in the consulting chat. There is no need to tell us your name. The data provided by you will be processed exclusively for the purpose of carrying out the consultation and its quality assurance. Only data which is necessary to provide our consulting service or to handle your request will be used. This data will not be processed by besides anyone else than the service providers mentioned above and us.
The transfer of the data is encrypted. Technical and organizational security measures are used to protect the data from intentional or accidental manipulation, access by unauthorized persons, changes, loss and destruction.

Our legitimate interest in processing the data collected lies in the continuous improvement of our service within the framework of the chat.
c. Storage period
The chat record and its associated metadata will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for which it was stored ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the person responsible is subject. Data will also be deleted or made unavailable when a storage period prescribed by the above-mentioned provisions expires, unless there is a need to continue storing the data for the purpose of concluding or fulfilling a contract.
