However, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Transitions cannot and does not offer user legal, tax, or regulatory advice in the acquisition, merger, or sales process. User is advised to seek independent legal, tax, or other counsel for all aspects of the process and transaction, including any advice regarding the process, services, document, or forms.
User bears full and complete responsibility in the use of, or reliance on, information provided herein, including sample contract forms, suggested contract language, checklists, and service providers. TRANSITIONS CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT THE VALUE OR CONDITION OF THE BUSINESSES BEING PURCHASED, MERGED WITH, OR SOLD ON THIS SITE, THE REPRESENTATIONS OF EITHER BUYER OR SELLER, NOR THE RETENTION OF CLIENTS OR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING SALE, MERGER, OR ACQUISITION. All risk of loss or damage is solely that of the User. Transitions is not responsible for delays or interruptions related to this site or listings due to any act or cause not reasonably within Transitions' control. Listing fees are not refundable.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. ANY LIABILITY OF FP TRANSITIONS ARISING OUT OF ANY SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL OF (A) THE LISTING FEE FOR ONE YEAR AND (B) THE FEES PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL FP TRANSITIONS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE.
Liquidated Damages.
By using the FP Transitions Web site or by engaging Transitions for any services, User agrees to be bound by the following Terms of Use which are part of the Agreement. Transitions and its affiliates and subsidiaries reserve the right to review and revise the Terms of Use from time to time without notice and such updated Terms of Use shall be binding upon User.
User agrees to limit access to and use of listings and all articles, opinions, data charts, and comparable sales data to User’s personal and internal use, and shall not use listings, articles, opinions, data charts, and comparable sales data obtained from the Site for further distribution, publication, public display, or preparation of derivative works, or facilitate any of these activities in any way. User agrees that User will not use or reproduce listings obtained from this site, or from FP Transitions, for or in connection with any other listing service, or other service for which FP Transitions has been engaged by User. Users of the Site who violate these specific terms, by automated or manual means, shall be subject to immediate termination of their membership and will be assessed a fee of $500 per listing and per article per month in addition to any other damages that may be obtained pursuant to State or Federal law. User and Transitions agree that the damages to Transitions for a breach of the Agreement would be difficult to determine and that the amount of $500 is a reasonable estimate of the damages Transitions will incur as a result of User’s violation of this Agreement and is not a penalty. User agrees that its compliance with this Agreement is necessary and reasonable in order to protect Transitions and Transitions’ business. User further agrees that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Transitions for any breach by User of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, User agrees and acknowledges that any such violation or threatened violation will cause irreparable injury to Transitions and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available under this Agreement, in law, in equity or otherwise, Transitions shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement by User or the continuation of any such breach by User, without the necessity of proving actual damages.
Membership privileges are granted by Transitions to individuals exclusively and are granted specifically to the subscribing registered User only. Membership rights cannot be assigned, sublicensed, distributed, shared, viewed, accessed, or otherwise transferred to anyone other than the registered User without the express, written permission of Transitions. Transitions requires that each registered User maintain a valid e-mail address and password, which shall be required to log on to the FP Transitions system. Users are not permitted to share their individual log-in information with others. Transitions has the right to refuse or terminate service to any User that fails to abide by the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement or abuses their rights related to the Transitions service. In the event of a termination of a User’s service, there shall be no refund of membership fees.
Transitions utilizes e-mail as a vital and primary communication channel with User. As a registered User, User hereby acknowledges and grants Transitions permission to communicate with User via e-mail (as well as other communication channels, such as phone and fax) for any purpose, including, but not limited to, system messages and notices, Transition Flash notices, product updates, service announcements, and other marketing messages. Transitions will use best efforts to honor User's written request, if any, to opt out of marketing messages, but under no circumstances will Transitions have any liability for sending any e-mail to its registered Users or customers.
Transitions will, in its sole discretion and without notice, terminate the accounts of, and refuse service to, and without refund, any User who violates this Agreement. Additionally, Transitions shall have the sole authority to choose the manner in which any financial services business will be searched, displayed, accessed, downloaded, copied, and otherwise used or displayed on the Site, and Transitions shall have the right under this Agreement to modify all business listings.
User represents and warrants that (a) all information provided by User in User's listing or in discussions with prospective buyers or sellers or FP Transitions will be accurate; and (b) User agrees that User will not submit information regarding a financial services business on the FP Transitions' system under a name other than the named licensed business or individual. Transitions reserves the right to remove all or any part of a financial service business listing posted on this Web site. Transitions accepts no responsibility for checking the accuracy of reports, representations, or data files submitted by User as a listing customer or relied on by User as a prospective buyer.
Limitation of Remedies
User agrees that, to the full extent allowed by applicable law, TRANSITION’S LIABILITY, IF ANY, ARISING OUT OF ANY SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL OF (A) THE LISTING FEE FOR ONE YEAR (B) THE COMMISSIONS PAID BY USER THROUGH THE SITE ON THE APPLICABLE SELLER LISTING, OR (C) FEE PAID FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH USER ENGAGES FP TRANSITIONS, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE. IN NO EVENT SHALL TRANSITIONS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE. All use of the Transitions Site including, without limitation, all articles, process, services and documents shall be subject to this limitation on damages.
1) Security

2) User Warnings / User Conduct   Transitions currently makes certain services available, including, without limitation, listings of practices for sale, articles, a Web log system, and an instant notification service, conditioned upon User’s compliance with this Agreement.

14) Confidentiality
To communicate with any Seller on FP Transitions, User agrees to the following:
The User has or will request information from any prospective Seller ("Seller") of any practice listed on FP Transitions and located by User on the FP Transitions' site. As a condition to Seller's furnishing such information to User, Seller requires that User treat confidentially all information furnished in connection with this considered transaction (collectively the "Evaluation Material"), whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement. Seller also requires that User communicates solely through the FP Transitions website unless the Seller and FP Transitions explicitly requests otherwise. As used in this Agreement, the term Evaluation Material means: (1) proprietary information of Seller's businesses; (2) information marked or designated by Seller as confidential; (3) information, whether or not in written form and whether or not designated as confidential, which is known to either party as being treated as confidential; and (4) information provided to User by third parties which User is obligated to keep confidential. Evaluation Material includes, but is not limited to, client lists, marketing strategies, books and records, financial reports, client demographic reports or studies, client data, trade secrets, billing systems, seminar materials, teaching materials, brochures, techniques, models, data, programs, documentation, processes, know-how, marketing plans, and technical, software or programming information unique to Seller's business. In addition, User shall honor the confidentiality and privacy obligations set forth in both User's and Seller’s privacy statements.
User acknowledges that any disclosure of Evaluation Material will cause irreparable harm to the Seller/owner of the Evaluation Material.  Accordingly, User agrees not to disclose any Evaluation Material, directly or indirectly, under any circumstances or by any means, to any third person without the express written consent of the Seller/owner of the Evaluation Material. User agrees that he/she will not copy, transmit, reproduce, summarize, quote, or make any commercial or other use whatsoever of Evaluation Material, except as may be necessary to perform their due diligence.  Further, User agrees to exercise the highest degree of care in safeguarding Evaluation Material against loss, theft, or other inadvertent disclosure, and agrees generally to take all steps necessary to ensure the maintenance of confidentiality.
This Agreement shall not apply to any information now or hereafter voluntarily disseminated by Seller to the public, or which otherwise becomes part of the public domain through lawful means.  User agrees that upon termination of the due diligence process or the transaction contemplated herein, and upon request of the party owning or supplying the Evaluation Material, he/she will promptly return to the owner or supplier all Evaluation Material in whatever form, that may be in their possession or under their control.
User agrees that in the event User fails to abide by this Agreement, the Seller will be entitled to any and all remedies provided under the law.
User represents and warrants to FP Transitions that User has full authority to enter into this Agreement and to bind User and User's company to these terms.
The obligations on User as set forth in this Agreement will continue for as long as User is in possession of the Evaluation Material and for an additional period of 3 years from the date of this Agreement. User acknowledges that he/she has read and understood the terms of this Agreement, and has had an opportunity to consult with his/her own legal counsel.
