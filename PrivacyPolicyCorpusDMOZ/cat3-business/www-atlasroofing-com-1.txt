CONFIDENTIALITY &TRANSMISSIONS OVER THE INTERNET
The transmission of any data or information over the internet, through both private and publicly accessible networks may not be secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception and/or alteration while in transit. Accordingly, we do not assume any liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of transmissions over the internet (including those which may contain your personal information). We make no efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide us. In no event will the information you provide to us be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations to you on our part, or result in any liability to you on our part in the event that such information is inadvertently released by us or accessed by a third party without our consent.

INDEPENDENT ROOFING CONTRACTORS
Upon entering your information and the request for which you would like an independent roofing contractor (not affiliated with, associated with, or certified by Atlas in any way) to contact you, we do not guarantee that the independent roofing contractor will be able to obtain the materials for your roofing needs or that there are independent roofing contractors in your area that are either capable or willing to perform your roofing needs. We make no guarantees or representations regarding the skills or representations of such independent roofing contractors, or the quality of the job they may perform for you if you elect to retain their services. Atlas does not endorse or recommend the workmanship of any independent roofing contractor. It is entirely up to you to enter into a direct contract or otherwise reach agreement with an independent roofing contractor, and we do not guarantee or warrant specific job performance, the outcome or quality of the workmanship performed, nor any action they take while on the job. Independent roofing contractors are neither employees or agents of Atlas, nor is Atlas an agent of any independent roofing contractor. Atlas does not receive any remuneration from independent roofing contractors listed on the Atlas Websites. Atlas does not perform, and is not responsible for, any of the workmanship requested by you in your information request. Your rights under contracts you enter into with independent roofing contractors are governed by the terms of such contracts and by applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws.

ATLAS PRO™ PROGRAM
Atlas currently provides a voluntary service and marketing materials to independent roofing contractors at http://www.atlasroofing.com/pro. This service is open to professional contractors with a desire to sell and promote the Atlas brand and Atlas branded products.  The program does not convey permission from Atlas to represent yourself or your company as being affiliated with, recommended by, or certified by Atlas.  Atlas reserves the right to terminate this program in its entirety, the right to discontinue or terminate any account, and you agree Atlas may do so at any time with or without justification and without any liability or recourse whatsoever.
When you sign up for this or any other Atlas affiliated program (e.g. marketing kits, lead generation, promotional coupons), Atlas is not issuing a specific referral, recommendation, testimonial or approval of any independent roofing contractor. Additionally, Atlas does not require certification, validation or proof of proper business practices to create an account. It is the responsibility of the Homeowner and/or Property Owner to determine the qualification of any potential independent roofing contractor inquiring about performing work on any potential project.
MISCELLANEOUS
The failure of Atlas to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of ATLAS WEBSITES or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the Terms and Conditions herein are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
