A practice that we determine to be highly unethical is taking place in the mortgage industry today. When you ask to have your credit pulled by a mortgage company of your choice the credit bureaus may then sell your name and personal information, including your phone number to as many mortgage companies who will pay them for your information. You then may get inundated with phone calls and mail by companies who have invaded your privacy.
The mortgage companies that treat your private information in this fashion call this type of practice “trigger leads”. With this practice you can not be sure who your information is being sold to and for what purpose.
To protect yourself from the credit bureaus selling your private and highly personal information to unknown people please visit:

The above website offers you the opportunity to withdraw your name and personal information from the list the credit bureaus will sell to any and all bidders. For more questions contact us today or send an email to info@lendtx.com.
