Unless you provide it to us voluntarily or the information is collected via cookies in the manner described in this notice, Iron Mountain does not collect Personal Information in connection with your use of this Web site.

Iron Mountain may, from time to time, share your Personal Information with marketing consultants, in which case, the consultants shall be prohibited from using your Personal Information except with respect to assisting Iron Mountain in the sale of its services and products, and the consultants shall also be required to comply with the terms of this notice.
How we use cookies and other technologies.
General - When you visit this site, information about your browser type, operating system, IP address, and the domain name from which you access this site (e.g., yahoo.com) is collected. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the number of times you have visited the site, the date you visited the site, and the amount of time you spent viewing the site. In addition, Iron Mountain may track your response to Iron Mountain's advertisements, e-mails and site content, determine your ability to receive HTML-based e-mail messages, learn how many users open an e-mail and allow our service providers to compile aggregated statistics about an e-mail campaign for Iron Mountain. This information is used solely for our internal purposes in managing the site and improving its functionality, as well as to assist us in better targeting interactive advertising, thereby enhancing customer support and site usability. The collection of such information, whether by us or by data aggregators, is subject to the terms set forth in this notice.
Transparent GIF Files - In addition to our own cookies, we use pixels, or transparent GIF files, on our sites to help manage our online advertising and e-mail marketing. These GIF files are provided by one or more third-party service providers, based on our specification as to where they are used. The files enable our service providers to recognize a unique cookie in your Web browser, which, in turn, enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and e-mails bring you to our website and how you use the site.
Examples of the ways in which Iron Mountain and our third-party service providers use GIF files include:
Tracking customer response to our advertisements, e-mails and site content.
Determining your ability to receive HTML-based e-mail messages. This capability helps us or our service providers send you e-mail in a format you can read.
Knowing how many users open an e-mail, thereby enabling our service providers to compile aggregate statistics about an e-mail campaign for us.
Allowing us to better target interactive advertising; enhancing customer support and site usability; and providing offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you, if you have given us permission to do so by opting-in to receive them.
To conduct these or other activities, we or our service providers sometimes may link Personal Information you previously provided us (such as, for example, your name and e-mail address) to the information the GIF files provide about how you arrive at, navigate through and leave our sites.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Crozier and the Website do not recognize DNT.
The information we disclose.
Subject to applicable law, we and our service providers (as defined below) disclose and share your personal information:
Among Iron Mountain and its Affiliates;
To unaffiliated third parties that are under contract to perform services for or on behalf of Iron Mountain (Service Providers), and are required to uphold and maintain policies with respect to privacy and the treatment of your Personal Information (e.g., vendors hosting the investor relations, Iron Mountain Fulfillment Services, Iron Mountain Digital Services, or Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management aspects of this web site or other vendors providing services of the nature referred to in this notice);
To a third party in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or division; and
To other persons as permitted or required by applicable law or regulation.
For credit card payments, we employ third parties to process these payments on our behalf. These third-party credit card processing parties will only have access to the personal information which you provide directly to them when you make a credit card payment. They are required under their contract with Iron Mountain to process this personal information securely and in accordance with the relevant privacy or data protection laws.
Any access to such information will be limited to the purposes for which such information was provided to us or our Service Providers. Iron Mountain, its Affiliates and Service Providers are located throughout the world. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be sent to countries which have a different level of privacy protection than the United States of America (USA) or your country of residence.

Iron Mountain will, at your request, provide you with details of companies and countries to which your information has been sent. Iron Mountain does not and will not sell your personal information.
