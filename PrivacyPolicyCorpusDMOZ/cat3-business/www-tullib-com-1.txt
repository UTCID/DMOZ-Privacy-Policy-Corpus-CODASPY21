Our contact information
Personal Information that we collect from you
When you engage with us (e.g. sending us emails, contacting us via telephone, or
visiting or making an enquiry through the Website) you may provide Personal Information
about yourself including your name and contact details e.g. your address, email
address, and telephone number. If you are using our services, you may also provide
us with your financial information and various other necessary Personal Information.
Where you make use of the Website we may also collect information about your use
of the Website (e.g. your IP address and choice of web browser). Some of this Personal
Information is collected and processed so we can perform a contract with you, some
for the purpose of compliance with applicable legislation and some for the purposes
of our legitimate business interests (namely to carry out and improve our business,
analyse the use of the Website and services and support our staff and clients).
In order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations we record calls made
on certain employees' landlines and mobile telephone lines.
Where you apply for a job with us, we may collect from you and third parties, where
relevant, additional Personal Information such as your CV and any references. Unless
you agree that we can keep such information on file for future opportunities or
we need to retain such information for compliance with our legal obligations, in
the event that you are unsuccessful, we will only retain this Personal Information
for as long as is reasonably necessary to process your application.
Where you provide Personal Information on behalf of another individual you are responsible
for notifying that individual that you have provided their Personal Information
to us and directing them to this Policy so they can see how we will process their
Personal Information.
Personal Information that we receive from other sources
We may receive information from third parties who collect Personal Information from
you and pass it on to us. For example: (i) in connection with services that we provide
to our clients; and (ii) we may receive information from past employers and others
concerning your employment history where you apply for a job with us. Where this
is the case the third party is responsible for informing you that they have shared
your Personal Information with us, directing you to this Policy and obtaining any
relevant consents from you to ensure you are happy with the ways in which your Personal
Information will be used. However, once we are holding it, we will only handle any
person's Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.
Sensitive Personal Information
"Sensitive Personal Information" is Personal Information concerning
an individual's: (i) racial or ethnic origin, (ii) political opinions, (iii) religious
beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, (iv) membership of a trade union,
(v) physical or mental health or condition, (vi) sexual life or orientation, (vii)
commission or alleged commission of any offence or any proceedings for any offence
committed or alleged to have been committed by him/her, the disposal of such proceedings,
or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.
Where we receive Sensitive Personal Information we will only keep such information
for as long as strictly necessary in order to comply with our obligations under
the law.
What we do with your Personal Information
We will only use your Personal Information in order to: (a) provide you with our
services on an ongoing basis, in accordance with our contract, (b) improve our Website
and services, (c) comply with our own legal and regulatory obligations, including
in relation to financial promotion, applicable anti-money laundering and counter
terrorist financial legislation (d) for our internal business processes, including
providing support to our staff and (e) where relevant, process your application
for employment.
Where you have explicitly consented at the time we collected your Personal Information
or where we otherwise have a right to do so, we may also use your Personal Information
to let you know about any of our services that may be of interest to you and/or
inform you about important changes or developments to our services by email.
Where you or your employer (or any other entity you work for) provides services
to us, you and/or they may provide us with some of your Personal Information in
connection with the provision of the services, such as your name, business contact
details and other Personal Information. We will only process such Personal Information
in connection with the provision of the services (such as using your contact details
to discuss the services) and in accordance with this Policy. In addition, where
necessary, we may also share your Personal Information with third parties in order
to provide our services.
If you change your mind about us using your Personal Information in the ways described
in this Policy, please let us know by contacting the Chairman of the data privacy
forum at GDPRqueries@tpicap.com. You
may also opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the instructions
outlined in the email.
How we share your Personal Information
Where it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or for our internal
business processes, we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties,
professional advisors, service providers, regulatory bodies, auditors, technology
providers, and any duly authorised agents or related, associated, or affiliated
companies of the foregoing for the same purposes.
By submitting your Personal Information to us, you acknowledge that such third parties
may receive and process your Personal Information. We ask all third parties to treat
your Personal Information securely and in accordance with this Policy and will take
reasonable steps to enforce this.
In addition, it may be necessary to disclose your Personal Information if we are
under a duty to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal
obligation (such as anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist financing obligations),
carry out an internal investigation, enforce our Terms and Conditions on our Website
and any other agreement, or protect the rights, property, or safety, of our companies
and our clients, directors, employees, or other personnel. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection
and prevention. They in turn may exchange information (including Personal Information
and financial information) with foreign tax authorities.
In exceptional circumstances, if we are sold or merged with another company we may
disclose your information to a potential buyer, including your Personal Information
and other information concerning your relationship with us, so that they can continue
to provide the services you have requested.
Our security measures and information about when we delete data
We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as we reasonably require
and, in any event, only for as long as the Data Protection Legislation allows.
Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the
Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you
not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
secure and, although we will take steps to protect your Personal Information, we
cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information when transmitted via
the Website; any transmission is therefore at your own risk.
Some of our premises use CCTV, however, this is under the control of third parties
and therefore you should consult any notices they display and their privacy statements
for more information.
Transferring Personal Information outside of the EEA
Any Personal Information provided to us may be transferred to and stored on third
parties’ servers. We take steps to protect your Personal Information from unauthorised
access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, and damage.
In processing your Personal Information, it will sometimes be necessary for us to
transfer your Personal Information outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") to
our staff and our third-party service providers. It may also be accessed by staff
operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers or group companies.
This includes people engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services
to us. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal
Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy and the Data
Protection Legislation when it is processed in, or otherwise accessed from, a location
outside the EEA. This means that we will only transfer your Personal Information
to our non-European offices and Funds, and to third parties based outside the EEA
if that party: (a) is situated in a country that has been confirmed by the European
Commission to provide adequate protection to Personal Information, (b) has agreed
(by way of written contract incorporating the "model clauses" as approved by the
European Commission or by some other form of data transfer mechanism approved by
the European Commission) to provide all protections to your Personal Information
as required by the Data Protection Legislation, or (c) we have your explicit consent
to do so (such as where you have requested a service from one of our Funds situated
outside the EEA). Where any transfer takes place under a written contract, you have
the right to request a copy of that contract and may do so by contacting the Chairman
of the Privacy Forum at GDPRqueries@tpicap.com.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the UK is no longer a part of the
EEA, references in this paragraph to the EEA shall mean the EEA and the UK.
By submitting your Personal Information to us, you acknowledge this transferring,
storing, or processing of your Personal Information.
Accessing and updating your Personal Information
You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Information for marketing
or research purposes. If you have given us your express consent, or where we otherwise
have the right to do so, we may use your Personal Information for marketing purposes.
If we intend to disclose your Personal Information to any third party for marketing
purposes, we will seek your explicit consent prior to any such transfer. You can
exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the
forms we use to collect your Personal Information.
You are entitled to know details about the Personal Information we hold about you
and how that information is processed. If you would like to request this, please
contact the Chairman of the Privacy Forum at
GDPRqueries@tpicap.com and we will provide you with the information to which
you are entitled.
You can also ask us to: (a) make any changes to ensure that any Personal Information
we hold about you is accurate and up to date; (b) erase or stop processing any Personal
Information we hold about you where there is no longer a legal ground for us to
hold it; or (c) in some circumstances, transfer any information we hold about you
to a specified third party. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please
contact us at Chairman of the Privacy Forum at
GDPRqueries@tpicap.com.

Should you have any queries or complaints in relation to how we use your Personal
Information, please contact the Chairman of the Privacy Forum at
GDPRqueries@tpicap.com should you wish to take any complaints or queries
further, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office regarding
such issues.
