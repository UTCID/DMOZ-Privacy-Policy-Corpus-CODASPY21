We also produce and distribute bottles of various sizes and shapes through our PolyCycle SolutionsTM brand. DS Services of America, Inc., its brands and affiliates are collectively referred to in these Terms of Use as "DS Services", "we", "us" or "our".
These Terms of Use are important and affect your legal rights, so please read them carefully.
1.   Acceptance of Terms of Use
By accessing and using our websites and mobile applications that link to these Terms of Use (collectively, our "Sites"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.
If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, you may not access our Sites or order, receive or use the products and services made available through the Sites.
These Terms of Use do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with us in respect of any products, services or otherwise. If you are using the Sites on behalf of any person or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such person or entity's behalf and that such person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or such person or entity violates these Terms.
We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms of Use at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of these Terms of Use. By continuing to access or use the Sites, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use. We encourage you to review the Terms of Use frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Sites.
2.   Privacy Policy
Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.
3.   Eligibility
The Sites are not targeted toward or intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. By using the Sites, you represent and warrant that you (a) are 18 years of age or older, (b) are a legal resident of the United States, (c) have not been previously suspended or removed from the Sites, or engaged in any activity that could result in suspension or removal from the Sites, and (d) have full power and authority to enter into these Terms of Use and in so doing will not violate any other agreement to which you are a party.
4.   Registration, Account and Communication Preferences
In order to access and use certain areas or features of the Sites, you will need to register for an account. By creating an account, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete account information, (b) maintain and promptly update, as necessary, your account information, (c) maintain the security of your account credentials, (d) be responsible for the acts or omissions of any third party who has authority to access or use the Sites on your behalf, and (e) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Sites or your account.
By creating an account with us, you also consent to receive electronic communications from us (e.g., via email or by posting notices to the Sites). These communications may include notices about your account (e.g., payment authorizations, password changes and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that such communications be in writing.
5.   Online Payments
By accessing, viewing or using our online payment service, you authorize us to establish and maintain your invoices and payment authorizations and process your payments according to your instructions.
You also represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method.
DS Services reserves the right to terminate your access to the online payment service at any time with or without cause or prior notice in our sole discretion. When you send DS Services a payment authorization, you authorize DS Services to charge your transaction account and remit funds on your behalf.
DS Services anticipates completing most transactions and posting your payment within two (2) business days of the date you designate. Due to circumstances beyond the control of DS Services, some transactions may take more than two (2) business days to post. Therefore, DS Services should receive payment authorizations at least three (3) business days before the actual payment due date. If you send a payment authorization less than three (3) business days before the payment due date, you may be assessed late charges and penalties by DS Services if your payment does not post prior to the due date.
If your financial institution or the holder of the account from which you have designated payment is unable to complete your transaction including, but not limited to, insufficient funds, the transaction may not be completed, and DS Services may charge you for any returned credit/debit card charges.
DS Services does not charge you any additional fees for submitting online payments; however, you may incur charges from your financial institution to make these payments.

We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites (or any features or parts thereof) at any time.
17.   Dispute Resolution; Arbitration
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH DS SERVICES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
a.   Binding Arbitration
You and DS Services each agree to waive our respective rights to have any and all disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") arising from or related to these Terms of Use, the Sites or the Content, resolved in a court and by a jury trial.
Instead, you and DS Services agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration as provided in more detail in these Terms of Use.
The foregoing waivers shall not apply to any Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 11 or Disputes in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.
b.   No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions
You and DS Services agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the Sites or the Content is personal to you and DS Services and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and DS Services agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and DS Services agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
c.   Federal Arbitration Act
You and DS Services agree that these Terms of Use affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
d.   Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution
You and DS Services agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to DS Services shall be sent by certified mail or courier to DS Services of America, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway, Suite 500N, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, account number (if you have one) and an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking.
If you and DS Services cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or DS Services may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding.
e.   Process
EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO A VIOLATION OF SECTION 11 OR DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, LOGOS, TRADE SECRETS OR PATENTS, YOU AND DS SERVICES AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE MUST BE COMMENCED OR FILED BY YOU OR DS SERVICES WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE, OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND DS SERVICES WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). You and DS Services agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Cobb County, Georgia, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of Georgia and the United States, respectively, sitting in Cobb County (for state) and Fulton County (for federal), have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
f.   Authority of Arbitrator
As limited by the FAA, these Terms of Use and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms of Use. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
g.   Rules of JAMS
The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
h.   Opt-Out Right
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first visit the Sites (and thus accept these Terms of Use) by writing to: DS Services of America, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway, Suite 500N. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 18.
18.   Governing Law and Venue
These Terms of Use and your access to and use of the Sites shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Georgia or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration, shall be resolved in the states courts of Cobb County, Georgia or the federal courts of Fulton County, Georgia.
19.   Governing Law and Venue
Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Sites at any time and for any or no reason.
20.   Severability
If any term, clause or provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms of Use.
21.   Miscellaneous
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and DS Services relating to your access to and use of the Sites. These Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of DS Services. No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and DS Services' failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms of Use are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
