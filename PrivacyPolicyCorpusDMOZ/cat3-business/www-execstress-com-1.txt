Attention those in the EU
While the majority of our business is done in Australia we recognise that there are occasions when potential clients will make contact or someone will purchase a service or product via our site.  The above link should help you to understand what we do with your contact information, if that has been collected. If you subscribe to a newsletter or our blog or podcast, only your name and email address are collected. Further contact details are only required should a purchase of our services take place.
Where applicable to the GDPR, the information above has been updated in line with the EU data protection law (including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”).
Confidentiality Policy
We respect the integrity of clients’ intellectual property and will not at any time disclose to any third party any client information. All electronic client material will be kept for a period of 6 months from date of completion, and then deleted from our system. Copies of electronic files can be made available upon request by the client within that 6-month period (cost involved). After this time, all client files will be erased in accordance with this Confidentiality Policy.
Payments Policy
Clients are invoiced at the end of the project (for one-off jobs) or monthly in arrears (for ongoing work). Invoices are provided in electronic format. Payment terms are strictly 14 days from the date of the invoice. A 10% per month late payment fee applies to overdue accounts.
Clients may purchase blocks of hours per calendar month to suit budgets but these are invoiced monthly in advance and unused hours do not roll over or accrue.
Preferred method of payment is direct credit to our nominated bank account. We also accept company cheques and cash. Credit card facilities are available for overseas clients only and a small administration charge applies, which will be added to your invoice. Overseas clients are requested to provide us with credit card details in advance. Payments can also be facilitated via PayPal or Payoneer.
Service Policy
eSOS strives to provide work within a 48 hour turn around time if the client does not specify a timeframe for delivery of work. Any work required before this period is subject to a “Rush Rate” of twice the applicable hourly rate. eSOS strives to provide error-free work. Typographical errors or mistakes which are clearly the fault of eSOS will be corrected at no charge. Client revisions will be charged at the applicable hourly rate.
