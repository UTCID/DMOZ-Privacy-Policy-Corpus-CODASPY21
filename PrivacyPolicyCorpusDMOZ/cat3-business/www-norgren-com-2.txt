Supply Chain ComplianceWe are committed to eliminating slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. In order to achieve that goal, we include as a part of our Supplier Selection Process a requirement that our suppliers certify that they comply with The IMI Way, our ethical code of conduct, and as such comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the countries in which they do business. In addition, our supply chain managers are trained to evaluate suppliers carefully to detect any non-compliance. In the event we discover any non-compliance by any supplier, we will not hesitate to cease doing business with that supplier.
