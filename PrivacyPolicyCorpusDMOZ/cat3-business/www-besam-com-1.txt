Sliding doors
Sliding doors offer single or bi-parting openings, through a variety of styles and configurations. Safe and easy to use, they are suitable for any entrance, from simple opening and closing to providing a hermetic seal.
Swing doors
Swing doors take up minimal space while providing maximal opening width. The operators are ideal for both new installations and retrofits, and manual opening is easy if needed for convenience or safety.
Revolving doors
Revolving doors are ideal when climate control is a priority. Available in two-, three- and four-wing models, they guide traffic flow while providing superior separation of indoor and outdoor environments.

As your dedicated partner for any entrance solution, we support you all the way – from design and installation to modernization and service – ensuring a seamless flow of people, goods and vehicles through your doors.

Our heritage
Besam was established in 1962 with the development of automatic doors for the healthcare sector. In 1970 the business expanded with sliding door solutions and in 1985 included a portfolio of revolving doors. As the need for automatic doors grew in industries like transportation and retail, Besam expanded to several markets worldwide.
Besam was acquired by ASSA ABLOY in 2002. Determined to set new standards in customer experience, ASSA ABLOY Entrance Systems gather all products and services under one brand. For you this means we have gathered the expertise and experience and still offer superior automatic pedestrian doors. To complement your automatic doors, we also offer a broad range of industrial-, commercial-, high-performance- and Megadoor vertical-lifting fabric doors, as well as loading dock equipment and service.
