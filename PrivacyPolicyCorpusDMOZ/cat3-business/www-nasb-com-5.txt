What you need to start the ball rolling for home ownership.
At NASB, we understand that looking for pre-approval on a home mortgage means you’re serious about buying a home. So we want to help prepare you for our pre-approval process by highlighting some important information to move forward.
Requirements for Loan Pre-Approval
There are several pieces of documentation NASB needs from every applicant seeking pre-approval. A few (but not all) examples are:
Proof of income – You’ll need the last two years of W2’s, tax returns and your most recent pay stubs.
Credit history – You are legally obligated to a free personal credit report from the major credit bureaus. Certain credit scores are needed to qualify for our lending services.
Employment verification – In addition to recent pay stubs, you’ll need to provide us with your employer’s information. We’ll verify your employment and income. Our lending products typically require at least two years of stable employment with the same employer.
You’ll need access to your government-issued ID and Social Security number to help verify the paperwork. Additionally, certain buyers may be required to provide additional documentation such as proof of assets and all information regarding secondary sources of income (alimony, self-employment income, etc.). These requirements are the same for all loan types, including VA loans, FHA loans and conventional loans. VA loan borrowers, however, are required to also provide a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).
Our lending experts will work with you to get your pre-approval information, but understand the document doesn’t guarantee access to any lending product. The pre-approval document is a great step toward buying your new home, but you’ll also need to be prepared for possible down payments and – depending on the loan – buying private mortgage insurance.
It’s also important to remember that our lending experts may need more documentation to help stamp your pre-approved documentation. Keep the lines of communication open to move as quickly as possible on pre-approval and your eventual loan application. We understand that time is of the essence when buying a home. NASB is here to assist with your unique mortgage situation.
