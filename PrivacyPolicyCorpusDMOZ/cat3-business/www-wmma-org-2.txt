WMMA collects personal information in order to deliver a superior level of customer service. In order to facilitate online transactions and allow user access to Members-Only features, WMMA collects certain information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, membership IDS, and credit card numbers. In addition, your personal information helps us to keep you posted on the latest meetings, products, and events that you might like to hear about.
The WMMA website requires you to provide personally identifiable information in order to use certain functions of the site. By providing such information, you consent to WMMA's collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Statement.
The information you provide may include information collected during the registration process, including contact information (name, address, phone number, e-mail address, dietary restrictions, website urls and titles) and financial information (credit card number). This information will be used to process your order and, if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your order.
We may provide limited personal information to the following trusted providers to enhance our membership services and for the benefit of our members:

WMMA understand the importance of minimizing the amount of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data it maintains and retains such date only as long as necessary. We maintain organizational record retention procedures, which dictate the length of date retention to meet business, legal and operational needs.
WMMA will not ask your permission to collect or use aggregate information about website visitors or users of our products and services, since aggregate data does not identify you as a specific individual.

To help us provide superior service, we may share personal information with credit card processing companies, merchants, and any other third party that may need the information for your request to be processed. These organizations have their own privacy and collection practices, and WMMA is not responsible for their independent policies. At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.
