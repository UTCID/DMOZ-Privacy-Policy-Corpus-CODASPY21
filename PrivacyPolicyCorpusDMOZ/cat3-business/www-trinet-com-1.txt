Violation of This Agreement
Violations of this Agreement may result in civil or criminal liability. TriNet reserves the right (but has no obligation) to investigate occurrences that may involve such violations and, in TriNet’s sole discretion, take appropriate action against you if you violate this Agreement. Such action may include, without limitation, refusing to provide you access to and use of the Site, reporting you to law enforcement authorities, and taking legal action against you.

You agree to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts in Alameda County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside.
Severability
If any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, then the void or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

Any waiver by TriNet of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Agreement. Any waiver must be in writing. Failure by TriNet to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive TriNet of the right to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
