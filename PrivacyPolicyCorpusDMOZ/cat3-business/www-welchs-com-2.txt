Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information

Right to Deletion
In certain circumstances, you have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Upon verifying your request, we will delete your personal information from our records, and instruct any service providers to delete your information, as directed by CCPA.

Calling us at 1-800-340-6870.
Visiting the “Contact Us” page of our Site www.welchs.com.
Only you or your authorized agent may make a request related to your personal information. You also may make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may make a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your request warrants a fee, we will let you know that and why, and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
