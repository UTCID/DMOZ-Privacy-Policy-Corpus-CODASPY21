CSR Group Privacy Policy
CSR Group Privacy Policy
CSR respects the privacy of
individuals. This policy outlines the way we manage personal information that
we collect or that is provided to us. It applies to CSR Limited and Australian
companies in the CSR group (CSR, we, us).
CSR is bound by the Australian
Privacy Principles (Principles) applicable to private sector organisations
under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). In summary, the Principles apply to 'personal
information' as information (or an opinion) relating to an individual that can
be used to identify that individual. CSR sometimes handles personal information
relying on exemptions under the Privacy Act, for example in relation to
employee records. Where there is any inconsistency, we may rely on those
exemptions despite what this privacy policy says.
Why does CSR collect personal information?
CSR is major manufacturer and
supplier of building materials and has a
substantial investment in aluminium smelting. We collect personal information
about people we deal with and others, where relevant, in order to operate our
businesses. As a publicly listed company, we also maintain records of our
shareholders. Collecting personal information is also necessary in some circumstances
to meet our legal obligations.
What kind of personal information does CSR collect and how does CSR
collect it?
CSR generally collects and holds
personal information about:
our employees;
contractors who provide services to CSR;
our customers;
our suppliers;
our shareholders;
job applicants; and
other people who may come into contact with CSR or one of CSR's
businesses.
The type of information we collect
varies, depending on the purpose, and may include (but is not limited to) your name,
address, contact details, organisation, identification, positions held, payment
details, credit information and marketing information.
This information may be obtained by
way of forms filled out, information provided in person or by telephone, email or
online by the individuals themselves, or from a public source or third party
(for example, referees, other CSR companies, your organisation, your representatives
and information service providers). For additional information about our
handling of personal information we collect through our web sites, please see
the Security and Privacy Statement on the relevant site.
How do we use personal information and to whom may we disclose it?
In general, CSR collects, uses and
discloses personal information to:
provide products or services that have been requested;
maintain relationships with suppliers, contractors and other parties;
communicate;
verify your identity and personal information;
maintain and update our records;
provide ongoing information and marketing communications about CSR
products and services to CSR customers and prospective customers by telephone,
email, online and other means as permitted by law, unless they opt out; and
comply with legal obligations and protect our lawful interests.
We may not be able to do these things
without your personal information. For example, we may not be able to respond
to your enquiries or provide you a product or service you have requested.
We may also collect, use and disclose
your personal information in connection with:
reasonable information requests from courts, government bodies and
lawyers
suspected fraud, misconduct and unlawful activity, and
any sale or potential sale of any part of our business.
CSR uses the personal information it
collects about CSR shareholders to fulfil its legal obligations and to keep its
shareholders informed of CSR’s progress. We are required or authorised to
collect shareholder personal information under certain laws including the
Taxation Administration Act and the Corporations Act, and we are also required
to make limited shareholder details available to members of the public on
request. CSR's share registry is managed by Computershare Investor Services Pty
Limited (Computershare). Computershare’s privacy policies are available via
www.computershare.com.au.
Depending on the product or service
concerned, personal information may be disclosed to:
other divisions or organisations within CSR;
service providers and specialist advisers to CSR who have been
contracted to provide CSR with administrative, archival, auditing, accounting,
customer contact, legal, business consulting, banking, payment, debt
collection, delivery, data processing, data analysis, information broking,
research, investigation, website, technology or other services;
insurers, credit providers, courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities
as agreed or authorised by law;
credit reporting or reference agencies or insurance investigators; or
a person authorised by an individual.
Some of the third parties described
above may be located in New Zealand and other countries. While those third
parties will often be subject to confidentiality or privacy obligations, they
may not always follow the particular requirements of the Privacy Act.
Generally, we require that
organisations outside CSR who handle or obtain personal information as service
providers to CSR acknowledge the confidentiality of this information and
undertake to comply with the Principles.
How do we handle credit-related personal information?
While we do not provide credit to
consumers, we sometimes handle personal information from credit reporting
bodies (CRBs) and certain other consumer credit-related personal information as
described below (Credit-Related Personal Information) in the context of
commercial credit arrangements. For example, information about an individual’s
consumer credit worthiness may be handled where we provide commercial credit
accounts to sole traders, or individuals such as directors provide personal
guarantees in relation to commercial credit accounts.
We may collect
and hold the following types of Credit-Related Personal Information, both in
relation to your arrangements with us and those with third parties such as
other credit providers:
name, sex, date of birth, driver’s licence number, employer and three
most recent addresses;
confirmation of previous information requests about you to CRBs made by
other credit providers and credit insurers;
details of previous credit applications, including the amount and type
of credit and credit limit;
details of current and previous credit arrangements, including credit
providers, start/end dates and certain terms and conditions;
permitted payment default information, including information about related
payment arrangements and subsequent repayment;
information about serious credit infringements (e.g. fraud);
information about adverse court judgments and insolvency;
publicly available information about your credit worthiness;
any credit score or credit risk assessment indicating a CRB’s, credit
provider's or our analysis of your eligibility for consumer credit; and
any other types of Credit-Related
Personal Information about you permitted under the Privacy Act.
We may disclose Credit-Related
Personal Information to CRBs to assist the CRBs to maintain information about
you to provide to other credit providers for credit assessments. We may collect
Credit-Related Personal Information from CRBs for purposes including, to the
extent permitted by law, to assess your application
for credit or to be a guarantor, manage your credit/guarantee, assign debts and
collect overdue payments. We may also exchange Credit-Related Personal
Information with debt buyers, credit insurers and other credit providers.
The CRBs we use
may include:
Dun & Bradstreet, Level 7, 479 St. Kilda Road Melbourne 3004,
www.dnb.com.au, pacaustral@dnb.com.au, 1300 734 806

Tasmanian Collection Service, 29 Argyle Street, Hobart,
www.tascol.com.au, enquiries@tascol.com.au, (03) 6213 5555
You have the right
to request CRBs not to:
use your Credit-Related Personal Information to determine your
eligibility to receive direct marketing from credit providers; and
use or disclose your Credit-Related
Personal Information, if you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud.
Please see other
sections of this Privacy Policy for further details about how we collect and
hold personal information, disclosures (including to other countries) of
personal information, and access, correction and complaint rights and procedures.
In some cases, we are subject to further obligations under the Privacy Act
regarding Credit-Related Personal Information, and this Privacy Policy is not
intended to limit or exclude those obligations. Additional privacy consents and
notifications may also apply for our credit-related services.
How do we manage personal information?
CSR trains its employees who handle
personal information to respect the confidentiality of that information and the
privacy of individuals.
How do we store personal information?
CSR is required by the Principles to
safeguard the security and privacy of your information, whether you interact
with us personally, by telephone, mail, over the internet or other electronic
medium. This includes an obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the
personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access,
modification or disclosure. The steps we take depend on the circumstances but
may include measures such as firewalls, passwords, encryption, locked filing
cabinets and building access restrictions.
We hold information in physical and
electronic records at our own premises and with the assistance of our service
providers. The Principles also require CSR not to store personal information
longer than necessary and to take reasonable steps to destroy that personal
information or remove details which may identify individuals.
How do we keep personal information accurate and up-to-date?
CSR takes reasonable steps to ensure
that the personal information it holds is accurate and up-to-date. We encourage
you to contact CSR as soon as possible in order to update any personal
information we hold about you. CSR contact details are set out below.
Can you check and update the personal information about you that is held
by us?
You may obtain access to or correct any
personal information which CSR holds about you, unless one of the exceptions in
the Principles applies.
To make a request to access or
correct information CSR holds about you, please contact CSR in writing at the
address set out below. CSR will require you to verify your identity and to
specify what information you require. We will provide reasons if we deny any
requests for access to or correction of personal information. CSR may charge a
fee to cover the cost of providing access including locating, retrieving,
reviewing and copying any material requested. Where we decide not to make a
requested correction to your personal information and you disagree, you may ask
us to make a note of your requested correction with the information.
What if you have a complaint?
If you consider that any action of
CSR breaches this privacy policy or the Australian Privacy Principles, you can
make a complaint. In the first instance, please direct your complaint to the
particular CSR business or activity concerned – they are likely to be in the
best position to deal with the matter quickly and effectively. Each CSR
business or activity has an officer appointed to handle complaints. If the
matter is not resolved to your satisfaction, please make contact with the
relevant privacy officer below. CSR takes your privacy seriously and endeavours
to respond promptly to complaints.
For information about privacy
generally, or if your concerns are not resolved to you satisfaction, you may
contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at www.oaic.gov.au and on 1300 363
992.
How do you contact us?
If the particular CSR business or
activity is unable to deal with a privacy complaint to your satisfaction,
please contact the CSR Building Products Privacy Officer or the CSR Property
Privacy Officer (as relevant)  by e-mail,
phone, facsimile or post as set out below:

operations and practices and the changing business environment. All personal
information held by CSR will be governed by CSR's most recent policy. If you
