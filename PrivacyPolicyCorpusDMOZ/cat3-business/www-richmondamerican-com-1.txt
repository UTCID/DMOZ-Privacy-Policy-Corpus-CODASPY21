At no time will we disclose your Social Security Number, driver’s license number or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health insurance or medical identification number, an account password, or security questions and answers in response to a Request to disclose specific pieces of Information.

Right to Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercises the consumer’s rights under applicable privacy laws. This includes denying goods or services to the consumer, charging different prices or rates, providing a different level or quality of goods or services, and/or suggesting the consumer will receive a different price or rate for, or a different level or quality of, goods or services. We may charge a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data.
Financial Incentives
