1. Content of online provisionThe author does not guarantee the timeliness, correctness, completeness or quality of the information given. Liability claims against the author relating to material or immaterial damage caused by the use or non-use of information given, or by the use of incorrect and incomplete information, is excluded in principle insofar as there is no proof of intentional or gross negligence on the side of the author. All offers are subject to confirmation and non-binding. The author expressly reserves the right to alter, amend or cancel part of the pages of the whole provision without special notification, or to discontinue publication temporarily or permanently.2. References and linksTIn the case of direct or indirect links to foreign Internet sites (links) which lie outside the author’s area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only apply in cases where the author has knowledge of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for him to prevent use in the event of unlawful content. The author expressly declares herewith that, at the time the link was established no illegal content was noticeable on the sites to be linked. The author has no influence whatsoever on present and future design, content or authorship of the linked/associated sites. He therefore distances himself herewith from all content of all linked/associated sites that have been changed after the link was established. This applies to all links and references established within his own Internet provision, as well as to foreign entries in visitors’ books, discussion forums and mailing lists set up by the author. Only the provider of the site to which reference was made, and not the site which simply refers to links in the respective publication, will be liable for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages arising from the use or non-use of such information given.3. Copyright and licence rightsIn all publications the author has tried to observe copyright of the graphics, audio documents, video sequences and texts used, to use graphics, audio documents, video sequences and texts produced by himself or to revert to unlicensed graphics, audio documents, video sequences and texts. All brands and trademarks that are named and, the case arising, protected by a third party within the Internet provision, are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable licence right and the right of possession of the respective owner. It cannot be inferred solely on the basis of mere naming that trademarks are not protected by the rights of third parties! Copyright for published objects produced by the author himself remains solely with the author of the sites. The copying or use of such graphics, audio documents, video sequences and text in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the express consent of the author.The Silk icon set is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License.4. Legal effectiveness of this exclusion of liabilityThis exclusion of liability is to be regarded as part of the Internet provision referred to on this site. Insofar as part or individual elements of the wording of this text does not comply, no longer complies, or does not completely comply with the legal situation, the remaining part of the document shall remain unaffected by this in terms of content and applicability.
