Privacy Policy
Privacy Notice to Our Customers
Madison Mutual Insurance Company will safeguard the confidentiality and security of information we gather about you in connection with the issuance of insurance coverage. This notice describes our privacy policy with respect to the collection, protection, and disclosure of such information.
Collection of Information
We collect and use information only for business purposes. These business purposes include our evaluation of your request for insurance coverage, the issuance of insurance policies, the administration of claims, and the processing of any other transactions that you request. Most of the information we gather comes directly from you on your application form. If we need to confirm any of the information you have provided to us, or if we need additional information, we may obtain such information from other insurers and/or consumer reporting agencies. Information collection will generally relate to your finances, employment, and transactions or claims with us or with other insurance companies.
Protection of Information
The information we have gathered about you will be maintained in a confidential manner. Our employees may access such information only when there is an appropriate business reason to do so, such as to issue a policy, send a premium notice or process an insurance claim. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information. These safeguards comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and each of our employees is trained with respect to these safeguards and required to comply with this privacy policy.
