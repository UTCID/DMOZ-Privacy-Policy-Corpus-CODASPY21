IOLTA
Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (IOLTAs) are accounts developed from a program mandated by the Vermont Supreme Court. It requires lawyers or law firms to establish pooled dividend-bearing accounts for client deposits. VSECU will send all dividends earned to the Vermont Bar Foundation (VBF). This money is used to support civil legal services and justice programs for those who are unable to afford such services.

Interest On Realtors Trust Accounts (IORTAs) are available for Realtors who are required by law to maintain a dividend-bearing account for client deposits and down payments on the purchase of a home. All dividends earned on IORTA accounts are sent to the Vermont Housing Finance Authority (VHFA). The VHFA uses this money to support grants that provide housing opportunities for individuals/families that are unable to afford such services.
