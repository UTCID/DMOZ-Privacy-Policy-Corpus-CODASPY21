2. Protecting Your Information
2.1 Terry Labs uses a secure server.The secure server software (SSL) encrypts ALL of the information you provide to us, including your name, address and phone number, before it is sent to us so that it cannot be read as it travels to us over the internet. Once we receive it, all of the customer information we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We do this by following these following steps:
2.1.1 Firewall – Terry Lab’s systems are protected 24 hours a day by a powerful firewall that blocks unauthorized entry. In order to gain access to authorized information, the Web browser you are using must know the proper protocol, or language.
2.1.2 Encryption – From the moment information leaves your computer to the time is enters our systems, all online access is encrypted.
We employ some of the strongest forms of encryption commercially available for use on the Web today. During any transfer of data, our 128-bit encryption turns your information into a coded sequence with billions of possible variations, making it nearly impossible for unwanted intruders to decipher.
2.13 Employee access – We limit employee access to customer information to those who have a business
reason to know this information.
2.2 Although we intend to take all reasonable steps to prevent the introduction of viruses and other destructive materials or hackers, we cannot and do not
