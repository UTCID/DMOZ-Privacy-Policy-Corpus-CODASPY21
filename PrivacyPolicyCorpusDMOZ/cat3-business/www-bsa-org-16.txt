1. COLLECTION AND USE
The categories of Personal Data we collect, which may be collected both on the Site and offline, and our uses of Personal Data depend on the context, as described below:
Site visitors: We collect the following information from Site visitors, including those who request further information about BSA and its services, to the extent they provide it to us: name, title, company, job responsibilities, phone number, mailing address, email address, and contact details (collectively, “Contact Data”), as well as information related to requests from Site visitors, including information or newsletter requests, subscriptions, downloads, and username/passwords used to access our Site (if necessary) (collectively, “Registration Data”). In addition to Personal Data provided by Site visitors, we may also collect the following information about the device used to access our Site: computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier (UDID), cookies and other data linked to a device, and data about usage of our Sites, (collectively, “Device Data”). Note, however, we do not consider Device Data to be Personal Data except where we link it to you as an individual or where applicable law provides otherwise. We use this data to facilitate our Site and its services, make our Sites more intuitive and easy to use, respond to inquiries and requests, provide our services, manage accounts, maintain business operations, maintain our contacts, provide relevant marketing and materials, protect the security of the Site and our systems, address compliance and legal obligations, and interact with Site visitors (collectively, “General Uses”).
Current and prospective members, and government, media and policy contacts: We may collect the Contact Data, Registration Data and Device Data related to contacts at current and prospective BSA member companies and about government, media and policy contacts. In addition, we may collect data about participation in trade shows, policy events, and conferences, as well as credentials and associations of such individuals from both online and offline sources, including from the individuals directly. To the extent a transaction or reimbursement is involved, we may also collect necessary information for payments (e.g., credit card information, bank account information, personal identity card information) (“Payment Data”). In addition to the General Uses, we use this data to promote BSA membership, service existing BSA members, process membership, provide access to BSA resources, host and sponsor events, disseminate materials related to our advocacy, to advance our advocacy with such contacts, provide invitations to and facilitate events, and interact with current and prospective members, and government, media and policy contacts.
Job applicants: We may also collect data provided by job applicants or others on our Sites and/or via offline means in connection with employment opportunities, including Contact Data, Registration Data, Device Data. Information provided by job applicants may include information about applicants' education, training, diplomas, professional certifications, non-profit experience, employment background, functional experience, leadership experience, honors or awards, and job change data. We may also collect certain background check information, including government identification numbers, criminal background, associated companies, and other information (all to the extent permitted under applicable law) from the individual and from third parties (“Background Check Information”). We use this information to consider individuals for employment and contractor opportunities, address compliance and legal obligations, and manage on-boarding procedures.
Software Copyright Infringement Reporting Contacts: We collect Contact Data and Registration Data from individuals where they provide it in the context of their reporting of alleged instances of noncompliance with the intellectual property rights of our members. In addition to the General Uses, we use this data to facilitate and manage our compliance and enforcement activities, including identifying noncompliance, defending BSA's and our members' rights, pursuing available remedies on behalf of our members and BSA, and reporting to enforcement authorities (collectively, “Enforcement Uses”).

We may also collect online identifiers and associated content of such contacts (e.g., username/screen name). We use this data for General Uses and Compliance Marketing Uses.
We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning individuals (e.g., not offering an employment opportunity) or that otherwise significantly affects individuals.
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Data.
