Where this occurs you will be responsible for paying for the tonnage of fertiliser or other product actually applied, not the tonnage you anticipate based on any farm maps in your Account.15.3 [All base maps] used in My Ravensdown have been provided by Terralink/Creative Commons (for New Zealand maps) or Bing (for Australian maps), and accordingly Ravensdown has no responsibility for any errors or inaccuracies in any maps used in My Ravensdown.16 HazardsDespite any assistance we provide in relation to the farm maps in your Account, we are not responsible for the identification of any hazards situated on your farm.
