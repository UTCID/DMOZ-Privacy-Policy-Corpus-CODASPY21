Last Updated: October 26, 2018
Thank you for visiting our website terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions"). The Terms and Conditions govern your use of www.99restaurants.com and any of our associated websites that link to the Terms and Conditions (each, a "Website"), the services and resources enabled therein (each a "Service" and collectively, the "Services"), and each of our branded applications that include links to these Terms and Conditions (each an "Application," and together with the Website and Services, the "Properties"). These Terms and Conditions are a legal agreement between you and 99 Restaurants, LLC, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Ninety Nine”).
PLEASE READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PROPERTIES AND/OR BROWSING A WEBSITE OR DOWNLOADING AN APPLICATION, YOU REPRESENT THAT (1) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, (2) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH NINETY NINE, AND (3) YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PROPERTIES.
NINETY NINE CAN CHANGE, MODIFY OR ADD OR REMOVE PROVISIONS OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AT ANY TIME BY POSTING A CHANGE NOTICE OR UPDATED TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE WEBSITE OR APPLICATION. IF ANY CHANGE, MODIFICATION, ADDITIONAL PROVISION OR REMOVAL OF A PROVISION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU MUST CEASE USING THE PROPERTIES. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE PROPERTIES WILL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED TO INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE. PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE OR APPLICATION TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
Use of the Properties
Placing Orders. You can place orders online for pickup from Ninety Nine stores through the online ordering system operated by olo.com. You can place these orders either as a guest or through an online account that you can create. To create an account, you must provide your first and last name, email address and a proposed password. Once your account is established, you can use that account to place orders. Please note that information you provide when setting up and using your account will be provided to Ninety Nine, olo.com, and potentially other third party service providers, such as Punchh, Inc., and will also be subject to olo.com’s User Agreement and Privacy Policy, which is available for viewing on the online ordering page, and potentially Punchh’s Privacy Policy, which is available at: https://punchh.com/privacy_policy.
Loyalty and Rewards Programs. We may work with third parties, such as Punchh Inc., to assist us in connection with our loyalty and rewards programs on our Properties. If you join a loyalty or rewards program, you may be able to use your account to access certain information and earn rewards and special offers. As part of these programs, certain account information may be shared with Punchh or other third party service providers (including, without limitation, your name, email address, payment information and information regarding the purchases you make with us).
License. The Properties are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to your compliance with the Terms and Conditions, Ninety Nine grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use, and in the case of an Application to download, install and use a copy of the Application on a mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application, solely for your own personal, non-commercial purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple iTunes App Store (an "App Store Sourced Application"), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the "Usage Rules" set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
Updates. You understand that the Properties are evolving. As a result, Ninety Nine may require you to accept updates to the Application that you have installed on your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that Ninety Nine reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Properties from time to time, with or without notice. You may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to use or access the Properties.
Privacy Policy. Your use of the Properties is also governed by the Ninety Nine Privacy Policy, which is available at: https://www.99restaurants.com/privacy-policy (the “Privacy Policy”). You agree that we may use your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
Limitations on Your Use of Properties.
The rights granted to you in the Terms and Conditions are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you may not attempt, or authorize, encourage, or support others' attempts, to circumvent, reverse engineer, decrypt, break or otherwise alter or interfere with the Properties; (b) you may not copy, distribute, sell, resell, or exploit for any commercial purposes any portion of the Properties, or any products accessible through the Services; (c) you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes, including, without limitation, spiders, robots, scrapers, data mining tools, and the like, to "scape" or download data from any web pages contained in the Website; (d) you shall not access the Properties to build a competing or similar website, application or service; (e) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Properties may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; and (f) you shall not access or use the Properties in any way that violates applicable law. Any future release, update or other addition to the Properties shall be subject to the Terms and Conditions. Ninety Nine reserves all rights not granted in the Terms and Conditions. Any unauthorized use of the Properties terminates the licenses granted by Ninety Nine hereunder.
Termination.
If you breach the Terms and Conditions, Ninety Nine may suspend or terminate your ability to use the Properties immediately, with or without notice to you, in all instances in addition to any remedies otherwise available to it at law or in equity. If you want to terminate the Terms and Conditions, you may do so by (a) ceasing all use of the Properties and (b) closing any applicable account for all Services that you use. Upon termination of the Terms and Conditions, your right to use the Properties automatically terminates. Ninety Nine will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination. All provisions of the Terms and Conditions, which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of the Terms and Conditions, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability.
Disclaimer of Warranties.
YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NINETY NINE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NINETY NINE MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE PROPERTIES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE PROPERTIES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR FREE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY PRODUCTS YOU OBTAIN THROUGH USE OF THE PROPERTIES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND NINETY NINE MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING ANY DEALINGS WITH OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH ANY OTHER PARTIES THROUGH THE PROPERTIES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM NINETY NINE OR THROUGH THE PROPERTIES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.
Limitation of Liability.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NINETY NINE OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, FRANCHISEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE PROPERTIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS PARAGRAPH REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THAT THE PARTIES WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF NINETY NINE TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE PROPERTIES, EXCEED TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.
