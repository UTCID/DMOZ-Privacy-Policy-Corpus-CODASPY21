MOTOR INDUSTRY CODE OF PRACTICE FOR NEW CARS
Vauxhall Motors Limited subscribes to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute-approved Motor Industry Code of Practice for New Cars. As such, we are confirming promises made in the provision of new cars and the cover provided by our manufacturer’s warranty. This consumer code sets out standards with which we comply regarding:
Advertising
New Cars sales
Car Manufacturer’s Warranties
Availability of replacement parts
Complaints Handling
Complaints handling
We have a complaint handling procedure that you can use to try and resolve any dispute. We’ll do our best to get it resolved quickly and efficiently.
If you’re not satisfied following the conclusion of Vauxhall’s complaint handling procedure, it’s recommended that you contact The Motor Ombudsman (“TMO”) who is a certified alternative dispute resolution provider.
And if we’re found to be in breach of The Motor Industry Code of Practice for New Cars, TMO offers a free Adjudication Service to help resolve the dispute and where necessary an Ombudsman will give a final decision which is binding on both parties if you chose to accept it.
We’re fully committed to engage in the TMO procedures in order to try to resolve any dispute through alternative dispute resolution.
You can find further information about the TMO procedures through The Motor Ombudsman website at www.themotorombudsman.org. Alternatively, you can contact The Motor Ombudsman Information Line on 0345 2413008.
