Privacy Policy
Read Time: 1 min
For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply and any undefined terms have the meaning ascribed to them in the context in which they are used in this Agreement:
A. Personally-Identifiable Information:
Indiafin typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally-identifiable information to Indiafin through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want Indiafin to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that Indiafin not use your information by sending an e-mail to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it., however, Indiafin reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your Indiafin services. Absent any instructions from you, Indiafin may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the Indiafin family of companies, Indiafin venture companies, Indiafin authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom Indiafin has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. Indiafin will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those Indiafin sites where you may provide Indiafin with credit card or other ordering information via the web, Indiafin protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web-based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, Indiafin will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, Media Temple assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.
B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:
In general, Indiafin gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the Indiafin sites visited. Indiafin gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about Indiafin services). Indiafin does not combine information collected in this way with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it; this may however reduce functionality of certain website features such as the order system and the AccountCenter.
C. Your Indiafin hosted website, server, bulletin boards, forum, Third-Party Sites:
Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any blog, bulletin board, chat room, or website Indiafin may host for you as part of your Indiafin services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. Indiafin cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations. Additionally, Indiafin websites contain links to sites that belong to third parties unrelated to Indiafin. Indiafin cannot protect any information you may disclose in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit.
D. Exceptions and Limitations:
Notwithstanding the foregoing and in compliance with applicable laws, Indiafin (i) cooperates fully with state, local, and federal officials in any investigation relating to any content (including personal or private electronic communications transmitted to Indiafin) or purported unlawful activities of any user of the Service, and (ii) takes reasonable measures to protect its proprietary rights. For the limited purposes of accomplishing such cooperation and measures and in compliance with applicable laws, Indiafin may be required to disclose personally identifiable information. In addition, Indiafin may elect to monitor the areas of communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate Indiafin; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of Indiafin or others. In connection with the potential sale or transfer of any of its interest in indiafin.com and other sites owned by the company, Indiafin reserves the right to sell or transfer your information (including , but not limited to name, address information, and other information you provided to Indiafin) to a third party that (i) concentrates its business in communication products or services; (ii) agrees to be Indiafin's successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by Indiafin; and (iii) agrees to the obligations of this policy statement.
