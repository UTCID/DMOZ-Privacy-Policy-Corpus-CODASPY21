11.   Delivery
11.1   You can find details regarding our delivery charges under section 10. ‘Delivery Charges and Lead Times’.
11.2   Please note that our 'Checkout' is only able to process orders to addresses within the United Kingdom, with exception to the following locations: Isle of Wight, Isle of Man, Scottish Highlands, Scottish Isles, Northern Ireland & Channel Isles.
11.3   We will deliver the goods to the address you specify for delivery in your order. It is important that this address is accurate. Please be precise about where you would like the goods left if you are out when we deliver. We cannot accept any liability for any loss or damage to the goods once they have been delivered in accordance with your delivery instructions (unless this is caused by our negligence). We will aim to deliver the goods by the date quoted for delivery but delivery times are not guaranteed. If delivery is delayed due to any cause beyond our reasonable control, the delivery date will be extended by a reasonable period and we will contact you to arrange an alternative time.
11.4   If you are not at home to accept delivery, you will receive a failed delivery notice. You will then have 3-days in which to, contact the courier to arrange an alternative delivery day. After 3-days goods will be returned to our premises. If goods are still required the original delivery charge will be reapplied to your order, this charge also applies to goods that are redirected to a new address while in the hands of the courier.
11.5   You will become the owner of the goods you have ordered when they have been delivered to you. Once goods have been delivered to you they will be held at your own risk and we will not be liable for their loss or destruction.
12.   Checking your goods
12.1   Upon receipt of goods please examine them thoroughly, if possible in a clean dry place, ensuring that they are the goods that you ordered, that they are free from defects, in good working order and that there are no missing parts or items. Should you encounter any problems, please contact us as soon as possible either by telephone or email.
12.2   Please check your delivery for missing items or damaged goods before you sign for them. If a driver refuses to wait while you do so, please make a record on the driver’s documentation saying so. Signing for your goods before they are checked makes it impossible to make a claim against the courier for damaged goods.
13.   Wrong delivery
We work extremely hard to ensure that mistakes caused by human error do not happen. However, if you should receive an incorrect item/s, please let us know within 7-days. If you intend on returning an item, which has been delivered incorrectly, it should remain unused and in its original packaging.
14.   Late deliveries – last minute orders
14.1   If you plan to go away on holiday and are counting on your order arriving before your departure it is important you read the following:
14.1.1   In order to deliver your goods it is necessary to employ the services of several shipping carriers. Our carriers are committed to delivering your order free of defects and on the day you expect them. Despite our best efforts, our control over unforeseen circumstances or simple human error is limited. For this reason, we are unable to promise or guarantee that your order will arrive on the day specified.
14.1.2   In order to avoid unnecessary inconvenience caused by a late delivery, please exercise common sense and order goods allowing enough time in case of unforeseen circumstances.
14.1.3   If we have failed to deliver your goods before you leave for holiday we request that you advise us that you will not be present to receive your order, so we may contact the courier to request the goods be held until your return. Please note that if you cancel goods, which have already left our premises, due to late delivery, you will be liable for the cost of returning goods back to our premises.
15.   Risk and ownership
Risk of damage to or loss of the goods passes to you at the time of delivery to you. You will only own the goods once they have been successfully delivered and when we have received cleared payment in full.
16.   Cancellation rights
16.1   Under the Distance Selling Regulations you are legally entitled to cancel your order within seven days, starting the day after receipt of your goods (with the exception of any made to order items). You do not need to give us any reason for canceling your contract nor will you have to pay any penalty. However, you will need to notify us if you wish to cancel your contract, either in writing or by email at customerservice@camperlands.co.uk. A customer service representative will provide you with a return reference and if required, advice regarding transportation of any returning items.
16.2   Please do not write instructions on the outside of manufacturers original packaging. Instead please pack returning item/s into a suitable box or packaging to preserve their original condition.
16.3   If you have received the goods before you cancel your contract then you must send the goods back to our contact address at your own cost and risk. If you cancel your contract but we have already processed the goods for delivery you must not unpack the goods when they are received by you and you must send the goods back to us at our contact address at your own cost and risk as soon as possible.
16.4   Once you have notified us that you are canceling your contract, the relevant sum debited by us from your credit card will be re-credited to your account along with the items normal postage delivery charge. However, in the event only part of an order is cancelled no delivery cost shall be re-credited. Before funds can be credited back to your account, cancelled items must be returned to us within 30 days and received by us in the condition they were in when delivered to you. If you do not return the goods delivered to you or do not pay the costs of delivery, we will be entitled to deduct the direct costs of recovering the goods from the amount to be re-credited to you.
16.5   You will be re-credited for the costs incurred in returning faulty or unsatisfactory goods.
16.6   The contract price we pay shipping carriers for returning your unwanted goods (referred to as a 3rd party collection service) is greater than the cost of the original delivery. The cost of returning an item to our premises will be either £12.50 or £35.00, depending on the size and weight of the goods being returned.
17.   Cancellation by us
17.1   We reserve the right to cancel the contract between us if:
17.1.1   we have insufficient stock to deliver the goods you have ordered,
17.1.2   we do not deliver to your area, or
17.1.3   one or more of the goods you ordered was listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical error or an error in the pricing information received by us from our suppliers.
17.2   If we do cancel your contract we will notify you by e-mail. Regarding payment, it is our general policy not to accept payment for an order until goods have been confirmed ready for dispatch.
18.   Liability
18.1   If you do not receive goods ordered by you within 30 days of the date on which you ordered them, we will have no liability to you unless you notify us in writing at our contact address of the problem within 60 days of the date on which you ordered the goods. If you notify a problem to us under this condition, our only obligation will be, at your option:
18.1.1   to make good any shortage or non-delivery;
18.1.2   to replace or repair any goods that are damaged or defective; or
18.1.3   to refund to you the amount paid by you for the goods in question in whatever way we choose.
18.2   Both parties shall only be liable under this contract for losses, which are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the relevant breach of contract.
18.3   Notwithstanding the preceding sections, nothing in these terms and conditions is intended to limit any rights you might have as a consumer, under applicable local law or other statutory rights that may not be excluded, nor in any way to exclude or limit our liability to you for any death or personal injury resulting from our negligence.
19.   Guarantees
All goods sold by Camperlands come with a standard 12-month warranty against manufacturing defects when used in accordance with manufacturers instructions and guidelines. Some products carry an extended warranty offered by the manufacturers.
20.   Guarantee Claims
20.1   If you wish to return a product under guarantee you must submit a claim in writing, either by post or by email, at customerservice@camperlands.co.uk. You will be provided with an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorisation) reference, which will help us identify your records in any future correspondence.
20.2   You must send goods back to us at our contact address and at your own cost and risk. However, if the cost of returning goods exceeds £10.00, we reserve the right to make arrangements for collection of returning goods to minimise expenses.
20.3   Please send evidence of postage costs with your goods. We advise that you send your returns using a tracked delivery service, with appropriate insurance, to cover the cost of damaged or lost items.
20.4   Before a guarantee claim can be accepted, faulty goods must pass through a process of inspection to determine the exact cause of the fault. If, during the inspection we find evidence indicating the cause to be misuse, modification, or that goods have not been used in accordance with manufacturers operating instructions or guidelines, we may not be able to offer a replacement, exchange or refund. In such cases, you may have to pay a delivery charge, to cover the cost of returning your goods back to you.
20.5   Once a valid guarantee claim has been established, we will provide you with either a repair, exchange or refund. As a general rule if a product cannot be repaired it will be replaced. If we are unable to replace an item under guarantee, we will re-credit your account with the original cost plus, any charges incurred for the transport of faulty goods returned to our premises, up to a maximum of £10.
20.6   Most claims are completed within 5-10 working days. However, some tent and awning claims can take longer but no more than 30 days in total, as required by statutory law.
