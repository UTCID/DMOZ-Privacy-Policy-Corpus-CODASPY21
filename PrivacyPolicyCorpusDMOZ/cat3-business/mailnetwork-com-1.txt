Security & PrivacyFor mail and parcel
All our Affiliated Centers are specialists in the rental of private mailbox, packaging and shipping services. As well, each center adheres to the highest standards of confidentiality and security.
Each Center is a CMRA (Commercial Mail Receiving Agency). Your mail is handled in a private, secure fashion by experienced, bonded professionals. The confidentiality of mail processing is our major concern. Your privacy is protected and enforced under strict mail privacy laws. In fact, postal privacy laws are sometimes stricter than most civil laws. CMRAs are forbidden by law to reveal a box holder’s name, home address, phone number, or any other information. NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW YOUR ACTUAL PHYSICAL ADDRESS! The information requested is for our files only and can be given to a law enforcement agency only in the event of a formal inquiry.
