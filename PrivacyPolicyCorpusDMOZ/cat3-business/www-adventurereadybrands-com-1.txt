Your Privacy And Our Support For Your Informed Choice
The following information will provide you with information about online privacy, "cookies," how Adventure Ready Brands may use cookies, and the ways in which we will NOT allow any cookie, personal information, or data to be used in a manner that is contrary to Your Choice or Your Privacy.
Our Cookie Policy and All our Privacy Policies are firmly and unconditionally grounded upon these three simple promises:
Data passed by cookies will never contain your name, address, telephone number or payment details.
Adventure Ready Brands does not sell or disclose your personal details to third parties.
You can be confident that your privacy is important to us while, at the same time, you can have pleasing, informative, and satisfying visits to our websites.
What Are Cookies?
Cookies are pieces of computer code that allow small amounts of information to be passed from your internet browser to our web server. They allow your web browser, applications, programs, and your devices (cell phones, tablet, laptops, computers, etc.) and the websites you visit to recognize each other. For more detailed information about how cookies work, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Data passed by cookies will never contain your name, address, telephone number, or payment details.
Why Do We Use Cookies?
Cookies serve many functions. Some examples of Adventure Ready Brands’ use include: cookies confirm whether you are “logged in” or “logged out” of our site; cookies maintain items in your wish lists and shopping carts, and cookies eliminate overly repetitive information (or information you are otherwise not interested in) and replace that content with new and relevant information tailored specifically for you. Cookies are sometimes used with our marketing partners to present offers and advertising as you browse other sites on the internet. Anonymous Cookies (without any personal information such as name, address, phone, and payment information) also allows us to anonymously use Google Analytics to better understand how our users, customers, retailers, and others use our websites, to sort through raw data on which pages or special functions are preferred, and to help us continually improve our web sites, products, and services.
What Cookies Do We Use?
There are two types of cookie that may be used during your visit to an Adventure Ready Brands website:
Session Cookies are deleted after you visit our site and close your browser. Session Cookies remember you and your online shopping preferences for our website for the duration of your visit but Session Cookies are immediately and completely removed from your computer as soon as you close down your internet browser. Session Cookies allow you to add an item to your cart and then move through the checkout. Without these cookies that your web browser shares with our Online Stores you would not be able to place an order on this site.
Persistent Cookies are deleted after a set period of time or a desried action occurs.
Persistent Cookies may include data about items you have previously viewed, shopping preferences, and/or your log-in status for your account while browsing.
Persistent Cookies allow your web browser to keep the look and feel of your experience more consistent, keep items you have browsed readily available so that you do not have to “redo,” “research,” “re-shop” for the items you are interested in, and/or remind you that you have something in your cart.
By using your web browser’s cookie permissions and our website, you agree to and allow your web browser and our website to create, modify, and temporarily store cookies on your device to be used by your browser and by our website to recognize one another.
Like your local barista might know how you like your Mocha Latte, these Cookies assist your web browser and our websites make your shopping more satisfying with less repetition and less effort.
Turning Off And Deleting Cookies
Web browsers provide the option to turn cookies off/on; to allow/disallow some, none, or all cookies; and to otherwise control your cookie and privacy settings.
Instructions and settings for cookies can usually be found in the browser's 'Help' menu.
Note that refusing all cookies in your web browser will mean that you will be unable to access many websites, unable to complete a purchase on any website, and unable to fully enjoy your visit to our websites.
Note also that deleting and disallowing cookies are not the same thing.
Any website’s cookies can be deleted using your web browser. However, unless they are disallowed your web browser and the websites you visit will recreate them the next time you visit those websites.
We recommend that you periodically review your web browser’s cookie permissions for all the websites you visit – in that way, you will be better able make the best of all your web surfing.
Adventure Ready Brands Marketing Cookies
We work with marketing organizations and advertising firms that present online information and offers on our behalf.
Like other internet websites and Adventure Ready Brands websites these third parties use both Session and Persistent Cookies.
Adventure Ready Brands works with only those third parties, industry leaders, that can ensure that cookies remain at all times anonymous to them and others.
These cookies are used to deliver online ads more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.
All data collected by third party cookies are anonymous and will never contain your name, address, telephone number, email address or payment details.
Adventure Ready Brands will not disclose your personal details to third parties without permission.
