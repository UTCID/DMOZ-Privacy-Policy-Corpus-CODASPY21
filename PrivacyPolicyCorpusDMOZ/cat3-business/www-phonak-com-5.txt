Help your parents with hearing loss
Now it’s your turn to support the ones who have supported you
It's your turn
An open conversation
As our parents get older, they might become hard of hearing. In this case, it’s up to you to help them help themselves. It’s not always easy to discuss certain issues, but the sooner you do, the sooner you can help them to communicate better resulting in a positive, long-term outcome for both you and them.
Wearing hearing aids during my grandson’s game was the best thing that happened to me. What a great feeling!
I love you, let's talk
Here are some useful tips to help your parents in dealing with their hearing loss
The right time
Pick the right moment to sit down and talk in a compassionate manner. This will make it clear to them that you are doing it out of care and genuine concern. Explain to them that a decline in hearing could lead to missing out on magical moments.
Be the advocate
Addressing any type of issue takes a lot of courage and your full support is likely to help your parents better deal with the issue.
Attend the hearing evaluation appointment
Visit the doctor or hearing care professional with them. You can hear the information presented together and discuss the next steps openly.
Learn about the hearing aids
Do your homework and find out more about different hearing aids. This will help you to encourage them to understand the benefits e.g. improve the quality of their lives.
I remember you
The human voice is like a fingerprint. We may not hear a friends voice for twenty years but you will still recognize it when you hear it. Voices are like a wave of emotion, sending you down memory lane!
