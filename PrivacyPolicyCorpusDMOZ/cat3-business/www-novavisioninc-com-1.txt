Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY SUMMARY
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. Our practices on the information we collect and how we use it is noted in the section below: DETAILED INFORMATION PRACTICES.
Information Sharing
We do not sell your information to third parties. We do not share your information with outside parties or services except to the extent necessary to conduct the activities indicated in this privacy statement. We do not permit outside parties or services to process or use your information for any purposes other than those stated here.
As noted elsewhere on our web site, due to the nature of its business, NovaVision regularly cooperates with law enforcement agencies. If we suspect you are involved with counterfeiting or making a fraudulent purchase, we may proactively share your information with law enforcement agencies. From time to time, law enforcement agencies request information from us, and we comply when we believe that their access to such information is justified, or when we are compelled to furnish such information.
We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment to Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
Your Access to Your Information
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
If you are covered by applicable laws or regulations that grant you the right to request access to any personal information that we may hold, or the right to be forgotten, you may request such actions via the contact information below and we will respond within 30 days. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, if you exercise your right to be forgotten, we will delete your personal data from our systems and provide you with written confirmation of the deletion.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access, making corrections, or deleting any personal data.
Compliance
Our polices and practices are designed and intended to comply with
the General Data Protection Regulation passed by the European Union in 2016, which set rules for how companies manage and share personal data.

MailChimp Tracking Pixel
Some of our order follow-up emails are sent via an automated system.
We use MailChimp’s Mandrill service to deliver these automated emails. All of these automated emails will be related to a specific order that you placed with NovaVision. They will contain unsubscribe links in case you want to notify us that you do not want to receive them in the future.
If you open an order follow-up email from us, it may contain an invisible single-pixel image called a “beacon” that will allow MailChimp to detect when an email has been opened, or a link in the email has been clicked. MailChimp transfers this open and click information to us so that we can correlate it to existing information in our systems in order to understand whether users are responding to our email communications.
