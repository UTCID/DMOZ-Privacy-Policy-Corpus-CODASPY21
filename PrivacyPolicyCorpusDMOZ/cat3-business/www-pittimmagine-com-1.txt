BUYER INFORMATION NOTICE

When necessary, as part of carrying out an Event or an initiative connected to one, we may provide you with additional information in relation to any further processing which may be done, which is understood as being supplementary to or even just a specification of this information notice.
We invite you to read this information carefully and we remain available should you have any queries or require further information regarding how we process and how we safeguard your personal data.

CONTROLLER - CONTACT DETAILS
PITTI IMMAGINE S.r.l., with offices in Via Faenza, 111 – Florence, Italy, in the person of the legal representative pro-tempore, is the Controller in terms of processing personal data pursuant to and for the effects of EU Regulation 2016/679.
For any communication regarding privacy or to exercise a right due to a Data Subject under current legislation, the Controller has made this email address available: privacy@pittimmagine.com
CATEGORIES OF DATA – PROCESSING SYSTEMS
The personal data we process is that data requested on the paper form and/or by the computer registration system on the institutional site.
Generally speaking, we ask for personal details, company names, email addresses or telephone numbers.
The personal data provided on the registration form is also stored in a badge that we deliver to you in order to allow you to access the trade show.
By maintaining relationships with various companies, we will be able to collect information - personal and otherwise - relating to the company’s internal representatives (e.g. employees), such as contact details (email, telephone number, etc.), personal and tax details, company position, as well as other common personal data which is needed in order to fulfil contractual or professional dealings with the company. It should be noted that - in this regard - the company has the responsibility of divulging the contents of this information notice to company representatives whose data, for various reasons, is sent as part of the relationship with our company.
PROCESSING METHODS AND CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATION
Data is processed by means of IT tools and/or manually on paper, by persons expressly authorised by the Controller or, in any case, by persons bound by confidentiality agreements, using logic appropriate to the purposes for which the data was collected and, in any case, in order to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data.
The data collected will not be disclosed or disseminated to third parties pursuant to the law.
THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING - LEGAL BASIS
The personal data collected will be used for purposes connected with pre-contractual, contractual, legal, tax and accounting requirements, for service communications, to manage complaints and to provide information on our future trade show initiatives and events.
The personal data processed does not require your consent.
Indeed, processing the personal data collected is connected to pre-contractual and/or contractual issues, or is done to fulfil a specific legal obligation incumbent on the Controller, or is done to send information about services which are identical or similar to those you purchased when attending an event. In this latter case, the information activity is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in making you aware of our business and in promoting it amongst operators in the sector; within the limits of this purpose, and bearing in mind the professional relationship already established with you, we use the personal data, which you have provided us as part of the registration process in our system, to also send you our periodic Newsletter, without prejudice to your right to object to receiving the same, either from the outset or at any moment thereafter and without formality.
PROVIDING DATA
The data considered mandatory is that data needed to conclude a contract or to provide the requested services, or that data relating to the fulfilment of a specific legal obligation incumbent on the Controller (for example, the obligations related to keeping accounting and tax records). Failure to communicate this data will prevent a contract from being concluded or a service from being provided.
This data also meets one of the Controller’s legitimate interests which is to share this information with other companies in the "Centro di Firenze per la Moda Italiana" Group (of which Pitti Immagine S.r.l. is a part), due to organisational or coordination needs or to support the Controller’s activities, within the limits of necessity and proportionality regarding the purpose for which the data is sent, also taking into account the nature of the data processed and the relationship with the Data Subject.
TRANSFERRING DATA TO A THIRD COUNTRY
If data is transferred to a third country, the Controller will comply with the provisions of Chapter V of EU Regulation no. 679/2016. Every necessary precaution will be taken in order to ensure that the personal data is protected by basing this transfer on: a) adequacy decisions regarding third countries adopted by the European Commission; b) adequate guarantees given by the third party recipient pursuant to article 46 of the EU Regulation; c) adopting binding corporate rules.
The Controller will also transfer personal data, even in the absence of the aforementioned conditions, if one of the derogation situations exist as provided for by article 49 of the EU Regulation.
You may contact the Controller for more specific information on transfers made to a third country.
COMMUNICATION TO THIRD PARTIES
The data collected may be sent to third parties exclusively for the purposes specified above or to fulfil a connected, instrumental or supporting activity.
These third parties will process the data as independent Controllers or, depending on the case, as External Processors expressly appointed by the Controller. In this latter case, Processors will follow the Controller’s instructions and will be under the Controller’s supervision.
This essentially involves the following categories:
- the Controller's employees, suppliers and collaborators;
- external companies and other professionals who carry out specific services on our behalf;
- a service provider, to send the newsletter, which has been appointed as an external processor;
- bodies and Public Administrations for compliance with legal requirements;
The access badge which we deliver contains personal data that you provided us with in the registration form. Exhibitors are able to read this badge through an optical reader and this allows them access to the personal data contained in this form, in compliance with the purposes and the processing methods each one employs.
STORAGE TIMES
A Data Subject's personal data will be kept for the time necessary to fulfil the existing relationships between the parties and to fulfil the relative obligations, without prejudice to storing data for a longer period as may be required by law. Once such a period ends, the data will be erased.
