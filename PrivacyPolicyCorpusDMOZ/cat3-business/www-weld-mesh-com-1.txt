Terms and Conditions
Terms and Conditions
CONDITIONS OF SALEAny contract of sale between this company and a customer will be subject to these conditions and the placing of an order with this company shall be deemed to be an acceptance by the customer of these conditions. Any terms or conditions appearing in any document issued by the customer shall have no effect. No variation of any of these conditions shall be binding on this company unless expressly accepted by this company in writing. All photographs, pictures and illustrations shown are for information purposes only. Actual products delivered may vary from those shown but will be in accordance with the specification as described.
PRICEPrices to be charged will be those ruling at the date of the despatch of the material, unless otherwise stated. Prices given in any quotation are those ruling at the date of the quotation and are given for guidance only. All prices are subject to alteration without notice.
DELIVERYThe rate or time of delivery in relation to any consignment or series of consignments is estimated as accurately as possible. This company will do its best to meet the requirements of the customer as to time of delivery as specified in the customer's enquiry but no guarantee or warranty as to time of delivery or rate of deliveries is given or implied. The 24hr delivery option applies to orders placed before 11am. Orders placed after 11am will be shipped on the following day using a 24hr weekday service.
DELIVERIES TO SITESWhere customers request deliveries to sites on or by a specific date, this company will do its best to meet such requirements but the company cannot give any guarantee nor can any claims be accepted on account of late deliveries. This is because our transport service, although normally reliable, is subject to various contingencies beyond our control, including road and weather conditions, breakdowns, accidents, delay in unloading at customer's premises, etc. Furthermore, we are sometimes in the hands of outside transport contractors over whom we do not have direct control. Customers are strongly advised, therefore, not to send labour to sites without first ensuring that the goods have been delivered to the desired location.
DAMAGE OR LOSS IN TRANSITThis company will not accept responsibility for material damage or lost in transit, unless this company and the carriers are notified of the complaint in writing, within three days of the receipt, by the customer of the consignment in respect of which damage or shortage is alleged. And an adequate opportunity is given for inspection of the material in the case of non-delivery of a complete consignment notification must be made in writing within 21 days of the date shown on the advise or delivery note. In any event the liability of this company in respect of material damage or loss in transit, shall be limited to the cost of replacement of the loss or damage material and in the case of damaged goods shall be the subject to such goods being returned to this company at the risk and expense of the customer.
DEFECTIVE MATERIAL(a) This Company shall not be liable to the customer for any consequential or special loss or damage or any loss of profit suffered by the customer by reason of any defect or errors in quality or measurement of goods supplied.(b) Any goods returned to this company by the customer at its own expense within seven days of the receipt, thereof by the customer, and which are found on examination by this company to be defective in quality or measurements. Will be replaced by this company free of charge but that will be the limit of this company's liability.
CUSTOMERS MATERIALIf this company agrees to carry out work on customer's own material, or to store customers' goods after an invoice has been presented for the goods. Such material or goods will be held at the customer's risk and this company will not be responsible for the damage by accident, fire, flood, deterioration or any other cause.
GUARANTEES AND WARRANTIESAny condition warranty guarantee or statement as to the quality of any material or its fitness for any purpose whether express or implied by statute by the common law or by any custom of trade or otherwise is hereby excluded unless given expressly in writing by this company.
