Policy
At GetFactored.com
Inc., your privacy and the security of your personal data are a
primary concern of ours. GetFactored.com believes that you should
be aware of who we are, the types of information we may collect
on our web site, and what we do with your personal information.
Our overall privacy policy is simple. Under no circumstances will
GetFactored.com sell or share any personal information about you
to or with any person or organization except as authorized by you,
to our authorized agents, the lenders in our network, or as may
be required by law or court order.
Who we are
GetFactored.com is an online marketplace that brings you, the
customer, together with up to four factoring companies in our
network who compete for your business. GetFactored.com is an intermediary
which brings the parties together.
Information we collect
When you come to the GetFactored.com site, you complete a simple
qualification form that includes certain personal and financial
information about you and/or your business including your name,
phone number, social security number, e-mail address and income.
Limited distribution of personal information
At your direction (when you click on the "Submit" button), the
information that you provide to us on the Client Profile will
be sent through the GetFactored.com system and presented to our
authorized agents and up to four factoring companies in our network.
After our authorized agents or up to four factors in our network
receive your information, they may contact you directly via phone,
email or other communications. All of our factors operate under
federal and/or state laws and regulations and believe, as we do,
that the Internet is an exciting and secure place to do business.
As our factors may keep and use your information whether or not
you qualify for financing with them, we recommend that you contact
them directly for more information about their specific privacy
policies.
GetFactored.com may notify you about a special offer from one
of our promotional partners. We do not reveal your name, address
or any other identifying information to that promotional partner
unless you affirmatively respond to the promotional offer. At
your request, GetFactored.com will not send you any information
or offers unrelated to your request for financing.
GetFactored.com may also share certain aggregated data with our
factors and other third parties for general marketing and demographic
purposes, however, this data DOES NOT include any of your personal
identifying information.
