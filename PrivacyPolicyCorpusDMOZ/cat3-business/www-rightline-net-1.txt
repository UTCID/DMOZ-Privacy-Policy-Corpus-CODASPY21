RightLine Privacy Statement:
RightLine (Pro Right Line Corp) is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains our privacy policy and
clarifies how we use the personal information that we obtain from our users.
Please read the following text. It explains our practices regarding your personal information, and how they relate to you when

that is of interest to our readers. We request your name, email address, and other personal information when you signup to use our services.
- RightLine performs research based on the information you give us when you register on our website, take part in a survey, contest or other promotion. The

Whenever you place an order with RightLine, we ask for your name, telephone number, mailing address, email address and credit card information. This information is used to
process your order. If needed, we may use this information to contact you about the details of your order.
In addition to processing your order, RightLine sometimes uses the information to let you know about services or products we think may be of interest to you.

process, or to protect RightLine rights or property.
RightLine does not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to any advertiser.
