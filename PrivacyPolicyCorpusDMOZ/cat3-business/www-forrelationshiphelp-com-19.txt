Passive-Aggressive Awareness is great!
I loved episode 35#2 talking about Passive-Aggressive Behavior. I was married to someone like this for a long time and everything you described were things I experienced. I loved the discussion about healthy and unhealty boundaries and about being empowered and prepared rather than in flight mode. So good!
Kim JulenApple Podcasts listener
Wonderful Insights!
I truly enjoyed the episode about CEN (Children Emotional Neglect). As a school teacher, I realized I have seen other teachers contribute to the emotional imbalances of their students. Then when they come to my class, students flourish and I believe it is due to safe, loving space and relationships created in the classroom. I agree we must be aware of how our actions have a profound impact on childhood development. Definitely a podcast worth sharing!
The SIMA Method
Fantastic info:
Dr. Shaler offers fantastic info to help women stop being treated poorly, manipulated, or abused. Great expert interviews on this podcast.
DrMom2TwinsApple Podcasts listener
Helpful for all relationships in my life. My brain is full of insights listening to Rhoberta's shows. I love learning about "emotionally unavailable" people, not just men. This helped me understand my relationship with my mother, too.

Contrary Ways to Overcome Detox, Pain, Addiction & Shame
GUEST: Dr. Will Horton
by Rhoberta Shaler, PhD on February 5, 2020 at 6:13 PM
Wow! I was so prepared to ask tough questions of my guest, Dr. Will Horton, because I found some of the claims he made sounded outrageous to me. Really? And, I asked those tough questions about addiction, recovery, pain, and shame...and more! When I read one of his book titles, my antennae went up: "How to Get Others to Do What You Want and Have Them Think It was Their Idea" Oh, no! That sounds so manipulative and under-handed, right? That's why I called this episode "Contrary Ways." He is a […]

The Upsides For Workplace Warriors To Lead And Succeed - GUEST: Jordan Goldrich
by Rhoberta Shaler, PhD on January 30, 2020 at 1:57 AM
Do you feel like a warrior when you go to work? Do you feel like you MUST be a warrior?Warriors are tough. Is that a necessity for getting people to work together and produce desired results?My conversation with Jordan Goldrich, author of Workplace Warrior, had some surprises. The subtitle of his book is "People Skills for the No B.S. Executive." He immediately brought up the word, abrasive, to describe many leaders. Not a surprise! Sometimes people think they have to be tough, competitive, and […]

Ass-Kickin' Advice for Step-Moms
GUEST: Kathy Hammond
by Rhoberta Shaler, PhD on January 23, 2020 at 7:34 PM
We have so many images of step-moms. Angels, devils, and everything in between! My guest, Kathy Hammond, is the author of How to Kill Your Husband's Ex, Attorneys and Then Some: Ass Kickin' Advice for Stepmoms.You might relate! She says, "Books on step parenting hope to evoke a kumbaya feeling. That might work if everyone involved in the step family dynamic is mature, empathetic and certainly not narcissistic. In reality are very raw emotions of jealousy, anger, resentment and fear, experienced […]

Mid-Life Dating, Sex & Finding True Love
GUEST: Jonathon Aslay
by Rhoberta Shaler, PhD on January 10, 2020 at 12:09 AM
Fearful? Skeptical? Not sure you trust yourself to choose well? Unsure about trusting when you start to date again? You'll likely have some of that when you're dating in mid-life, especially if you have left a toxic relationship? You hear the term, self-love, so often these days. Do you know what it really means? What are your assumptions about it? I actually don't use that term much because of the ambiguity. In today's episode, my guest, Jonothon Aslay, and I discuss this because sometimes the […]

How Living in Alignment with Your Human Design Leads to Success
GUEST: Chetan Parkyn
by Rhoberta Shaler, PhD on December 27, 2019 at 5:53 PM
HUMAN DESIGN? What immediately came to mind when you read that?Human Design is a system that "illustrates the genetic codes in our personal makeup, both from a conscious perspective, and also from the unconscious ancestral input," as today's guest, Chetan Parkyn says."We get distracted in our lives from the moment we arrive here.We become conditioned not only from the attitudes and behaviors of the family and circumstances in which we are born, but we also have ingrained in our genetic codes […]
