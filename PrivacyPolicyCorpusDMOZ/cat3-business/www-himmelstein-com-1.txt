Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, the IP address that we collect may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because, with some broadband connections, your IP address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer.
We track pages visited on S. Himmelstein and Company’s website, the amount of time spent on those pages, and the types of searches done on them.
S. Himmelstein and Company also captures and stores information that you transmit. This may include:
