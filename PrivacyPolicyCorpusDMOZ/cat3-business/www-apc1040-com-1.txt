Privacy Policy
While we maintain nonpublic personal information (physical & electronic) about our clients, we have procedural safeguards in place that comply with federal regulations to guard our client’s personal information. Our company privacy policy is not to disclose any nonpublic personal information about our clients or former clients to any other third parties, except as permitted by law.
Section 7216 regulations require tax preparers to acknowledge and respect the taxpayer’s right to direct the preparer to disclose tax return information only as the taxpayer sees fit, within appropriate limits and safeguards.
Unless section 7216 or section 301.7216-2 specifically authorizes the disclosure or use of tax return information, the taxpayer must provide written consent before we will disclose or release a taxpayer’s data to any third party.
