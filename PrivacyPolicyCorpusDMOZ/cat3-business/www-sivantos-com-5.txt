Our global data privacy compliance program also consists of the implementation of unambiguous authorizations and consents, EU Standard Contractual Clauses, model contracts/transfer agreements, privacy principles, privacy statements, privacy policies and country-specific registrations and filings. This Privacy Policy covers the Web site www.sivantos.com, and all other applicable Sivantos web sites (individually “Web Site” and collectively “Web Sites”) as well as software applications (‘Applications’) provided by Sivantos and services provided by Sivantos through the Web Sites (‘Services’).

In the event of any inconsistency between the English and non-English version of this Privacy Policy (where translated for local requirements), the English version of this Privacy Policy shall govern, to the extent permitted by applicable laws.
C. Data Controller
The data controller of the Web Sites is Sivantos. Where a registration or consent form is presented on our Web Sites or in your use of any of our Applications or Services, the data controller may vary and may be an affiliate or subsidiary of Sivantos (collectively ‘Sivantos’) or yourself depending on the actual offering or the purpose of the data collection and may be displayed on the applicable registration or consent form. For inquiries you may contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@sivantos.com.
D. Data Processor (processing of patient data)
In cases where Sivantos is a data processor, the use of information collected through e.g. Sivantos Software (Mobile or Desktop) shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which Sivantos is engaged for.
Sivantos might have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes, e.g. where you are a patient of one of our partners (“Audiologist”) and would no longer like to be contacted by your Audiologist that use our service, please contact the Audiologist that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the T&C with our business partners.
Your Audiologist will respond to reasonable requests to review your personal data and to correct, amend or delete any inaccuracies. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
