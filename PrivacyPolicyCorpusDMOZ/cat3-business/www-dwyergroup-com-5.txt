pursuant to a written contract.
“Third Party” means a person or entity who is not a business that collects Personal

We will not collect a category of Personal Information not listed above,
or use any Personal Information collected in any of the above categories
for a business purpose not listed above, without first providing you with notice.
You have the right to request certain information regarding the Personal
Information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months. You
may make such a request up to twice in a 12-month span. Please note that
there are circumstances in which we may not be able to comply with your
request pursuant to the CCPA, including when we cannot verify your request
and/or when there is a conflict with our own obligations to comply with
other legal or regulatory requirements. We will notify you following submission
of your request if this is the case.
If you would like to request (1) the categories of Personal Information
collected about you; (2) the categories of sources providing that Personal
Information; (3) the categories of third parties with whom we have shared
that Personal Information; and (4) the business purpose for collecting
that Personal Information,

that you can complete and submit to make a request for information that
we will then verify; if you use the telephone number, you will be guided

Verification Process
Upon receipt of the personal information request from the consumer, Neighborly
will attempt to identify the consumer in one of three ways before initiating
the request to know, request to opt-out, or request to delete procedures.
Consumers authenticated under an existing password-protected account are
automatically verified. For unauthenticated consumers that submit a request
to know, two data points are used to identify the consumer before the
process is initiated. For unauthenticated consumers that submit a request
to delete, three data points are used to identify the consumer before
the process is initiated.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the rights
provided by the CCPA set forth in this California Privacy Policy. Please
note that a legitimate denial of a request for information, deletion,
or to opt-out is not discriminatory, nor is charging a fee for excessive
or repetitive consumer requests as permitted by the CCPA.
Deletion of Your Personal Information
You have the right to request that we delete certain Personal Information
that we have collected. Please note that there are circumstances in which
we may not be able to comply with your request pursuant to the CCPA, including
when we cannot verify your request and/or when there is a conflict with
our own obligations to comply with other legal or regulatory requirements.
We will notify you following submission of your request if this is the case.
If you would like to request that we delete your Personal Information pursuant
to the requirements of the CCPA,
click here or call 1-800-851-2230. The link will take you to an interactive webform
that you can complete and submit to make a request for deletion that we
will then verify; if you use the telephone number, you will be guided
through a process that will allow you to submit a verifiable request.
Authorized Agents
You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights under the
CCPA on your behalf.
Pursuant to the CCPA:
Only a business entity or natural person registered with the California
Secretary of State may act as an authorized agent.
You must provide the authorized agent written permission to exercise your
rights under the CCPA on your behalf.
We may deny a request from an authorized agent on your behalf if the authorized
agent does not submit proof that he, she, or it has been authorized by
you to act on your behalf if we request such proof, as permitted by the CCPA.
Even if you use an authorized agent to exercise your rights under the CCPA
on your behalf, pursuant to the CCPA we may still require that you verify
your own identity directly to us. This provision does not apply if you
have provided with a power of attorney under California Probate Code sections
4000 to 4465.
Personal Information of Minors – Opting In
We do not sell the Personal Information of minors who are at least 13 years
old and less than 16 years old unless those individuals have opted in
to the sale of their Personal Information. To opt in, such a minor must
first clearly request to opt in via the link below, after which the minor
will be required to separately confirm that election. As part of that
confirmation process, the minor will be informed that he or she has the
right to opt out at a later date and what the process is for doing so.
If you are 13, 14, or 15 years old and would like to opt in to the sale
of your Personal Information,
click here.
We do not sell the Personal Information of minors who are under 13 years
old unless a parent or guardian of that minor affirmatively authorizes
the sale of that Personal Information. We verify that the individual making
such an authorization is the minor’s parent or guardian by providing
a consent form to be signed by the parent or guardian under penalty of
perjury and returned to the business by postal mail, facsimile, or electronic
scan. As part of that verification process, the parent or guardian will
be informed that he or she may opt out on behalf of the minor at a later
date and what the process is for doing so.
If you are the parent or guardian of a minor under 13 years old and would
like to opt in to the sale of the minor’s Personal Information,
click here.

Right to Opt-Out
You have the right to request that we do not sell Personal Information
that we have collected. If you exercise that right, please note that pursuant
to the CCPA we may have to subsequently inform you that you need to opt-in
if the sale of your Personal Information is required to complete a transaction
you have initiated. If opting-in is required, we will provide you with
the necessary instructions.
If you would like to request that we do not sell your Personal Information
pursuant to the requirements of the CCPA,
click here or call 1-800-851-2230. The link will take you to an interactive webform
that you can complete and submit to make a request for deletion; if you
use the telephone number, you will be guided through a process that will
allow you to submit a request.
You may also submit a request to opt-out by sending an email with the required
information to the following email address
privacy@dwyergroup.com.
If you use an authorized agent to submit your request to opt-out, we will
request that the agent provide us with proof that he, she, or it has been
authorized by you to act on your behalf. The CCPA requires you to provide
the authorized agent written permission to exercise your rights under the CCPA.
If you opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information, we will wait at
least 12 months before asking you if we may sell your Personal Information.
You have the right to opt-in to the sale of your Personal Information after
you have opted out. If you would like to opt-in to the sale of your Personal
Information,
click here or call 1-800-851-2230. Opting-in is a two-step process in which you will
first clearly request to opt-in, and then separately confirm that choice.
