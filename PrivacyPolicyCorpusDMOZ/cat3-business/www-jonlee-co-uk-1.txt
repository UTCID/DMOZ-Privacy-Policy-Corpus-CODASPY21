levels of service.  There may also be a need, in providing recruitment services, for us to provide information to carefully selected suppliers and other 3rd parties in order to meet our contractual and legal obligations.  Our commitment to you is that we will only process your personal data to the extent required in order to meet these objectives.1.4          GENERAL PRINCIPLESWe will comply

purposes (“lawful purposes” under the GDPR):Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with youWhere we need to comply with a legal obligationWhere it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third-party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interestsFor some activities, such as marketing communications, where you have given your consent.More specifically we use your personal data for the following purposes: To assess your skills, qualifications, and suitability for applicable rolesTo carry out background and reference checks, where applicableTo communicate with you about the recruitment process and roles which may be relevant or of interest to youTo keep records related to our hiring processesTo analyse and take steps to improve the services we provide to our clients and CandidatesTo comply with legal or regulatory requirements4.1          FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW AND WHY WE WILL USE YOUR DATALegitimate Interests It is in our legitimate interests to decide whether to contact you about particular roles and/or forward your application to appropriate clients and assist in taking your application forward.  This is because it is beneficial to our business to recommend suitable and appropriately qualified Candidates to our clients and to help match our Candidates to appropriate roles that are relevant to the Candidate’s wishes.  We may also provide a prospective employer or client with information you have provided to us (for example, the results of psychometric or skills tests) or to confirm your references, qualifications and criminal record, where this is appropriate and in accordance with EU laws.  We share this type of information in order to further our legitimate interests as a profit-making business providing recruitment services to our clients.We may also contact you more generally to discuss and align your employment needs and career development with opportunities we can present you with and relevant information and articles we can provide to you.  This is because it is in our legitimate interests to ensure that our Candidates are offered relevant, appropriate opportunities which correspond with their own career aspirations.We may also from time to time provide the opportunity for you to contribute to interactive services such as surveys or social media content.  This allows us to differentiate ourselves as a recruitment provider and compete within our market and is therefore within our legitimate interests to process your data in this way. We will always check beforehand that you are happy for us to use your data in this way. We may send you direct marketing material from time to time. The use of your personal data for this purpose will be proportionate, have a minimal privacy impact, and will be highly relevant to the service provided. You will always be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from such material.Contractual Obligations We may also need to process your personal information for the purposes of entering into or performing a contract of employment or contract for services with you.  This will include carrying out our internal administrative processes such as payroll processes if we engage you as a contractor/consultant, or in order to raise invoices.Legal ObligationsWe are required as part of our recruitment process to seek, confirm and hold certain Right to Work documents about you such as a passport or ID card copy, proof of address or UK driving licence in order to process you as a Candidate for a vacancy that could result in your employment within the EU.We must also comply with our wider legal obligations. We may therefore share your data in connection with crime detection, tax collection or litigation activity, whether actual or anticipated.If You Cannot Provide Any Relevant Data If you fail to provide information when requested, which is necessary for us to consider or progress your application (such as evidence of qualifications or work history), we may not be able to progress your application successfully or recommend you to our full range of clients.  For example, if one of our clients requires that employees are subject to a credit check or references for a particular role and you fail to provide us with relevant details, we may not be able to take your application further.5.            HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATAWe have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.  In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third-parties who have a business need-to-know.
