We likewise prohibit the transmission, distribution or posting of any matter which discloses personal or private information concerning any person or entity, including without limitation phone number(s) or addresses, credit debit cards, calling card, user account numbers/ passwords or similar financial information, and home phone numbers or addresses. Even though all of this is strictly prohibited, there is a small chance that You might become exposed to such items and You further waive Your right to any damages (from any party) related to such exposure.
By posting material or content to this Site, You hereby grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free sublicenseable worldwide license and right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform (either publicly or by digital audio transmission) or publicly display all or any portion of the material or the content in any existing or future media, known or unknown.

If You believe that someone has posted material or content that violates the Terms or the law, we ask You to promptly notify us by email at info@cigarworld.com.

By reserving this right, we do not undertake any responsibility in fact to investigate complaints or to remove, disable or restrict access to or the availability of the complained of material or content. We support free speech on the Internet and therefore will not act on complaints that we believe, in our subjective judgment, to be deficient. If You believe that Material remains on this Site that violates Your rights, Your sole remedy will be against the person(s) responsible for posting or storing it, not against us. By taking advantage of the Good Samaritan procedures set forth in this Section 14, You waive any and all claims or remedies which You might otherwise be able to assert against us under any theory of law (including, but not limited to, intellectual property laws) that arise out of or relate in any way to material or content posted by Users on this Site or our response, or failure to respond, to a complaint.
If we determine in our sole discretion that a violation of the Terms has occurred, We may pursue any of legal remedies, including but not limited to the immediate deletion of any offending material from its site, cancellation of Your account and /or the exclusion of any person(s) who may have violated any Terms. We also could pursue legal claims for violations of criminal and/or civil laws as applied by the relevant jurisdiction. We will cooperate with any investigation by any Federal, State, or local body or any court or tribunal legitimately exercising its rights. Such cooperation may be without notice to You. If we believe in our sole discretion that any user content or involvement with the site may create liability for Us, we may take any actions that it believes are prudent or necessary to minimize or eliminate its potential liability, including but not limited to, the release of User information. In sum, we reserve the right to refuse use or access to the Site or this service to anyone at any time, and to remove any User content for any reason, and without notice.
