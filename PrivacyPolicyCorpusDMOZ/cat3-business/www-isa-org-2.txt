How we use your Personal Information
Our ability to deliver the products and services of ISA relies on members and customers (supporters) to give us contact information (like your address, phone number, and email address) as well as demographic and profile information (like your zip code, age, industry, and areas of interest). We collect limited financial information, such as a check or credit card number, as required. We use this personal information primarily to provide services and targeted offerings. These services may involve periodically mailing our supporters communications, as well as catalogs and promotions of products and services we offer, including related information. One such service, an online membership directory, is available to ISA Members. From time to time, we will authorize companies, who we feel have something of value and relevance, to our supporters to receive and use this personal information. Financial information is used solely for payment of services requested. The collected demographic and profile data is used to tailor content and promotional information based on the supporters known or anticipated interests.
Supporter financial information will be transmitted as necessary and required to banks and credit card or other financial transaction processer for the processing of such payments to our accounts. Financial information will be maintained by us and the banks, credit card, or other financial transaction processer as necessary and required for the processing of transactions and for auditing, legal, or other similar business purposes. Such financial information will not be transmitted to unrelated third parties and will be encrypted as applicable.

Site of Processing of Personal Data
Personal data of individuals collected by ISA may be stored and processed in the United States, Europe, or any other country in which ISA, its vendors, or partners maintain facilities. ISA generally collects and processes personal data in the US.

Personal data may be retained by ISA for so long as necessary or useful to pursue the legitimate interests of ISA. Other factors may include: the duration of the business or contractual relationship between ISA and an individual; archiving of historical information; and legal requirements, including limitations periods during which a legal claim might be brought.
