Order acceptance and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place on the dispatch to you of the products ordered unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order, or you have cancelled it.
Non-acceptance of an order may be a result of one of the following:
The product you ordered being unavailable from stock. Our inability to obtain authorisation for your payment. The identification of a pricing or product description error.
The contract will be concluded in English. Contract cancellation under the Distance Selling Regulations. Please note that you are entitled to cancel the contract if you wish provided that you exercise this right and notify us no longer than 14 working days after the day on which you receive the products. If you wish to exercise your right to cancel the contract after your order has been dispatched, we will refund the original purchase price and, when charged, the cost of standard delivery, provided that you have notified us in no longer than 14 working days after the day on which you receive the products, and that you have taken reasonable care of the products and have not used them. We can deduct money from a refund where an item that has been returned appears to have been used. (Beyond handling) If the goods are not in a re-saleable condition, we reserve the right to refuse a refund, or deduct up to 20% of the purchase price from the refund amount. Please follow the steps set out in our Returns procedure. Returns Returning cancelled goods. Once you have notified us of your wish to cancel, we require you to return the goods to us at your own expense, as soon as possible, by;
Filling out our returns form and enclosing a copy along with the goods you wish to return. Failure to send a completed returns form will prevent us from identifying your order and processing accordingly. Return to our store, where we will be happy to refund or exchange your purchase as needed. The goods are returned at your own expense and risk. We recommend using a recorded delivery service or equivalent as we cannot accept responsibility for goods lost/damaged in transit, as the goods remain your risk until signed for by our goods-inward department.
If your item is excessively large or heavy we can arrange for a courier to collect it at a price which we will attempt to agree with you in advance. (As an indication collection charges vary between £25.00 to £45.00 but will not exceed £50.00, depending on the item).  All items being returned back to us must be boxed ready for collection, failure to do so, may result in a failed collection and additional costs may be applied. All collections will be made in advance between Monday to Friday.

BB5 0SD Guarantee All our products are guaranteed against manufacturing defects for 12 months from date of purchase unless otherwise specified. If a fault occurs within the first 30 days on receipt of the product we will collect the goods and refund your money. After this period we shall arrange to have the item repaired or replaced after it has been inspected. Any delivery charges will be met after inspection of the item. The guarantee does not cover faults caused by accidents, neglect, misuse or general wear and tear. Fibreglass poles are considered consumable parts and are excluded from the manufacturers guarantee unless otherwise stated. Damaged or defective returns Fill in our Returns Form (Under the Returns section of our Terms)
If you wish to return goods which you believe are damaged or faulty, please telephone us on 01254 386978 between 10:00am-4:00pm Monday to Thursday, and 10:00am-12:30pm on Friday. We will discuss with you the best method of returning the item. Upon receipt by us of the goods, we will examine them for damage. If the fault is obvious and inherent, we will process the refund, repair or exchange, at your choice, within 30 days of receipt of the goods. If the fault is not obvious, we may need to return the goods to the supplier for testing, we normally expect a response from the supplier within 4 weeks. The following products that usually need to be examined by the supplier are; electrical or gas appliances, cabin and awnings.  In the event that the goods are found to be damaged or faulty we will either, refund to you the price you paid for the goods, plus the original delivery cost (if applicable) or, after consulting with you, have the product repaired and sent to you or if the product cant be repaired a replacement sent to you. In the event that the fault or damage is not down to the manufacturing process, but to misuse or damage sustained after purchase, or subject to normal wear and tear, we will contact you to find out whether you wish the goods to be returned to you or repaired, if a repair is feasible. In these circumstances, both the cost of repair and return of the goods to you would be at your expense. If a refund is required, we will refund to you the price you paid for the goods, including the delivery charge (if applicable and returned within 30 days of receipt). Refunds will be made as soon as possible after receipt by us of the returned goods and, in any event, not later than 30 days after receipt of the order. We will apply the refund to the original card with which you bought the item(s). If this method is not reasonably possible, you will need to contact us by telephone on 01254 386978 or by email to sales@pennineoutdoorleisure.co.uk, to arrange an alternative method of repayment. This may cause a delay in repayment, but should not take longer than 28 days.
If an exchange of goods is required:
After receipt of the returned items we will send out to you, if possible, a replacement or an alternative product. If the new product is more expensive than the original product, the balance of the price owed to us, together with the delivery charge, will be charged to your original payment card, or an alternative card, details of which will have been provided by you, prior to dispatching the goods to you. If the new product is cheaper than the original product, we will give you a refund for the balance, less the cost of delivery of the new product. Please Note that we reserve the right not to refund or replace any returns, if you fail to provide us proof of purchase for the goods/return of goods which are faulty; or not of satisfactory quality; or not fit for purpose; or which do not correspond to their description.
Availability We aim to hold all items in stock, however, should an item be more popular than we expected, there may be occasional delays when ordering. If this does occur then an advice note will be attached with your invoice. Sometimes we may experience difficulties with the supply of certain products and may therefore provide a substitute of the same or better quality at no extra cost. Description of products Each product purchased is sold subject to its product description which sets out additional specific conditions related to that product including, without limitation, terms and conditions concerning estimated delivery dates and times, warranties, after-sales service and guarantees.

We endeavour to despatch all orders within 1-3 working days but should we envisage a delay of more than 7 working days we will contact you. All goods are sent by courier and will require a signature, under no circumstances will goods be left unless signed for. In the event when a signature is unattainable after 2 attempts, the delivery address will be carded and a depot contact number supplied.
