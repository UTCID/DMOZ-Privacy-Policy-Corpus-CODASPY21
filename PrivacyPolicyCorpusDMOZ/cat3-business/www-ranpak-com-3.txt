DISPUTE RESOLUTION
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS
ARBITRATIONS
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OUR SERVICES, PRODUCTS, THESE TERMS, INCLUDING
OUR PRIVACY POLICY, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, OR
VALIDITY THEREOF OR THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH
THE SITE (COLLECTIVELY, “DISPUTES”) WILL BE SETTLED BY CONFIDENTIAL BINDING
ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT each party retains the
right to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; and (ii) seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation
of a party’s copyrights, trademark, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii) an “IP
Protection Action”).  The exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and
federal courts located in Cleveland, Ohio and each of the parties hereto waives
any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
You acknowledge and agree that both you and Ranpak are
waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class
representative or class member in any purported class action or representative
proceeding.  Further,
unless we both otherwise agree in writing, an arbitrator may not consolidate
more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of
this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive termination of these Terms.
We
both agree that these Terms should be interpreted and enforced under the
Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1, et
seq.) because they memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.  This section will survive termination of
these Terms.
ARBITRATION RULES
The
arbitration will be administered and governed by the Comprehensive or Expedited
Arbitration Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS),
whichever is appropriate and in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated
(the “JAMS Procedures”), which are available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by
calling 1-800-352-5267.
The
parties expressly agree that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or
class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration will be limited to
the resolution of individual claims only.
DISPUTE NOTICE AND ARBITRATION
PROCESS
Prior
to initiating an arbitration proceeding, you must first send Ranpak a written
statement setting forth your name, address, and telephone number, the facts
giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested (“Dispute
Statement”).  The Dispute Statement to Ranpak
must be emailed to inquiries@ranpak.com.  If we are unable to resolve your claim within
thirty (30) days, then either party that desires to initiate an arbitration
must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified
in the JAMS Procedures.
An arbitrator,
and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive
authority to resolve all Disputes relating to Ranpak’s services and products,
as well as all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not
limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or
voidable.  Notwithstanding this broad
delegation of authority to the JAMS arbitrator, a court may determine the
limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is an IP Protection
Action.
ARBITRATION LOCATION AND
PROCEDURE
Unless
the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county
where you reside.  If your claim does not
exceed $10,000, then: (i) the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis
of documents the parties submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing
or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary; and (ii) if there is
a hearing, you may choose whether to participate in person or by telephone.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to
a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Procedures.  Subject to the JAMS Procedures, the
arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of
information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of
arbitration.
ARBITRATOR’S DECISION
The arbitrator’s
decision will include the essential findings and conclusions of law upon which
the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment
on the arbitration may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction
thereof.  The arbitrator’s award of
damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Disclaimer of Warranties,”
and “Limitations of Liability” sections above as to the types and amounts of
damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory and injunctive relief only in favor
of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
the claimant’s individual claim.  If you
prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.  Ranpak will not seek, and hereby waives all
rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and
expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
FEES
We will
pay or (if applicable) reimburse you for all JAMS filing, administration, and
arbitration fees for any arbitration commenced by you or Ranpak pursuant to the
terms of this section.
TIME LIMIT FOR RESOLVING
DISPUTES
The
parties agree that any cause of action either may have with respect to the Site
or our services, products, and Content must be commenced within one (1) year
after the Dispute arises, notwithstanding any statutes of limitations to the
contrary.  Many states’ laws set statutes
of limitations that are longer than one (1) year.  If you live in a state that has statutes of
limitations that are longer than one (1) year, by agreeing to these Terms, you
are agreeing to shorten the time you have to bring a claim.  This
means that if you wait longer than one (1) year to initiate arbitration under
this section, you will lose some or all rights you may have to any recovery,
including the right to recover damages, in connection with a Dispute.
The
terms of this Dispute Resolution section survive any termination of these
Terms.
RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OR REJECT
FUTURE CHANGES TO DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION
You

arbitration procedure or waiver of class and representative proceedings
specified in this section by sending a written letter to Ranpak at Ranpak Holdings Corp., 7990 Auburn Road, PO Box 8004, Concord Township, OH 44077,

within thirty (30) days of your first visit to and use of the Site that
specifies your: (i) name; (ii) mailing address; and (iii) request to be
excluded from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure or waiver of
class and representative proceedings specified in this section.  In the event you opt-out consistent with the
procedure set forth above, all other terms and conditions of these Terms will
continue to apply.  If you do not so
opt-out, then the terms of this “Dispute Resolution” section will apply.
Notwithstanding
the provisions of “Changes to Terms of Use” section above, if Ranpak changes
this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms
(or accepted subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change
by sending Ranpak written notice (including by email to inquiries@ranpak.com)
within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated
in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of our email to you notifying
you of such change.  By rejecting any
change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Ranpak
in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of
the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to
these Terms).

regarding the Content or the Site.  If,
for any reason, any provision of these Terms is deemed to be invalid or
unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force
and effect.
You

a waiver of those rights.  The waiver of
any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by
a duly authorized representative of Ranpak.
Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either
party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its
