1.    What Kind of Information We Collect
Information You Provide
Whether accessing the DD/BR Online Services from your home computer, mobile phone, or other device, Dunkin’ Brands and its agents may collect information you directly provide. For example, we collect information when you register an account, join the DDPerks Program, enroll in our mailing lists or text message campaigns, locate a restaurant, apply for a job, interact with Customer Care, or otherwise communicate or transact with us through the DD/BR Online Services. We also collect information when you access the DD/BR Online Services using voice functionality services available through the microphone on a third party device.
The information we collect may include Personal Information.  “Personal Information” is information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination).  Some examples of data we collect include the following:
Name and Contact Data:  We collect your first and last name; mailing address; telephone number; e-mail address, and other similar contact data.  If you are a franchisee, we collect your contact information and that of your employees;
Credentials:  We collect username and password , and similar security information (for account authentication and administration);
Demographic Data:  We collect information about your interests and activities, your gender, month and day of birth, and other demographic information;
Payment Data:  We collect data necessary to process your payments if you make purchases through the DD/BR Online Services, such as your financial account information and other payment information, or other forms of payment including Stored Value Cards (which may include Personal Information);
Contacts:  In some cases, we may collect information that you provide about others, including Personal Information, such as when you send your contacts benefits, coupons, or gifts. We will use the information you provide to fulfill your requests, including (if applicable) sending them a text message, and we will not send marketing communications to your contacts unless they have a separate relationship with us. Such functionality is intended only for United States residents.  By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request;
Content:  We collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and information you provide to customer service.  We also collect the content of your communications as necessary to provide you with the DD/BR Online Services you use;
Contests/Promotions:  We may collect additional Personal Information necessary for the administration of certain promotional events or features of our Loyalty Program; and
Resume Data.  We collect data as necessary to consider you for a job opening if you submit an application to us, such as your employment history, transcript, writing samples, and references.
If you are accessing the DD/BR Online Services as a current or potential franchisee, we may ask you to provide additional Personal Information, including your full date of birth, contact information, financial information, and employment history.
You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the DD/BR Online Services that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information. Please note that if you access the DD/BR Online Services using voice functionality services available through the microphone on a third party device, it may collect background noise or communications that you do not voluntarily provide. Therefore, you should take steps to prevent the communication of unnecessary information when accessing the DD/BR Online Services using voice functionality services.
Personal Information once “de-identified” is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.
Information Collected Automatically
In addition, we automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with the DD/BR Online Services.  We may use Service Providers to collect this information.  Some examples of information we collect include the following:
o    Service Use Data: We collect data about the features you use, the pages you visit, the e-mails and advertisements you view, the products you purchase, the time of day you browse, your referring and exiting pages, and other similar information.
o    Device Connectivity and Configuring Data.  We collect data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and other similar information. This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising ID (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
o    Location Data. We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).
We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“Tracking Technologies”), to collect information about your interactions with the DD/BR Online Services, including information about your browsing and activity behavior:
o    Log Files.
A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the DD/BR Online Services, such as your service use data.
Cookies
Cookies are small text files placed in your device browser directories to store your information about your use of the DD/BR Online Services and your activities online (collectively, “Cookies”).  A Cookie will typically contain the name of the domain (internet location) from which the Cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the Cookie (i.e. when does it expire), and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.  We use Cookies so that we can improve your online experience – for example, by remembering you when you come back to visit us, and making the content you see more relevant to you. Cookies also enable us to track online purchases made through the DD/BR Online Services.
Pixel Tags (“Web Beacons” or “clear gifs”)
Pixel Tags are small graphic images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Pixel Tags may be used to count the number of visitors to the DD/BR Online Services, to monitor how users navigate the DD/BR Online Services, and to count content views.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the DD/BR Online Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the DD/BR Online Services, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Location-identifying Technologies
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location. For example, if you have Bluetooth enabled on your device, we may use beacons to determine if you are near a Dunkin Brands physical location (or another retailer), and to send you advertising or promotions via push notifications. We may also associate your location captured via Bluetooth with your device identifier, and combine that data with transactional information to improve the services offered to you.
Voice Processing Technologies
Voice processing technologies collect audio through the microphone on your device, for purposes such as responding to your instructions or requests, and providing you with relevant content based on your requests. We only maintain the audio long enough to complete your instruction or request and then immediately delete it. We may use non-audio data associated with the collection for additional purposes such as data analytics and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Device Fingerprinting.
Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.
In-App Tracking Methods
There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as mobile Ad IDs to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.
Connected Devices
We may use technology in connected devices, including your vehicle, home assistant, or smartwatch, to determine your location, serve advertising, or provide promotional offers. Information we collect through your connected devices will depend on the device and your settings, but may include voice, location, payment information, or biometric data. We may also associate the information from connected devices to your device identifier and combine that with transactional information to improve the services offered to you. For more information please refer to the sections on “Location-identifying Technologies” and “Voice Processing Technologies” above.
Some information about your use of the DD/BR Online Services and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the DD/BR Online Services and certain Third Party Services.
For further information on Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, please see “Third Party Services” and “Your Rights and Choices” below.
Information from Franchisees and Other Third Party Sources
We may also receive information about you from third parties. For instance, we may receive information about your purchases and inquiries from our third party payment processors. Likewise, we may receive information about you from our franchisees. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with information we have collected about you through the DD/BR Online Services, we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third party sources vary over time, but may include:
•     Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.
•     Social networks when you reference our Service or grant permission to Company to access your data on one or more of these services.
•     Partners with which we offer co-branded services, sell or distribute our products, or engage in joint marketing activities.
•     Publicly-available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.

By entering, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.
5.    Third Party Services, Devices and Links
You may find that it is possible to link from third party websites to the DD/BR Online Services, or access content or links on the DD/BR Online Services to websites, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (“Third Party Services”). For example, links to order.dunkindonuts.com and order.baskinrobbins.com take you to a Third Party Service. To the extent we combine information from Third Party Services with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the DD/BR Online Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. However, Third Party Services are not under our control, and may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. Further, to the extent that you access the DD/BR Online Services using voice functionality services available through the microphone on a third party device, that third party device may collect information about you. Dunkin’ Brands is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any Third Party Services or third party devices. You should consult the privacy policy of the Third Party Service to or from which you access content or link to determine the information practices of that Third Party Service.
Social Networking and Other Third Party Features
In addition, the DD/BR Online Services contain third party technologies that allow you interact with or connect the DD/BR Online Services to certain Third Party Services (“Third Party Features”).  For example, you may use a Third Party Feature to order our products, find a route to the closest store location, send a gift card, apply for a job, “like” or “share” our content over social media, register or log-in to the DD/BR Online Services through your social media or email account, or chat with a bot. If you use a Third Party Feature, both Dunkin’ Brands and the applicable Third Party Service may have access to certain information about you and your use of the DD/BR Online Services and the Third Party Service. Similarly, if you publicly reference the DD/BR Online Services on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Dunkin’ Brands in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with the DD/BR Online Services. When you use Third Party Features, including to connect the DD/BR Online Services to any social network or other Third Party Service, please remember that you are bound by the privacy policy of the social network or Third Party Service, and we do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such social network or Third Party Service.

Analytics and Online Advertising
We may use Google Analytics and other third parties for analytics services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to track the actions of users of the DD/BR Online Services, to measure statistics of user activity on the DD/BR Online Services, and provide other services relating to DD/BR Online Services activity and internet usage.  We may also engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on the DD/BR Online Services and/or on Third Party Services.  These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to track marketing efforts and to deliver “interest-based advertisements” that may be more relevant to individual consumers.  For example, if your information indicates that you live in an area where a particular in-store promotion is going on (such as a new snack offering), you may receive an advertisement on the DD/BR Online Services and/or on a Third Party Service that is specific to that promotion. As above, the information collected and stored by any such Third Party Services remains subject to their own policies and practices.

Tracking Technologies Generally and "Do Not Track”
If you do not wish to receive Cookies or wish to manage when you accept Cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your device.  Although you are not required to accept our Cookies, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the DD/BR Online Services. For example, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any products and services that require you to sign in. To find out more about Cookies, including how to see what Cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
With respect to our mobile apps, you can stop all collection of information via the app by uninstalling the app.  Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the DD/BR Online Services may not work.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit.  Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms.  For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) (“Principles”). This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest based advertising purposes. More information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info/. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third parties that participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, please follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.  An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  Opt-out Cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all of your browsers and devices, you will need to opt-out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your mobile apps, please follow the instructions at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on the DD/BR Online Services.  It means that the online ads that you do see from participants should not be based on your particular interests. Dunkin’ Brands is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your use of the DD/BR Online Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the Principles.
7.    Your California Privacy Rights
Dunkin’ Brands may share personal information as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law with third parties and/or Affiliates for such third parties’ and Affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California customer, you are entitled to request certain information regarding our compliance with this law. To request such a notice, please send a letter to: Dunkin' Brands, Inc., 130 Royall Street, Canton, MA 02021, Attn: Customer Service.

If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority.
9.    Children’s Online Privacy
Dunkin’ Brands recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The DD/BR Online Services are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children under thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) from children in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA.
If you become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information as defined by COPPA through the DD/BR Online Services, we ask that you e-mail us at customerservice@dunkinbrands.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information as defined by COPPA, we will delete the child’s information from our records to the extent required by COPPA.
10.    International Transfer
Dunkin’ Brands controls and operates the DD/BR Online Services from within the United States of America. If you are accessing the DD/BR Online Services from outside of the US, please be aware that information collected through the DD/BR Online Services may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the US and other jurisdictions.

11.    Data Controller Information

When you provide your information through a website or application operated by Dunkin’ Brands that posts a link to this Privacy Policy, the data controller is Dunkin’ Brands, located at the address in the section entitled “Contact Us”. Sometimes Dunkin’ Brands operates as a processor on behalf of a franchisee, a separate legal entity, which is the controller. If that is the case, the Privacy Policy of the website or application in question will identify the name of the applicable franchisee controller.
12.  Data Security
We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the DD/BR Online Services.
