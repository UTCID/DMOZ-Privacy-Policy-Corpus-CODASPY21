HomeCookie Policy
Cookie Policy
Goodfellow uses cookies to store information on your computer to give you the best possible experience on our website.  Most of the cookies used do not collect personal details or information that identify a visitor, and are only used by us to improve how the website works.  Of the cookies that do collect personal information, Goodfellow will not use your information for purposes which are not clear when you provide your details, and will not disclose it outside Goodfellow other than to the relevant authorities if requested.
1.  What is a cookie?
Cookies are simple text files that a website saves to your computer or mobile device using your internet browser. These cookies allow a website to recognise a user’s device.  Their purpose is to help organise and store browsing information.
Cookies are either set by the Goodfellow website, in which case they are referred to as "first-party cookies", or are "third-party cookies" which are set by other websites and/or services that run content on the page you are viewing.
Most websites use cookies to improve their users’ experience. For example, cookie-enabled websites don’t think you’re a new visitor every time you move to a new page on a website and therefore improve your user experience by letting you navigate between pages more quickly and easily.
Cookies also allow a website to remember you, and your browsing preferences, either for the duration of your visit using a "session cookie" or for repeat visits using a "persistent cookie".
2.  Our cookies policy
To make full use of the features of the Goodfellow website, your computer or mobile device will need to accept cookies.  By using our website, you agree that we can place cookies on your device.
An element of data from our website is sent to our visitor’s browser and this is then stored on their system. The information allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our website – for example, how visitors use it, what pages they view and the length of each visit, etc.
If you do not wish cookies to store your data you can disable them by modifying the settings in your browser at any time; the ‘help’ function within your browser should tell you how to do this.  However, you may not be able to use all the features of our website if the cookies are disabled.
3. Types of cookies used by Goodfellow
First-party cookies First-party cookies are set by our website and they can only be read by that website. They can make your experience on the web more efficient by recording your browsing activities, such as what pages and content you’ve looked at, when you visited, and what you searched for while visiting the website.
Session cookies Session cookies are stored temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from the user’s device when the browser is closed or the cookies time out.
Persistent cookies This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period and is not deleted when the browser is closed. These cookies are used to save your preferences so that they persist when you return to the website and improve the user experience.
Analytical cookies These are cookies used to collect information about how people access and use a website and are the type mostly used on our website.  You can control how much data can be stored in that cookie, but you cannot choose what type of information is allowed to be stored.
4.  Why use cookies?
Cookies are used to improve services for you through, for example:
Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same
information several times during one task.
Recognising that you may already have given a username and password, so you don't need
to do it for every web page requested.
Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and
ensure there is enough capacity that there are no restrictions.
Analysing anonymous data to help us understand how people interact with our services so we can make them better.
5.  Enabling/disabling cookies
Different browsers have different ways of allowing you to enable or delete cookies, or limit the kinds of cookies that can be placed on your computer. When choosing your internet browser (e.g., Google Chrome or Safari), you may want to consider which best suits your privacy preferences and meets the requirements of any IT policy which may apply.
To check out the settings in a browser, use the "help" tab or look under "tools" for settings like "options" or "privacy". From there, you may be able to delete cookies, or control when they can be placed.
Note:  If you disable cookies you may limit your browsing experience. For example, you may need to enter information repeatedly, or you might not get personalised content which is of relevance to you.
If you have any questions concerning our cookie policy please feel free to contact us by email at webmaster@goodfellow.com.
