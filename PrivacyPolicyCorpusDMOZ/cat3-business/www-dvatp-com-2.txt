Thanks for visiting dvatp.com.
This site is committed to protecting your

This site does not collect personal information about you just because you

However, in order to improve the usefulness of the site for its visitors
and identify potential abuse, the system automatically collects and maintains

(e.g., ".com"; ".edu"; or ".gov");
the Internet Protocol Number;
the date and time the
web site is visited;
the type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
the pages you visit; and
if you linked to this site from another
Web site, the address of that site (called the "referrer").
This information does not identify individual visitors.
This site does not
share this information with the general public, but will submit it to outside
parties to provide evidence of abuse or if required by law.
The site sets a single session cookie used to support the login process.
