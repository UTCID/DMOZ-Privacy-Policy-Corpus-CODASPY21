We need to know your name, billing address, delivery address, telephone number, email address, payment details and in some cases we require the names of each of each person in your party that you have been authorised to provide in order to complete your booking. This information can also be collected when you call us to make a booking.
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. We will use your personal information in the following circumstances:
When you consent to us doing so;

Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:
Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests);
Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes.
