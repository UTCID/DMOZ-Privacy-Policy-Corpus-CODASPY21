What is Data Protection?
If you give your personal details to an organisation or individual, they have a duty to keep these details private and safe.
As the organisation who controls the contents and use of your personal details, Capital Credit Union (CCU) is the Data Controller. CCU has appointed a ‘Data Protection Officer’ (DPO), who is responsible for the protection of your rights in how we conduct our business and ensuring compliance with Data Protection laws and regulations.
On 25th May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. This sets out a series of new EU laws concerning how data is processed and used. The objective of the regulation is to strengthen and standardise data protection laws for all EU citizens.
These regulations apply to any organisation that controls and/or processes data on behalf of an individual or group of individuals. Those responsible for adhering to these regulations include employees of the organisation, including contractors, consultants, agents and third parties who have access to data either directly or indirectly.
