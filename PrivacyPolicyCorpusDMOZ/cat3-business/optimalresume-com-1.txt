websites, including https://optimalresume.com and our
organization-branded websites (collectively, the "Sites") provided by OptimalResume, so please read them
carefully. Note that Section 18 of these Terms contains a mandatory arbitration provision that requires

certain disputes. After reviewing these terms, please indicate your acceptance by clicking the "I Agree"

REASONABLE CONTROL, SUCH AS SITE INTERRUPTIONS, DELETIONS OF FILES OR EMAILS, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS,

PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR

OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER
ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE).
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF
THE OPTIMALRESUME PARTIES (JOINTLY) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE ORDER, RECEIPT OR USE OF
SERVICES PURCHASED FROM THE SITE EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID FOR SUCH SERVICES IN THE NINETY (90) DAYS PRIOR

THE OPTIMALRESUME PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE ANY SUCH OPTIMALRESUME FOR, ALL
CLAIMS YOU HAVE OR MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS.
IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 1542, WHICH
STATES "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST
IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."
18. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND
CLAIMS WITH OPTIMALRESUME AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, YOU AND OPTIMALRESUME AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR
CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE FINALLY
DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION GOVERNING, AS
APPLICABLE, CONSUMER OR COMMERCIAL DISPUTES BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR. Arbitration uses a neutral
arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury); arbitration allows for more limited
discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and result is subject to very limited review
by courts. In an arbitration you have the right, at your expense, to be represented by an attorney of
your choosing. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief under these Terms that a court can
award under these Terms. You and OptimalResume agree that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in
the United States in the same county and state as your billing address if a consumer dispute and
otherwise in Raleigh, North Carolina. OptimalResume further agrees that your filing fee for an
arbitration will be capped at the amount set by the American Arbitration Association. You agree that, by
agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of
this provision, and that you and OptimalResume are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and
the termination of your use of the Services. REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM, YOU AND OPTIMALRESUME AGREE THAT
EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and
OptimalResume agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate more than one person’s claims
with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision
shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
party’s individual claim.
19. Modifications to the Site and Services
We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, the Site (or any features or parts thereof) or the provision of any Services at any
time.
20. Termination
Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole
discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Site and to order or receive and use the
Services, at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no
liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any
amounts that you have already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
OptimalResume operates the Site from North Carolina, U.S. These Terms and the transactions they
contemplate, including without limitation their interpretation, construction, performance and
enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the state of North Carolina, U.S.A. without reference to
conflict or choice of law provisions, as applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such
jurisdiction. The International Convention on the Sale of Goods, and other international treaties that
are not mandatory with respect to contracts made and performed entirely in the U.S.A., shall not apply.
If Section 18 is found to be unenforceable, the exclusive forum for the resolution of any dispute
relating to these Terms shall be in the state courts of Wake County, North Carolina, U.S.A., or the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, and you agree to personal
jurisdiction of such courts over you with regard to any dispute relating to these Terms and agree to
service of process on you by e-mail to the address you have submitted on the Site, if any, and by any
other means permitted by law.
22. Notice
All notices, demands, or consents given by you under these Terms will be in writing and will be deemed
given when delivered to OptimalResume at the following contact: legal@optimalresume.com. Any notices to
you may be made via either e-mail or postal mail to the address in our records or via posting on the
Site. Please report any violations of these Terms to OptimalResume at the contact listed above.
23. Severability
If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause
or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of
any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these
Terms.
24. Survival
All rights and obligations of you and OptimalResume under these Terms which by intent or meaning have
validity beyond or by their nature apply or are to be performed or exercised after the termination or
expiration of these Terms shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for the period so
specified, if any, or for perpetuity.
25. Miscellaneous
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and OptimalResume relating to your access to and
use of the Site and your order, receipt and use of Services. These Terms, and any rights and licenses
granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of
OptimalResume. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in
any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and our failure to assert any right or provision under
these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided
herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer
third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
