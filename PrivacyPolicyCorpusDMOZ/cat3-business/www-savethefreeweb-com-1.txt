Privacy Policy
Hot Neuron LLC respects your privacy and we have
drafted this document to try to address any concerns
that you may have about the information we collect
and how it is used on SaveTheFreeWeb.com.
Hot Neuron LLC may revise this Privacy Policy at any
time without notice.
It is your responsibility to check this policy periodically.

What personally identifiable information is collected?
Currently, the only part of the SaveTheFreeWeb.com service
that requires users to provide any personally identifying information
(name, email address, street address, etc.) is the process of creating
an account for the discussion forum (you cannot post messages
without creating an account).
Creation of an account requires
a valid email address which does not become part
of your public profile.
The user may optionally supply their
name and other personal information for display in the
public profile of their discussion forum account, but this
information is not required.
We encourage the user
to remember that any information they voluntarily put into their
public profile or post in the discussion forum may be
retrieved by other users or by entities employing automated
software to collect such information (e.g. spammers).
If you send correspondence to
us, we may store a copy (which means that we will have
your email address and name).
What are cookies and how are they used on SaveTheFreeWeb.com?
A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent from
a web site such as SaveTheFreeWeb.com to your computer where it is
stored on your hard drive.
When you access that web site
in the future, your browser sends that cookie back to
the web site, which allows the site to recognize you as
someone it has seen before.
SaveTheFreeWeb.com makes use of cookies so that it can provide you
with personalized services such as discussion forums.
We may also use cookies to help us monitor your use of SaveTheFreeWeb.com
for the purpose of generating aggregated statistics and
targeted advertising and content on our site in order
to increase its usefulness to you.
Please be aware that our advertisers and service providers
may use cookies of their own which we do not control.
If you do not wish to have SaveTheFreeWeb.com use cookies to
identify you, you can turn off cookies in your browser.
Disabling cookies will make some features
of SaveTheFreeWeb.com (such as logging in to the
discussion forum) unusable.
How are IP addresses used?
An IP address is a set of numbers assigned to your
computer when you connect to the internet.
The SaveTheFreeWeb.com
site records the IP addresses of people using the
site.
This information may be used for monitoring
the use of the site or reporting aggregated statistics.
This information may also be used when we feel it
is necessary to protect our site, enforce our
Terms of Use,
or enforce the law.
Advertisers and Third Parties
Please be aware that advertisers on SaveTheFreeWeb.com
and third party sites which SaveTheFreeWeb.com links
to are not subject to the SaveTheFreeWeb.com privacy policy.
Our advertisers may use cookies for various reasons.
They may, for example, use cookies to avoid showing you the same
advertisement many times, to measure which ads you respond to, or
to track your behavior when you leave the SaveTheFreeWeb.com site.
Hot Neuron LLC does not provide personally identifying
information (e.g. your name, email address, etc.) that
we collect from you (for example from your use of the
discussion forum or from feedback which you email to us)
to third parties unless it is with
your explicit consent (generally for the purpose of
providing an additional contracted or co-branded service) or
if we believe in good faith that it is necessary
for the enforcement of the law or our
Terms of Use
agreement.
We do not rent or sell your personal information.
We may provide aggregated statistics about the users
of SaveTheFreeWeb.com to third parties.
Security Information
You should keep your password secret and be
extremely cautious when using shared
computers.
Be sure to
logout
from any public computer you use and exit
the browser to ensure that nobody else
can access your personal information.
Please be aware that whenever data is
transmitted or stored there is always some
risk of theft or misuse.
