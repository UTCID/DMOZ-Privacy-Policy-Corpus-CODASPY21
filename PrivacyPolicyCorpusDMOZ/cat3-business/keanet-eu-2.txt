Culture is of extraordinary importance today, and of necessity, as it shapes values that determine our future, notably in relation to powerful disruptive technological and scientific development (linked to progress in biotechnology, genetic or data processing) as well as political upheavals threatening democracy. A future without culture would be a cause for great concern, as nothing would prevent humans from becoming like machines (a neuronal being) devoid of autonomy, ethic, values (freedom and justice), warmth, sentiments, convictions and consciousness.  In such a future, mankind would thus be denied any specificity, incapable of establishing a distance with “reality”, cut off from life and nature.
Global challenges (climate, migration, sustainability, health) are leading to the emergence of new international solidarities building a world citizenship. Our connected and globalized world requires a cultural policy that goes beyond the traditional national frame and that integrates other cultures.
Modern cultural policy should be designed to help culture work as a stimulant, an agent of transformation  steering a new enlightenment and collective will. The KEA Manifesto is designed to empower communities and individuals.

Cultural Policy should ensure that cultural work is considered as any other work in any other profession and remunerated accordingly.

The work that is involved in the performing arts has undergone various transformations that are clearly visible in times of crisis, such as the one that we are currently living through now because of COVID-19. The artistic “vocation” is faced with many barriers and obstacles: the urgency of economic survival, the imperatives of programming, the presuppositions of the competition for funding, the social urgencies (although these can open up a space for reflection, they are also a constraint through their imposition of political agendas and through their definition of what is supposed to happen). In Portugal we are witnessing the gradual paring down of artistic structures and of working conditions, which are marked by precariousness and intermittence. If artistic work is heavily dependent on public policies, then the logic of its enhancement and increased value does not escape its commercialisation. I would like to know more about European Theatres to do a comparative study. See my article “Emerging patterns of artistic organizations
in Portugal”, Sociologia del Lavoro, nº 157, 2020.

Thank you for your comment and link to your work. We are just starting now our research for the European Commission on ‘the situation of theatres in the EU’, the study will be published in the second half of 2021;
