Responsibility for User-Generated Content Posted on or Through this Website
You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User-Generated Content.
This means that you, not OtterBox, are entirely responsible for all User-Generated Content that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the User-Generated Content you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permission to post it.
Because we do not control the User-Generated Content posted on or through this Website, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that User-Generated Content. You also agree and understand that by accessing this Website, you may encounter User-Generated Content that you may consider to be objectionable. We have no responsibility for any User-Generated Content, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein. We are not liable for any loss or damage of any kind you may claim was incurred as a result of the use of any User-Generated Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through this Website. The User-Generated Content posted on or through this Website expresses the personal opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not necessarily reflect the views of OtterBox or any person or entity associated with OtterBox.
You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it. You own the copyright in any original User-Generated Content you post. We do not claim any copyrights in User-Generated Content. However, by using this Website you are granting us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive, fully paid, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, publish, transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and commercialize User-Generated Content you post in any and all media or form of communication whether now existing or hereafter developed, without obtaining additional consent, without restriction, notification, or attribution, and without compensating you in any way, and to authorize others to do the same. For this reason, we ask that you not post any User-Generated Content that you do not wish to license to us, including any photographs, videos, confidential information, or product ideas.
We may disclose and/or remove User-Generated Content. OtterBox has certain rights. We have the right (but do not assume the obligation) to:
monitor all User-Generated Content;
require that you avoid certain subjects;
remove or block any User-Generated Content at any time without notice at our sole and absolute discretion;
disclose any User-Generated Content and the identity of the user who posted it in response to a subpoena or whenever we believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order, to prevent or investigate a possible crime or other violation of law, to protect the rights of OtterBox or others, or to enforce these Terms of Use; and terminate your access to and use of this Website, or to modify, edit or block your transmissions thereto in our sole discretion.
You agree that our exercise of such discretion shall not render us the owners of User-Generated Content you post, and that you will retain ownership thereof as described above.
Restrictions on User-Generated Content. It is a condition of these Terms of Use that:
you do not upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available:
any User-Generated Content that is unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, racially disparaging, indecent, or invasive of another’s privacy;
any User-Generated Content that constitutes or encourages activity illegal under criminal or civil law;
any User-Generated Content that is false, misleading, or fraudulent;
any User-Generated Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information or proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
any User-Generated Content that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including User-Generated Content which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights, confidentiality rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any individual, living or deceased, or any legal entity;
any User-Generated Content that contains the image, name or likeness of anyone other than yourself, unless (i) that person is at least eighteen years old and you have first obtained his/her express permission or (ii) that person is under eighteen years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian;
any request for or solicitation of any personal or private information from any individual;
any request for or solicitation of money, goods, or services for private gain;
any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; or
any User-Generated Content that contains advertising, promotions or marketing, or which otherwise has a commercial purpose;
you do not impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; or
you do not violate any local, state, national or international law, rule or regulation.
By posting User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the User-Generated Content and have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the User-Generated Content is accurate, and (iii) you are at least eighteen years old and you have read and understood—and your User-Generated Content fully complies with—these Terms of Use and applicable laws and will not cause injury to any person or entity.
Removal of User-Generated Content
In general. On certain pages of this Website, we may provide to you a tool to report objectionable User-Generated Content. If that tool is not available, you can report objectionable User-Generated Content by contacting us using the information provided below. While we do not have any obligation to remove any User-Generated Content from this Website merely because of a removal request, we will review all such requests and will remove User-Generated Content that we determine should be removed, in our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms of Use and applicable law. Please be aware, however, that if the User-Generated Content has already been distributed to other websites or published in other media, we will not be able to recapture and delete it. Also, a back-up or residual copy of the User-Generated Content we remove from this Website may remain on back-up servers.
Violation of copyrights. OtterBox does not knowingly violate or permit others to violate the copyrights of others. We will promptly remove or disable access to material that we know is infringing or if we become aware of circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.
If you are requesting removal of content because of a violation of your copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that your own work, or the work of a third party for whom you are authorized to act, is featured on this Website or has been otherwise copied and made available on this Website in a manner that constitute copyright infringement, please notify us immediately. Your notice must be in writing and must include:
an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on this Website (including the URL, title and/or item number if applicable, or other identifying characteristics);
your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and, if you are not the owner of the copyright, the name of the owner; and
a written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Your statement must be addressed as follows:
Intellectual Property Manager - Copyright
Otter Products, LLC
209 S. Meldrum Street
Fort Collins, Colorado, 80521
Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.
Your Feedback
Although we do not claim ownership of User-Generated Content you post using this Website, the Feedback you provide to us through this Website will be and remain our exclusive property. Your submission of Feedback will constitute an assignment to us of all worldwide rights, title and interests in your Feedback, including all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in your Feedback.

Modification and Discontinuation
We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify, edit, delete, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently this Website (or any portion thereof) and/or the information, materials, products and/or services available through this Website (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

Entire Understanding
These Terms of Use (together with our Privacy Policy, which is expressly incorporated herein) contain the entire understanding between you and us with respect to use of this Website and no representation, statement, inducement oral or written, not contained herein shall bind any party to this agreement.
Severability and Non-Waiver
Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision, and a waiver by us of any right under these Terms of Use on any occasion will not in any way constitute a waiver of such right or any other right on any other occasion. In the event any provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid, such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining portions of these Terms of Use, and the parties will substitute for the invalid provision a provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. These Terms of Use will apply in lieu of and notwithstanding any specific legend or statement associated with any particular document or information exchanged.
Law & Jurisdiction
These Terms of Use shall be subject to, governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Colorado in the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles. This Website is operated from the State of Colorado and is intended to be accessed only by persons in the United States and Canada. Access to, or use of, this Website or information, materials, products and/or services on this Website may be prohibited by law in certain countries or jurisdictions. You are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws of the country from which you are accessing this Website.
Dispute Resolution
We and you agree that any dispute or claim relating to any OtterBox product or any controversy or claim of whatever nature arising out of or relating to use of this Website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, with some limited exceptions listed below.
Governing Law: The resolution of any disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of Colorado without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
Informal Dispute Resolution: Before filing a claim against OtterBox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally. In the event of a dispute, you must notify OtterBox by sending a written statement that sets forth (i) your name, address, and contact information, (ii) the facts giving rise to the dispute, and (iii) the relief requested. You must notify OtterBox of a dispute by sending this information to legal@otterbox.com, ATTN: Notice of Dispute. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after submission, you may commence arbitration.
Binding Arbitration: If you and OtterBox do not resolve any dispute by informal dispute resolution, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration. You are giving up the right to litigate all disputes in court before a judge or jury. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award. The rules governing arbitration are different than those in court. Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages as a court.
Class Action Waiver: Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. You may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed under these Terms of Use. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Arbitration Procedure & Fees: Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. In any arbitration OtterBox commences, OtterBox will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. OtterBox will also pay all arbitration fees for claims up to $75,000. For claims involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a dispute involves. OtterBox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Neither the agreement to arbitrate nor the informal dispute resolution process applies to disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, OtterBox’s, or either of our licensors’ intellectual property rights. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. In addition, either you or OtterBox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Larimer County, Colorado or any United States county where you live or work. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you took part in the informal dispute resolution process. However, you specifically agree that any claims in small court are governed by these Terms of Use, including the Class Action Waiver section.
Severability: If the class action waiver in these Terms of Use is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then it will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of these Terms of Use is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect.
Judicial Forum for Disputes: In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and OtterBox agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in state court in Larimer County, Colorado. Both you and OtterBox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.
Limitation on Claims: To the extent permitted by law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of an OtterBox product must be filed in the appropriate forum within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.
