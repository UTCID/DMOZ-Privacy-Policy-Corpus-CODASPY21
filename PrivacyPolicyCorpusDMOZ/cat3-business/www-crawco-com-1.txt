Local laws; export control
Crawford controls and operates the Sites from its headquarters in the United States of America and the Materials may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you use the Sites outside the United States of America, you are responsible for following applicable local laws.
Feedback
If you send or transmit any communications, comments, questions, suggestions or related materials to Crawford, whether by letter, email, telephone or otherwise (collectively, “Feedback”), suggesting or recommending changes to our Sites or Materials, including, without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, all such Feedback is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary. Except as prohibited by applicable law, you hereby assign all right, title, and interest in, and waive all moral rights in (or where such moral rights cannot be waived, irrevocably consent to or any acts or omissions by the Crawford, its licensors and successors and any other person authorised by the Crawford, its licensors and successors which may infringe your moral rights) and Crawford is free to use, without any attribution or compensation to you, any ideas, know-how, concepts, techniques or other intellectual property and proprietary rights contained in the Feedback, whether or not patentable, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and selling, directly or indirectly, products and services using such Feedback. Where the foregoing assignment is prohibited by law, you hereby grant Us an exclusive, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up license (including the right to sublicense) to use and exploit all Feedback as We may determine in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that Crawford is not obligated to use, display, reproduce or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts or techniques contained in the Feedback, and you have no right to compel such use, display, reproduction or distribution.
Language
The Parties hereto have expressly required that these Terms and all documents and notices relating thereto be drafted in the English language.
General
Crawford prefers to advise you if we feel you are not complying with these Terms and to recommend any necessary corrective action. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Crawford, may result in immediate termination of your access to the Sites without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. Any disputes relating to these Terms or the Sites will be heard in the courts located in Fulton County in the State of Georgia. If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. Crawford’s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Crawford and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Crawford about the Sites. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.
