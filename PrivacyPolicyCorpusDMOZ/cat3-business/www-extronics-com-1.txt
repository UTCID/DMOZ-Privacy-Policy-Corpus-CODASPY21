This information is processed anonymously; we don’t identify anyone. We use it to improve our website and give you a better browsing experience. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.Personal information (such as your name and email address) submitted through our contact us page or chat function may be used to provide you with information you’ve requested, send information we think may be of interest to you, promote services we think you may find helpful, and meet any legal requirements we have towards you.Sharing personal informationWe never sell your personal information to any third party.Where appropriate, we may share your data with certified Sales Partners and VARs in order to give you information you have requested or may find of interest, or to provide you with improved customer service.We post customer testimonials on our website, which may include personal information.

Because the servers that receive your requests for web pages have no way of knowing specifically who is making a request, they have no way of storing settings for specific users or changing the page they send based on choices a user has made on another page.Cookies solve this problem by saving settings on your (the user’s) system. When your browser requests a page, it sends the settings that apply to that page along with the request. Because your browser will only send the settings back to the server that originally created them, cookies are a very secure way of maintaining data that is specific to a particular user.Cookies can also be used to help save and retrieve usernames used on our site and other preferences.
