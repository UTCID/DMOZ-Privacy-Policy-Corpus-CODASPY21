ClaimsAny claim for shipping shortages, shipping refunds for late delivery or shipping errors must be made within 5 days of the delivery.  If there is a shipping shortage, the box must be kept for carrier inspection. Discarding the box will waive rights to a claim.
Any claim for non-receipt of a package must be made within 30 days of the order being placed.
Cancellations and Refused OrdersCancellations, refused orders (not accepted by the purchaser from the delivery service) and undeliverable orders (incorrect address) on any product already shipped will be treated as a return and incur the re-stocking fees. Refused orders will also be responsible for shipping costs. Orders over $500, custom orders (orders for products in any other way than they are stocked) are not cancelable.
Order ChangesWe are not able to change orders once they are placed.  Sometimes, in an emergency case, we can do it; but it is never guaranteed.  Due to our consolidated shipping, multiple pickups throughout the day and dependence on proper ordering, we can only guarantee to try to change the order (in an emergency instance.)
Payment MethodsWe take Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover,  Visa debit and MC debit cards as well. If the credit card declines, we will send an email and retry the charge daily until cancelled. Please check your email for any messages and make sure to respond.Minimum Style quantitiesEach style has a minimum order quantity specific to that style only.  It does not accept mixing with other styles.  The ordering system will only allow entries for that quantity or higher.Minimum OrdersUSA minimum order:  $100.00 USDExport Order Minimums: $250.00 USDShipping AddressFor new customers (customers purchasing less than 90 days,) we can only ship to the address where the credit card bill comes to. In some circumstances, an alternate address can be added to the credit where we may be able to verify this with the credit card company, but we would need to be notified by this at the time of placing the order. If 2 addresses are filled into the shipping address during checkout (for example a PO Box and a street address,) we may correct it to the one which the credit card company verifies. If you are a new customer and enter a different address other than your credit card address in the shipping address area of the checkout section, it may delay order processing and may cause additional communication. We verify the address on every order with the credit card company.If shipping to a hotel or special address where the customer will only be there for a short period and the package is delivered later than expected, then the customer is responsible for obtaining the later delivered package whether keeping or returning it as long as it was shipped using the correct level of service.Shipping

If it is not, then it may take a few days before shipping. Once the product is available, we can ship the method that you choose. For example, choosing "overnight" as a option, will have the product shipped that business day overnight. However, if the item(s) are not in stock, then, it will ship overnight once they are in stock. If the shipping method that you choose is not available for your address, we will change the shipping method to the closest type that which is available for your address. Shipping carrier address correction and address change charges are the responsibility of the customer and will be charged accordingly.Most shipping services do not deliver on the weekends and many national holidays and also does not count those days as transit days.

You will also see a padlock symbol or key in the bottom bar of your browser.  In addition, our system is tested daily for any vulnerabilities.
Additional Security and Fraud ProtectionSecurity checks: As part of our policy to protect against the fraudulent use of credit cards, we carry out random security checks on orders. These can take various forms, and from time to time it may be necessary for us to ask you to provide a copy of a recent statement header for the card being used on your order. Please note that we are only interested in confirming information already provided on your order, i.e. the billing name and address and card issuer details, and do not need to see actual transactions, which can be covered up. In case you have any concerns regarding security, we can also assure you that all information is shredded as soon as we have confirmed the details required. We hope you appreciate that this is undertaken in the interests of fraud prevention, and is a necessary precaution.
