Independence Holding Company, also commonly referred to as The IHC Group (IHC), including its companies Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York, Independence American Insurance Company, Madison National Life Insurance Company, Inc., and affiliates respect your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access and use through our compliance with this policy.
This policy describes the personal information that we may collect from you, or that you may provide on any subsidiary website of IHC, and how that information may be used or disclosed by IHC.
This policy does not apply to information we collect through any other means, or to information collected on any other company, its affiliate or third-party site or by any third-party application that may be linked to or be accessible from the website.
Please read the following carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it. By using or accessing our website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time and your continued use of the website is deemed to be acceptance of such changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
Information Collected
We collect personal information (for example, name, address, email address) on our websites when you voluntarily provide it to us or when you navigate through the sites, including usage details, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons. Only your domain is recognized when you visit our websites; your individual e-mail address is not.  We may collect personal information from third parties such as our business partners. We do not sell or rent information about our customers to others.
Sources of Your Information
We collect information from the following sources:
Information we collect through our websites, which includes, but is not limited to, usage details, IPA addresses, cookies, web beacons and web bugs.
Information that you provide on quote requests or applications or other forms which may require some or all of the following: your name, address, email address, telephone number and Social Security number.
Information from your transactions with us, our affiliated companies or our business partners. This includes products and services you have purchased from us or information about your payment history or claims.
Information we receive from your insurance broker. This may include updated information about your policy or account.
Information we receive from third parties, such as non-IHC owned business partners.
Sharing Information
In order to conduct our business and offer you the products and services that you may want, we may share your information as allowed or required by law. We may share your information with our affiliates or third parties outside of IHC to service, market or underwrite our products and services to you. We may share your information with insurance agents and brokers who sell our products and services. We may also share your information with companies that we have formal agreements with to sell our products and services.
Working with these businesses allows us to provide you with a broader selection of insurance and investment products and services from our companies. These businesses sign a contract with us to keep your information private and secure and to use it only for the services we request. If any sharing of your information would require us to give you the option to opt-out of or opt-in to the information sharing, we will provide you with this option.
Medical Information

The independent insurance agents and brokers who sell our products and services are not our employees and are not subject to our privacy policy. Contact your agent or broker to learn more about their privacy practices.
Keeping Your Personal Information Safe
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Please note that the information you share in public areas of the website, such as comments, may be viewed by any user of the website.

Browsers & Security
In some instances we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. SSL protects information as it crosses the Internet. You can tell if you are visiting a secure area by looking at the padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser screen. If it is “locked,” you have a secure session.
