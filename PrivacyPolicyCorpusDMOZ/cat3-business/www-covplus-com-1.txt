Testimonials
I have been using the Coverage Plus Insurance Agency, where Chris is the owner and broker. He is very knowledgeable and knows the insurance market well. Chris has always been recommending the best possible product for my situation, finding a great balance maximizing coverage and minimizing cost, without compromising integrity. Chris recommended an insurance company that puts the customer first, provide excellent service at a reasonable price AND is financially viable, which is very important these days. I would definitely recommend Chris and the Coverage Plus Insurance Agency for your insurance needs.
Jesper S
The first time Chris surprised me was when he achieved the unthinkable: obtaining reasonable cover at very affordable prices when I first moved to the US and had virtually no credit and driving history here (apparently, having driven for 25 years+ does not count).
Not content with that, he managed to improve coverage, at lower rates, as soon as was feasible – despite my having previously believed that “affordable coverage” and “Porsche” would never go into the same sentence.
Ever since, I’ve been assisted very promptly whenever I had a query / claim, and he’s definitely succeeded in making me feel like I’m his only client – which I very much trust not to be the case, as I wish him and Coverage Plus every success.
Marco M
After exhausting research and numerous phone calls with auto insurance companies, I was referred to Chris’s services by a friend. I got an email from Chris requesting a few details about myself and the car I needed insurance for, and shortly after replying to it, I received a very well priced quote with full coverage. With a few customizations I was able to get an awesome deal for literally half the price I was paying at the moment, I immediately called my current company and cancelled and switched to the policy Chris suggested. All of this was done over email within a few hours, I truly enjoyed doing business with Chris and definitely recommend anyone looking for a fast and easy way to get the best deals in auto insurance.
Nikhil I
Chris has taken care of all of my insurance needs for many years now. He is extremely knowledgeable and always considers the overall scenario before recommending a policy. My company switched to his recommendations on Corporate policies and we have saved quite a bit in premiums. I have referred Chris to clients many times and the result is consistent, Chris did a great job for us. I can recommend Chris without reservation.
Rick S
Chris works incredibly hard, is always available and consistently responded to me faster than anyone else I contacted. He is knowledgeable and optimizes cost and all factors. I have taken 3 policies from him in one year of knowing him.
Parnian K
I have known Chris Robinson for over ten years. He is a true professional. I would recommend Chris for any business endeavor that requires trust, character and integrity. I consider him a valued member of my business network as well as a dear and valued friend.
Scott M
I have been one of your clients for one year now.
I am writing you to express my appreciation for outstanding customer service Nora has always provided me during this time: Always prompt, courteous and extremely professional.
As I was in corporate sales for over 25 years (Cisco, Google, etc), I appreciate and value the high quality service your organization provides.
I am sure Nora's efficiency is a direct reflection of your leadership, so Congratulations Chris!
You guys can certainly count on me as a loyal and appreciative client.
