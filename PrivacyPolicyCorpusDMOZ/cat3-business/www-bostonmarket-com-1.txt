Welcome to the Boston Market Corporation Rotisserie Rewards program!
Effective Date: August 27, 2019
Last Updated: February 6, 2020
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE BOSTON MARKET CORPORATION ROTISSERIE REWARDS PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT ACCESS OR PARTICIPATE IN THE BOSTON MARKET® ROTISSERIE REWARDS™ PROGRAM.
Please note that these Terms of Use include an arbitration provision that governs any disputes between you and us. Unless you opt out as described in the arbitration provision below, this provision will:
-eliminate your right to a trial by jury; and substantially affect your rights, including preventing you from bringing, joining, or participating in class or consolidated proceedings.
These Terms of Use set forth the terms and conditions applicable to the Rotisserie Rewards program (sometimes hereinafter the “Program”). In these Terms of Use, “you,” “your,” or “member” refer to the person who has successfully registered for the Rotisserie Rewards program or who is an existing Rotisserie Rewards member. “We” or “us” refers to Boston Market Corporation, its participating licensees, and franchisees.
You agree that we may provide notices, disclosures, and amendments to these Terms of Use, and other information relating to the Rotisserie Rewards program by electronic means, including posting such information and materials online at https://www.bostonmarket.com/company/terms-and-conditions/.
These Terms of Use apply to your access to, and participation in, the Rotisserie Rewards program in the United States (“Rotisserie Rewards”), which is operated by Boston Market Corporation or its participating, licensees  (collectively, “Boston Market”). These Terms of Use do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Boston Market for other products or services, such as gift cards or catering. Boston Market reserves the right to change or modify these Terms of Use or any policy, FAQ, guideline, or rule pertaining to Rotisserie Rewards, in whole or in part, at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to https://www.bostonmarket.com/company/terms-and-conditions/, and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued access to or participation in Rotisserie Rewards following any such changes or modifications confirms your acceptance of these Terms of Use and such changes or modifications; therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and the policies, any FAQs, guidelines, and rules pertaining to Rotisserie Rewards often to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your access to and participation in Rotisserie Rewards. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you must stop accessing and participating in Rotisserie Rewards.
Rotisserie Rewards is intended for personal use only. Commercial use is prohibited. Rotisserie Rewards is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may access and participate in Rotisserie Rewards only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.
Please read the Privacy Statement on our website (www.bostonmarket.com) carefully to understand how Boston Market collects, uses and discloses information about customers, how to update or change your personal information, and how we communicate with you.
Subject to these Terms of Use, and as a benefit of membership in the Rotisserie Rewards program (sometimes hereinafter the “Program”), when you register for the Rotisserie Rewards Program, you may earn and redeem rewards points at participating Boston Market restaurants, subject to these Terms of Use.
Your registration for Rotisserie Rewards program and/or continued membership in that rewards program, or any prior rewards program offered by Boston Market Corporation, indicates your acceptance of and agreement to all of these Program Terms and Conditions, including, without limitation, the arbitration provision in Section 14 below. Be sure to check these Program Terms of Use located at www.bostonmarket.com for updates, as your continued membership and/or participation in the Rotisserie Rewards Program signifies your acceptance of these Terms of Use as they exist from time to time, including, without limitation, any changed provisions.
1. ABOUT ROTISSERIE REWARDS
The Rotisserie Rewards program is one way that Boston Market seeks to reward loyal guests and thank them for patronizing our business. Rotisserie Rewards members in good standing are able to earn and accumulate “Market Points” that can be redeemed for Rotisserie Rewards benefits (sometimes referred to as “Rewards”) at participating Boston Market restaurants and are eligible to receive certain additional benefits. Unfortunately, not all Boston Market locations are able to award Market Points, or redeem Market Points for Rotisserie Rewards, at this time. Boston Market restaurants located on Army or Air Force bases or other military bases participate in the Rotisserie Rewards program, but Boston Market locations at Travel America sites do not presently participate, and so are not able to award or redeem Market Points or Rotisserie Rewards.
Visit www.bostonmarket.com and search for locations honoring “Rotisserie Rewards.” At present, Travel America locations do not participate in the Rotisserie Rewards program. Army and Air Force base locations are not listed on bostonmarket.com.
2. HOW TO JOIN ROTISSERIE REWARDS
To be eligible to join Rotisserie Rewards in accordance with these Terms of Use, you must register. The Rotisserie Rewards registration process may require that you provide the following information: first name, last name, username (your email address), password, mobile phone number, and zip code. If you want to participate in our birthday rewards, you must also provide your birth date. There are four (4) ways to join Rotisserie Rewards and begin accumulating Market Points:
Download the Boston Market mobile app to your Android™ or iPhone® device. Follow the prompts to create a Rotisserie Rewards account.
Go to bostonmarket.com and follow the prompts that show you how to sign up to earn points to create a Rotisserie Rewards account.
Go to a participating Boston Market restaurant. Provide your phone number to a cashier. You will then receive a text that will allow you to opt in. Fees may apply for texts. By participating, you agree to receive text messages from Boston Market.
Join Rotisserie Rewards through a special promotion, membership, or other program that may be offered by Boston Market and/or our business partners. There may be additional terms and conditions applicable to these promotions and programs, so please read them carefully.
Your Rotisserie Rewards username(s) and password(s), and Rotisserie Rewards account(s), are for your personal use only. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your Rotisserie Rewards username(s) and password(s), Rotisserie Rewards program account(s), and profile information (including registered email address and phone number), and you agree to be responsible for all activities that occur with any of the foregoing or otherwise in connection with the Program. Neither Boston Market nor its respective service providers are responsible for use of any of the foregoing without your permission.
3. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
You will not begin accumulating Market Points until the registration process is complete and verified. Incomplete accounts, or non-working email addresses or cell phone numbers, may disqualify you from participating in the Rotisserie Rewards program.
Each Rotisserie Rewards account may be associated with only one email address. If a Rotisserie Rewards member creates two (2) accounts, and each account has its own email address, Market Points and Rotisserie Rewards in one account cannot be merged with, or transferred to, another account with any other Rotisserie Rewards account having a different email address. In other words, if you set up a second (or more) account(s) ,and each account has its own email address, these accounts cannot be merged, combined with, transferred to, or in any way shared between, one another, or otherwise counted toward Market Points or Rotisserie Rewards for any account with a different email address. For example, if you set up a Rotisserie Rewards account with your personal email address, and also set up a second Rotisserie Rewards account with a different email address, including but not limited to your work email address, the Market Points, and/or Rotisserie Rewards, that you earn for each account stay only with that particular account, and may not be transferred, merged, or combined with your other account(s).
The Rotisserie Rewards program operates only in the contiguous 48 states of the United States.
4. EARNING ROTISSERIE REWARDS
The Rewards that are available to you through Rotisserie Rewards are based on the number of Market Points that you earn. You can earn Market Points by making purchases at participating Boston Market restaurants in the United States.
You will earn Market Points based on the value of your purchase (after any discounts and coupons applied and before taxes) at the rate of one (1) Market Point for each one U.S. Dollar ($1.00) you spend at participating Boston Market restaurants. Qualifying Catering Purchases (defined below) will earn one (1) Market Point for every one U.S. Dollar ($1.00) you spend. Market Points may only be earned in whole dollars (no fractions or portions of a dollar). For example, if you spend $9.99 (nine dollars and 99 cents) at a participating Boston Market for a qualifying purchase, you will get nine (9) Market Points. If you spend $10.01, you will get ten (10) Market Points.
A Qualifying Catering Purchase is a purchase of catering services offered by Boston Market which meets certain criteria. In order to qualify for Market Points, the purchase must be made one of two ways: 1 – either through order.bostonmarket.com (eMarket); or 2 – though a designated Boston Market employee who may place orders through order.bostonmarket.com. These employees are currently identified as Catering Sales Specialists. In addition, no catering purchase made pursuant to a contract, agreement, or understanding between a third party and Boston Market for catering services at special or discounted pricing will accumulate Market Points, no matter how the order is placed. In addition, Boston Market is not responsible for any prohibition by any person’s s employer or other entity that may prohibit or restrict that person’s right or ability to have or accumulate Market Points; to accumulate Market Points in any particular account; or to disclose the existence of Market Points. Boston Market reserves the right to not reward Market Points to, or to remove Market Points from the account of, any person who fails to follow the above requirements for a Qualifying Catering Purchase, or who Boston Market becomes aware has violated these requirements, and/or to change the definition of a Qualifying Catering Purchase at any time. By participating, or attempting to participate, in Rotisserie Rewards, you acknowledge, agree, and consent to such actions by Boston Market.
Subject to these Terms of Use, an eligible member whose Rotisserie Rewards Program account is in good standing may earn one (1) point per one U.S. Dollar ($1.00) spent on eligible purchases at participating locations in the contiguous 48 United States and the District of Columbia. Eligible purchases are limited to all in-store transactions (excluding past purchases, catering purchases, and purchases of gift cards and gift certificates). Points are earned only on the actual amount paid by a member in an eligible transaction (after any applicable discounts and before taxes). Points are earned only on whole dollar purchases and not partial dollar purchases, and a partial dollar purchase will not be rounded up to the next dollar (for example, a $1.15 purchase would earn only one (1) point). Points, if previously earned, will be deducted by Boston Market, in its sole discretion, for returns, cancelled orders, chargebacks, and other circumstances affecting an applicable transaction. Purchases at nonparticipating locations, taxes, and delivery orders placed through third parties, such as UberEats and DoorDash are not eligible. Market Points will not be earned on charitable donations. Participating locations are subject to change in Boston Market’s sole discretion without notice.
To earn Rewards based on making eligible purchases (earning Market Points), you must “check in” at the point of sale at a participating Rotisserie Rewards location prior to completing your purchase. You may also text “Boston” to 67794. You will then receive an opt-in text message. If you opt in, you will receive a second text with a link to a Rotisserie Rewards sign-up page. Ordinary carrier fees may apply to all text messages.
To redeem points for a Reward when you are a Rotisserie Rewards member, you must select an eligible Reward within your Rotisserie Rewards Program account on the applicable Boston Market app or online at my.bostonmarket.com. You must have the correct number of points available in your Rotisserie Rewards Program account for the selected points Reward.
5. REDEEMING REWARDS
In order to redeem a Reward, you must select the Reward that you want to use before you arrive at the point of sale, and place that Reward (or Rewards) in the “My Rewards” section of your account. You can place a Reward in your “My Rewards” wallet by selecting that particular Reward on my.bostonmarket.com or on the applicable Boston Market mobile app and agreeing to exchange points for that Reward. You may then select from the Rewards in your wallet at the point of sale.
At the time of selection of a Reward, your selected Reward will be posted to your applicable Rotisserie Rewards account, and your Rotisserie Rewards points balance will be reduced by the number of Market Points redeemed for that Reward. Once made, a Reward selection is not subject to change, substitution, or reversal by a member.
To redeem a Reward, visit an applicable participating Boston Market restaurant and “check in” at the point of sale as described above, or log into your Rotisserie Rewards account on my.bostonmarket.com or on the Boston Market mobile app and place an online or app order. Your Reward will be removed from your Rotisserie Rewards account at the time of use. All Rewards expire thirty (30) days after posting to your Rotisserie Rewards account, and if a selected Rotisserie Reward expires without redemption, the associated points used to select the Reward will not be reinstated to your Rotisserie Rewards account.
You may only redeem one (1) Reward per visit, which you may choose at the point of sale. A Reward may only be redeemed for the purchase of that selected Reward. Redemption of a Reward will not earn Market Points. If you redeem a Reward for part of a transaction, and buy other menu items, the Reward redemption portion of your purchase is not eligible for Market Points.
If you have no activity on your Rotisserie Rewards account for six (6) months, the Market Points in your Program account (no matter when they were earned) will expire and will no longer be available for redemptions. “Activity” is defined as making a food or drink purchase eligible for Market Points, or a Reward redemption at a participating Boston Market restaurant, through the Boston Market app, or through order.bostonmarket.com using your Rotisserie Rewards account. Rotisserie Rewards accounts may not be combined. If there is no activity (as defined above) on your Rewards account for six (6) months or more, you will continue to be a member of the Rotisserie Rewards program, but your Market Point balance for the Program will be reduced to zero and any activity will restart your Reward account again at zero points.
Rewards may not be substituted (except by an applicable participating Boston Market restaurant, in that restaurant’s sole discretion). Redemption of Rewards is based upon availability of the particular Reward in the applicable Rewards location at which you redeem your Reward, and you cannot substitute another type of Reward for a selected but unavailable Reward. A Reward must be redeemed in a single transaction, and any unused portion of a Reward is forfeited, for which no consideration will be given. Partial redemption of Rewards is not allowed (for example, if a single Reward was two fountain drinks (such a Reward may not actually exist), that Reward must be redeemed in a single transaction and visit; you could not break you the Reward to redeem a single fountain drink on two separate visits and transactions. In the event of any dispute, Boston Market’s determination of the size or quantity of the Reward shall be final.
Market Points and unused earned Rewards (if you have any) will be identified on your account page accessible by logging into your Rewards account on the Rotisserie Rewards App or website (my.bostonmarket.com). Your points and Rewards shall be as reflected in Boston Market’s records, unless you can prove otherwise to Boston Market’s satisfaction.
Rewards are subject to change, elimination, or substitution at any time at Boston Market’s sole discretion without notice. Market Points and Rewards (a) have no cash value; (b) may not be redeemed or exchanged for cash or any cash equivalent; (c) may not be combined with other offer, promotion, discounts, or coupons (including, without limitation, any other Points Reward or Program Reward); (d) are not transferable; and (e) may not be substituted (except by a participating Boston Market restaurant, in its sole discretion). Redemptions of Rewards do not earn Market Points. You are not obligated to accept or redeem any Rewards. Rewards will be deemed forfeited without notice if not used within the allotted time frame, and the associated points used to select the Reward will not be reinstated to your Program account.
6. PROMOTIONAL BONUS MARKET POINT OFFERS
From time to time, we, or others acting with our permission, may offer you special promotions that offer you additional Market Points. The promotional Market Points, if any, will be awarded as described in the applicable promotional offer, and will be subject to any additional terms and/or conditions set forth in such promotional offer.
7. PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS
Eligible customers may, at times, earn Market Points through participation in programs offered by our business partners. For example (meant as illustration only and not an actual offer), “Buy any Coca-Cola fountain product and get double Market Points for your purchase.” (NOTE – The preceding is meant only as an example. Actual promotions, if any, may vary, and are at the sole discretion of Boston Market.) Boston Market does not operate and is not responsible for these programs, which have separate and additional terms and conditions governing how Market Points may be earned.
8. EXCLUSIONS TO EARNING MARKET POINTS
There may be certain types of promotional programs that do not offer Market Points. In addition, you cannot earn Market Points on non-qualifying purchases, including, but not limited to, purchases of Give Kids The World coupon books or of Boston Market gift cards or (such as activations, reloads, transfers, and other card-to-card transactions). Taxes, tips, donations, and fees, including without limitation, delivery fees, and any fees charged by any delivery partner are excluded and ineligible for Market Point accrual.
9. WHEN MARKET POINTS ARE ADDED TO YOUR ROTISSERIE REWARDS ACCOUNT
Generally, Market Points are automatically added to your Rotisserie Rewards account within twenty-four (24) hours of when you earned them (i.e., the date and time on your receipt) with a qualifying purchase  If you believe that Market Points were not added to your Rewards account in a timely manner, you may  submit your original receipt information for review and verification at www.bostonmarket.com/rotisserie-rewards, your receipt should be submitted more than twenty-four hours (based on the time and date on your receipt) after your qualifying purchase, but within fourteen (14) calendar days of that purchase.  You must wait twenty-four hours after your qualifying purchase or your request will not be accepted by our system. Boston Market will then review your request, but reserves the right to decline to add Market Points to an account for any non-qualifying purchase, or portion thereof, or should Boston Market be unable to verify the purchase in its sole discretion, or reasonably doubt the validity of the request for any reason. Note that there may be a delay in adding Market Points earned and accepted through receipt verification to your Rotisserie Rewards account. Market Points earned and accepted through receipt verification are generally added to your Rotisserie Rewards account within 3-5 business days from when you complete the receipt submission at www.bostonmarket.com/rotisserie-rewards. Boston Market allows guests to submit their receipt for Market Points a maximum of ten (10) times total over the life of that guest account. Guest receipts submitted beyond that number, or not submitted within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date and time of the qualifying purchase (as reflected on your receipt) are not and will not be eligible for Market Points. This is so whether the request to add the Market Points is made online or through any other medium. Be sure to give your phone number at the time you place your order to make sure you get your Market Points for all qualifying purchases. In the case of a dispute between records, Boston Market’s internal records shall be deemed dispositive of the time and date of a qualifying order.
If you void a purchase made that resulted in an award of Market Points, or if a purchase is refused by a credit card company, or charged back, or if a purchase made with a check results in an award of Market Points and the check is subsequently dishonored, Boston Market will deduct any Market Points that you earned for that purchase from your Rotisserie Rewards balance, potentially resulting in a zero Market Point balance on your Rewards account. If you return menu items purchased and for which Market Points had been awarded, the Market Points awarded as a result of that purchase will be deducted from your Market Points total. Purchases made with Boston Market gift cards accrue Market Points, but purchases of Boston Market gift cards do not.
If you use multiple forms of payment in one transaction, such as cash, credit card, or a Boston Market gift card or other stored value card (for example, a Visa® or American Express® gift card), you will receive Market Points associated with that purchase.
10. MARKET POINT EXPIRATION
Market Points accrued in your Rotisserie Rewards account expire after one hundred eighty (180) days of no activity on your account—that is, if you have not made a purchase or not redeemed a reward at a participating Boston Market location using your Rotisserie Rewards account within 180 days. For example, if your last qualifying purchase was on January 1, 2020, all your Market Points will expire on June 29, 2020, unless you make a qualifying purchase using your Rotisserie Rewards account before June 29.To make a purchase using your Rotisserie Rewards account, provide your phone number or email address at the register when ordering in restaurant, provide your account phone number or email address when ordering over the phone with a catering specialist, or log into your account to order online at my.bostonmarket.com, order.bostonmarket.com, or on the Boston Market mobile app. . If you have a Rotisserie Rewards account and have opted in to receive marketing email communications, you will receive an email when your Market Points are 30 days and 7 days away from expiring. The oldest accrued Market Points will be used first for redemptions. You can view and track your Market Point balance and available Rewards, as well as any additional benefits for which you are eligible as a Rotisserie Rewards member, on my.bostonmarket.com or by using the Boston Market mobile app.

14. ARBITRATION
Please read this “Arbitration” section carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of through court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. It replaces the right to go to court. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.
Binding Arbitration. This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, your access to or participation in Rotisserie Rewards, the Market Points accumulated in Rotisserie Rewards account, or your relationship with us. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, your access to or participation in Rotisserie Rewards, or your relationship with Boston Market or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.
Opt-Out. Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if you opt out of this arbitration provision within thirty (30) days from the date you registered for a Rotisserie Rewards account or accumulated Market Points, whichever date occurs earlier (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by sending us a written notice that you opt out to the following address: Boston Market Rotisserie Rewards, Guest Services Department, Boston Market Corporation, 14103 Denver West Pkwy., Golden, CO 80401. Any opt out received after the Opt-Out Deadline (allowing three (3) additional days for mailing) will not be valid, and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.
Arbitration Procedures. For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your claim to our Guest Services department to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days.
The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA“), including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org.

Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.
Costs of Arbitration. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial $200 filing fee, and for claims of less than $1,000, Boston Market will reimburse you for the filing fee within 30 days of receiving a written request from you. Each party will bear the fees and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration. However, for claims under $10,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we will not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.
Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver. You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this class action waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out procedure set forth above.
