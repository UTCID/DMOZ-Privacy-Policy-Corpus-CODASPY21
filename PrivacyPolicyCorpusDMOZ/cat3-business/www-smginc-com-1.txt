As part of the process for submitting your personal information, we may use that information for several general purposes: to tell users about products, seminars and services if users or a user’s organization so request, to fulfill such a request, to contact users if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records, and to contact users regarding customer satisfaction surveys.
A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web site transfers to a computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or network when you are on the internet. When you respond to the Application, our servers log your IP address. BTS may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, system administration, and audits of our Application. We may also use IP addresses in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement agencies to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with law, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or this Application’s Terms of Use, or to protect the Application or its users and visitors. Application usage information may be used by us to determine the applicable technology available in order to serve the visitor the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or other similar services.
Our web sites may contain links to information on other web sites. We do not have any control over these other web sites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that is provided while visiting those sites.
