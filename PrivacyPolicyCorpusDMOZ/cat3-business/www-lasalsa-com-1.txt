It applies to your access to, and use of, any of our websites, mobile applications, and online services or programs where this Privacy Policy is posted or linked (collectively, "Online Services").

The La Salsa® Franchise System
The La Salsa® franchise system is a restaurant network made up of company-operated, franchised, and licensed La Salsa® restaurant businesses. La Salsa® franchisees ("Franchised Operators" or "Operators") own and operate their own individual franchised businesses. La Salsa® licensees ("Licensees") are granted a license to use La Salsa®'s trade name and marks in the sale of La Salsa® products at La Salsa® licensed locations. Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee, or to any La Salsa® operations outside of the United States. Please see the Franchised Operator and Licensee Online Services section below for more information regarding a Franchised Operator's or Licensee's applicable policies.
