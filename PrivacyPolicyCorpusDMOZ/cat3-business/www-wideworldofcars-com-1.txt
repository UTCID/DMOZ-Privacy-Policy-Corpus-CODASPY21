Legal Disputes and Choice of LawDISPUTE RESOLUTION - MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERARBITRATION AGREEMENT. YOU AND NEW COUNTRY AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ("Claims") THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THS SITE, OR ANY SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BILLING DISPUTES), SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury. Instead, Claims are decided by an arbitrator whose authority is created by and governed by this arbitration agreement. Review of arbitration awards in the courts is very limited.CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND NEW COUNTRY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. WE BOTH AGREE THAT THERE WILL BE NO CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS IN ARBITRATION. In addition, neither you nor New Country may participate in a class or representative action in court as a class member if the claims asserted in the litigation would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if asserted directly by you or New Country. To be clear, you and New Country both waive any right to participate in any class action involving disputes between us.This class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and may not be severed. If for any reason this class action waiver is found unenforceable, then the entire arbitration agreement will not apply. However, the Jury Trial Waiver set forth below in these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.ARBITRATOR AUTHORITY: The arbitrator's authority is governed by this arbitration agreement. You and New Country agree that the arbitrator may award the same relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award - consistent with and limited by these Terms of Use (including the limitations of liability set forth herein), but the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief that extends beyond you and your dealings with New Country. An arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party if a court would be authorized to do so under the applicable law.ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: You and New Country agree that your agreement affects interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies. All arbitrations shall be conducted by JAMS Endispute under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS"). These Rules are available on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1.800.352.5267. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this arbitration agreement, then this arbitration agreement shall control. New Country will pay all filing fees and costs associated with commencing an arbitration, but you will be responsible for paying your own attorneys' fees (if you chose to use an attorney in arbitration) unless you prevail in the arbitration and the arbitrator finds that you are entitled to recover your fees under the law. The place of the arbitration will be at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The agreement formed by your consent to these Terms of Use has been made in, and will be construed in accordance with the laws of, the State of New York, without regard to its choice of laws rules. SURVIVAL: This arbitration agreement survives the termination of this Visitor Agreement between you and New Country.JURY TRIAL WAIVER.You and New Country expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. This means that if for any reason the arbitration agreement contained in Section 8 is not enforced or is found inapplicable, our claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.Violations of Website Terms of UseIn the event you violate or attempt to violate any part of these Terms of Use, New Country reserves the right to terminate your access to this Site immediately, at our sole discretion, with or without notice of any kind. We also reserve the right to involve and cooperate with law enforcement agencies, and to pursue a civil lawsuit or criminal prosecution for any and all alleged or actual illegal activities involving the Site.IndemnificationYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless New Country from and against any and all claims, proceedings, damages, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), relating to your use of the Site that leads to any claim against us by a third-party, regardless of the nature of the cause of action or claim.Severability and IntegrationIn the event any part of these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect. You understand and agree that these Terms of Use represent the entire agreement governing your use of the Site.Reservation of RightsAny and all rights not expressly granted to you in this Legal Notice and this Website Terms of Use are hereby reserved by New Country. This Site is intended for use only by citizens of the United States of America (excluding unincorporated territories, Puerto Rico and Guam), eighteen (18) years of age or older, who have the capacity to enter into a valid contract; by accessing this website, you represent and affirm that you meet these requirements.MinorsIn compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, New Country does not knowingly or intentionally solicit or collect information from minors, and our marketing is not directed at minors. If we determine that a user is under eighteen (18) years of age and has submitted information by way of our website without parental or legal guardian's consent, we will immediately delete such information.Procedure for Alleging Copyright InfringementIf you are an owner of intellectual property who believes your intellectual property has been improperly posted or distributed via the Site, please notify us by sending a notice by U.S. Mail to: New Country Motor Car Group, 358 Broadway, Suite 400, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866, Attn: Legal Department/Copyright.
