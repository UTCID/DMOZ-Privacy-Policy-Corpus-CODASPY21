It is DBS's policy not to share that information outside its organization without your knowledge or consent. A technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so that the DBS server can recognize you when you return.
