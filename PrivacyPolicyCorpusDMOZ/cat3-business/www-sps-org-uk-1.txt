For SPS Fellows, in addition to these opportunities, ASP provides a private platform to engage in conversation and debate, as well as to collaborate and connect with other Fellows. Through ASP's preferred university partnership program, SPS Fellows also can "give back" to budding business strategists through lectures and supporting university-backed research on best practices for strategy development and strategy execution. Further, Fellows can publish work through ASP’s
Strategy Magazine and contribute to ASP’s Body of Knowledge (BOK).
All ASP Members can contribute strategy content in ASP’s monthly newsletter, The Strategic Edge, as well as propose ideas for ASP’s monthly Global Webinar program, propose to speak at ASP chapter events and ASP’s annual conference.

SPS was formed in 1967 as an international network of strategists, dedicated to the development of strategic thinking, strategic management and strategic leadership. They have been a major force in promoting strategic thinking and action both in the private and public sectors. Their Mission is to improve the practice, development and recognition of strategic management. Their Vision is of a dynamic, global strategic management community.
ASP traces its history back to the early 1950's. After much planning and several name changes, the association in its current format began in 1999. Today, we have a growing worldwide footprint dedicated to advancing strategic leadership, thinking, planning and action. Learn more about the history of ASP here.
SPS bestows an exclusive honorary designation, "Strategic Planning Fellow," for those that have considerable experience and expertise in the profession. If you're interested in becoming a Fellow, please contact us at certification@strategyassociation.org. Please note, you must be a member of ASP to receive and maintain your Fellow status.
