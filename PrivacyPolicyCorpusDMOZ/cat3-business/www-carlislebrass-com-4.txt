20.6 Any waiver by the Seller of a breach of any of the terms of the Contract or of any default under the Contract shall not be deemed a waiver by the Seller of any subsequent breach or default and shall not affect the other terms of the Contract.
20.7 A person who is not a party to the Contract (a "third party") shall have no rights pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the "Act") to enforce any of these Conditions. Any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available apart from the Act is not affected.
20.8 The parties agree that any disputes arising or in any way connected with the subject matter of the Contract (whether of a contractual or tortious nature or otherwise) shall be subject to the laws of England and in the case of proceedings issued against the Seller shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts only.
20.9 We will make a search and/or enquiry with credit reference agencies (“CRAs”), who will give us information about you, such as about your financial history, and who will keep a record of that search and will share that information with other businesses. We will do this to assess creditworthiness, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will monitor and record information relating to your trade performance and will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. CRAs will share this information with other organisations. For Credit Circle members, we will record information relating to your trade credit performance and such records will be made available to other organisations to access applications for credit.
20.10 To the extent any personal data is collected or processed under or in connection with these Conditions, such personal data shall be collected or processed in accordance with applicable law and the Sellers privacy policy (and where applicable cookies policy) located at www.carlislebrass.com.
