DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
PLEASE READ THIS FOLLOWING CLAUSE CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
a. Initial Dispute Resolution: LeSportsac is available by email at custsrv@lesportsac.com  to address any concerns you may have regarding the use of the Website or your purchase from LeSportsac.  Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.  Each of you and LeSportsac agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
b. AGREEMENT TO BINDING ARBITRATION: IF THE PARTIES DO NOT REACH AN AGREED UPON SOLUTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE TIME INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION IS PURSUED AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THEN ANY REMAINING CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, YOUR PURCHASE FROM LESPORTSAC OR THESE TERMS OF SERVICE SHALL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE JAMS IN A LOCATION DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR AS SET FORTH HEREIN (PROVIDED THAT SUCH LOCATION IS REASONABLY CONVENIENT FOR CLAIMANT), OR AT SUCH OTHER LOCATION AS MAY BE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURAL RULES FOR COMMERCIAL DISPUTES SET FORTH IN THE COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OF JAMS (“JAMS RULES AND PROCEDURES”) THEN PREVAILING, AND JUDGMENT UPON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE ARBITRATOR, AND NOT ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL COURT OR AGENCY, SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION, APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR FORMATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THESE TERMS OF USE ARE UNLAWFUL, VOID OR VOIDABLE. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE EMPOWERED TO GRANT WHATEVER RELIEF WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN A COURT UNDER LAW OR IN EQUITY.
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, IN LIGHT OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION, THEY ARE WAIVING THEIR RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE THEIR DISPUTES RESOLVED BY A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL.
THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE SELECTED PURSUANT TO THE JAMS RULES AND PROCEDURES. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL APPLY NEW YORK LAW CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND SHALL HONOR CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE RECOGNIZED AT LAW. IN THE EVENT THAT THE CLAIMANT IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION WILL BE PROHIBITIVE AS COMPARED TO THE COSTS OF LITIGATION, LESPORSAC WILL PAY AS MUCH OF THE CLAIMANT’S FILING AND HEARING FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARBITRATION AS THE ARBITRATOR DEEMS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ARBITRATION FROM BEING COST-PROHIBITIVE. IF ANY PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS DEEMED TO BE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL (OTHER THAN THAT CLAIMS WILL NOT BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS), OR OTHERWISE CONFLICTS WITH THE JAMS RULES AND PROCEDURES, THEN THE BALANCE OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS AS IF THE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE, ILLEGAL OR CONFLICTING PROVISION WERE NOT CONTAINED HEREIN. IF, HOWEVER, THE PORTION THAT IS DEEMED INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL IS THAT CLAIMS WILL NOT BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID, AND NEITHER CLAIMANT NOR LESPORTSAC SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTE.
c. CLASS ACTION AND CLASS ARBITRATION WAIVER: YOU AND LESPORTSAC EACH FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND YOU AND LESPORTAC EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.  THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED. IF ANY COURT OR ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS VOID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON OR THAT AN ARBITRATION CAN PROCEED ON A CLASS BASIS, THEN THE ARBITRATION PROVISION SET FORTH ABOVE IN SECTION (B) SHALL BE DEEMED NULL AND VOID IN ITS ENTIRETY AND THE PARTIES SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE NOT AGREED TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND SUCH CLASS ACTION SHALL PROCEED CONSISTENT WITH SECTION (f) BELOW.
d. Exception – Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
e. 30 Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections (b) and (c) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email: custsrv@lesportsac.com  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your use the Website or your purchase from LeSportsac, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, LeSportsac also will not be bound by them.
