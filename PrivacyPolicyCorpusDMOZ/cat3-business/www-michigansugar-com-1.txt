ACCOUNTS, PASSWORDS, SECURITY AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION.
ONLINE ACCOUNT ACCESS.  Certain features and portions of this Site (the “Grower Site”) are accessible only to MSC’s members, non-member growers, and certain other authorized business partners (collectively, “Account Holders“).  The Grower Site is available by clicking on the Grower Access login at https://www.michigansugar.com/member/login.php.  Each Account Holder must establish an Account (“Account”), and designate individuals to receive restricted or unrestricted access to its Account (each, an “Authorized User”).  You may begin the enrollment process by enroll by sending an email to login@michigansugar.com or by calling (989) 686-1549, ext. 210.  In these Terms and Conditions, “you” and “your” includes each Account Holder and all of its Authorized Users.  You may never use another person’s Account or UserID without permission.  It is your responsibility to notify MSC if an Authorized User should no longer be given access to an Account through the Grower Site.
USER NAME AND PASSWORD. To be issued a unique user identification name (“UserID“) and password, each Account Holder and its Authorized Users must provide personally-identifiable or account-specific authentication information, and complete the registration process established by MSC.  MSC uses reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of UserIDs, passwords, and Accounts. However, each Account Holder is ultimately responsible for protecting its Account Information and the UserIDs and passwords for each of its Authorized users from disclosure to third parties.  Account Holders and Authorized Users may not circumvent MSC’s encryption technologies. You must take reasonable precautions to safeguard your UserID and password. You must not leave your computer unattended while using the Grower Site, and must always exit the Grower Site by clicking on “Log Out.”  You must immediately notify MSC of any unauthorized use of your UserID, password, or Account, or any other security breach by calling (989) 686-1549, ext. 210, by email at  login@michigansugar.com, or through the online message center (if applicable).
RELIANCE AND LIABILITY.  MSC may rely on each Authorized User’s UserID and password to identify the Authorized User.  MSC policies require Account Holders to electronically submit certain information and sign certain documents through the Grower Site, including without limitation certain crop records.  Each Account Holder must grant one or more Authorized Users authority to submit information and to electronically sign documents on the Account Holder’s behalf through the Grower Site.  MSC may rely upon the UserID and password of any such Authorized User as his or her electronic signature to sign any document and to authorize any transaction on Account Holder’s behalf.  Each Account Holder is legally bound by any document signed and all transactions and agreements entered into by those Authorized Users.  Each Account Holder must ensure that those Authorized Users submit all information that MSC requires to be electronically transmitted through the Grower Site, and is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of that information.  If any Authorized User permits another person to use the Grower Site or shares his or her UserID and/or password, the Account Holder is responsible for, and legally bound by, any information that person transmits and any document signed or transaction or agreement entered into using that UserID, even if the person exceeds the Account Holder’s authorization.
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION.  Each Authorized User may designate a primary email address that will be used for receiving electronic communication.  MSC may maintain an online message center, now or in the future.  You agree that MSC may communicate with you both by email at your primary email address and by communications through the online message center, as applicable.
