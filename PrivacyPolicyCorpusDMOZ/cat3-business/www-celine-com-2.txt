It is the express wish of the parties that these General Terms and Conditions of Use and all related documents be drawn up in English.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
In the event any litigation should arise between you and CELINE in any state or federal court in the United States in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND CELINE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. This Paragraph is subject to Paragraph 5 of the General Terms and Conditions of Use.
9. ADDITIONAL TERMS
Unless otherwise amended, these General Terms and Conditions of Use will exclusively govern your access to and use of the Website, and is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties, and supersedes any oral or written proposal, agreement or other communication between the parties, regarding your access to and use of the Website. You agree as it relates to our remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of these General Terms and Conditions of Use that CELINE shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relieve, or both, in addition to any damages that we may be legally entitled to recover. No right or remedy shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity. All waivers by CELINE hereunder must be in writing or later acknowledged by CELINE in writing. Any waiver or failure by CELINE to enforce any provision hereof on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver by CELINE of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision hereof is held to be unenforceable, that provision will be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law, replaced by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to the extent consistent with the law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. The prevailing party in any proceeding arising from or related to these General Terms and Conditions of Use will be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees, including costs and fees on appeal. You agree that each of CELINE’s service providers shall be considered a third party beneficiary of the above provisions, with all rights to enforce such provisions as if a service provider were a party hereto. None of your rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by you (in whole or in part and including by sale, merger, consolidation, or other operation of law) without the prior written approval of CELINE. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. CELINE may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any party that assumes CELINE’s obligations hereunder. The parties hereto are independent parties, not agents, employees or employers of the other or joint venturers, and neither acquires hereunder any right or ability to bind or enter into any obligation on behalf of the other. Any reference herein to “including” will mean “including, without limitation.”
