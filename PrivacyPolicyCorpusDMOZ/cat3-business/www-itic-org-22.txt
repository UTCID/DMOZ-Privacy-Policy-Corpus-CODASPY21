The tech sector is playing a critical role in promoting global energy efficiency and combating climate change. ITI and our members seek to continuously improve the energy efficiency landscape in the U.S. and globally to leverage energy-efficient technologies. ITI works on behalf of our member companies to advocate for policies that advance both intelligent efficiency and product efficiency.
ITI and our member companies understand that we have a major stake in the fight against climate change.
We have adopted three strategic commitments in this regard.
We also support government policies that emphasize an innovation agenda for mitigating and adapting our changing climate.
On energy efficiency, ITI unites the tech sector and the NGO community to advance policies that drive sustainable economic growth through technology-enabled energy and product efficiency innovation. ITI works proactively with the Environmental Protection Agency as an active partner in and advisor to the ENERGY STAR program.
Our activities in Europe in coordination with Digital Europe, our work in China in coordination with USITO and our policy efforts elsewhere in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. We also participate actively in energy efficiency efforts within the G-20, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the United Nations, and other international venues.
