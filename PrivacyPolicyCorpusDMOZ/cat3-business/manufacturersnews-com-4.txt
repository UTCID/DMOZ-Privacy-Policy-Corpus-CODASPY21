Your Rights Under CCPA
The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights regarding their Personal Information.
Right to Know / Disclosure
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we have received and verified your request, we will disclose, in accordance with your request:
• The categories or specific pieces of information we collected about you.
• The categories of sources from which your information was collected.
• The categories of third parties to whom we disclosed or sold your information.
• The categories of information that we disclosed or sold about you.
• Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or for selling your information.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information that we have collected and retained. Once we receive and verify such a request, we will delete your information from our records, unless retaining that consumer's information is necessary for us or for our service providers to:
• Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service which that consumer requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with that consumer, or otherwise perform our contract with that consumer.
• Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
• Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing or intended functionality.
• Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
• Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (California Penal Code § 1546).
• Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
• Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on their relationship with us.
• Comply with a legal obligation.
• Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which it was provided.
Right to Opt Out
You have the right to opt-out of sale of certain information subject to the CCPA by requesting that we do not sell your Personal Information. While MNI makes a good faith effort to accommodate opt-out requests, please note that when you exercise your right to opt-out, your request covers removing personal information that is on our systems at the time of the request. At present, we do not have an effective way to guarantee that information about you will not be rediscovered in another form or from a different source. If you find that your Personal Information has been rediscovered, please submit a new opt-out request.

To exercise any of your rights stated above, you may submit a request to us at:
MNI
Attention: Privacy
1633 Central Street
Evanston, IL 60201
Email Privacy
Only you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a request related to your Personal Information. The request must:
• Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
• Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are a resident of the state of California.
• Describe your request with sufficient details to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will not respond to your request or provide you with information if we are unable to verify your identity or authority to make the request. We will only use personal information provided in your request and any information provided to verify your identity in connection with the request, solely to process the request, keeping audit records, verify the requestor's identity and/or authority to make the request and for no other purpose.
You may only request for a copy of your data from MNI twice within a 12-month period.

We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of your request. If we cannot comply with the request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons for our inability to do so.
We will not charge a fee to process or respond to you request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will provide you with the reasons for our determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
