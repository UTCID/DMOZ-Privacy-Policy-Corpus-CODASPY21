We collect demographic information: We passively collect anonymous information. One manner of collecting such information is through cookies, which are small bits of data stored on your computer based on your Internet activity. You may configure your browser to reject cookies but, if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. We may use cookies, pixel tags, clear GIFs, Google Analytics or other third-party analytics and other similar technology. We use this information to measure the use of the Site and to improve the Site. This demographic information may include:
the referring domain name, your internet protocol (IP) addresses, your browser type, and your operating system type.
to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and other similar information
We may collect Credit Card Information: If you provide us with any credit card information, we use that information only accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS). You may be redirected to a third-party credit card processor, including, but not limited to, Pay Pal, Paymetric, Verisign, Oracle iStore, and Geo Trust. If you submit payment through any third-party processor or entity, you are subject to the third party's applicable privacy policy and terms of use.
How We Use Information (including PII) That We CollectWhen you provide us with PII, we may use that information to:
comply with legal requirements;

Do We Share Your Information With Third Parties?
We may share your PII and anonymous information for our businesses purposes and as legally permitted. For example, we may share:
With entities that perform functions on our behalf or in partnership with us. These third parties may have access to the information you have provided via the Site, including any PII, only to the extent it is necessary to perform their duties and functions for us. All such use will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Except for where you consent to a disclosure and for disclosed joint marketing arrangements, we do not market, sell or rent Pll to third parties.
We may disclose Pll for legal compliance purposes, to protect our companies, and in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose Pll in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to protect the confidentiality and security of our records pertaining to you, to limit our legal liability or to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
Within our family of companies. For example, we might share with one of our related companies, which include others in the Fortune Brands Home & Security family (see here for a list). If we do so, they will use your information as described in their own privacy policies.
Cross-Border TransfersWe may transfer Pll across country borders within our company (but at all times in compliance with this Privacy Policy). If you are located in the EU, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using this site or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer to the United States.
ChildrenThe Site is not directed at children, and we do not knowingly collect any Pll from children under thirteen years of age unless the collection complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). If we discover that a child under the age of thirteen (13) years has provided us with PII, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that child's Pll from our systems.
Links To Other Sites This Sitemay contain links to other sites, including but not limited to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. While we try to link only to reputable sites that respect your privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of other sites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us on this site and does not apply to third party sites.
How We Protect Your InformationWhile we have put in place measures that we deem reasonable to safeguard information that we collect from you, due to the nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee the security of any information on or transmitted over the Internet. As a result, we make no warranty regarding the security of any information you transmit to us via the Site and you do so at your own risk.
Policy ChangesWe reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event that we make a material change to our policy we may post a notice of the change on the Site. All changes and modifications to the Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date the modified Privacy Policy is posted on the Site. We will not use Pll in a manner materially different than as described in the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information was collected.
