Policy Issues
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property (IP) protections encourage the research and development (R&D) that drives innovation. Software accounts for 19.6 percent of all domestic business R&D in the United States. Proper IP protection frameworks are critical to maintaining this investment. BSA supports:
patent protection for all inventions on a technology-neutral basis,
copyright laws that protect the rights of authors, intermediaries, and users of works in the digital age,
protections for trade secrets, and
meaningful patent litigation reform that reduces opportunistic litigation and allows those who invent and innovate to thrive.
