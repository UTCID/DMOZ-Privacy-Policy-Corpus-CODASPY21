Our Commitment to Accessibility
Our commitment to our members inspires us to ensure accessibility for all our members. We take all reasonable actions to ensure all members have access to our services. We go above and beyond to ensure that the accessibility needs of differently abled members are accommodated with Dignity.*
Support persons and/or service animals
Our branch staff is educated and trained to accommodate our members with disabilities and welcome them to bring their service/guide animals or support/guide person on our premises while conducting business. It’s important to note that all actions will be taken keeping in mind our privacy policy.
Communication and Emergency notifications
Our staff is upskilled to communicate with people with disabilities, taking into account their disability.
Disruption of Services
We endeavour to notify our members as soon as possible in the event of a disruption of service, unexpected or planned. The branch manager(s) would be the point of contact for further information regarding such disruptions, including the cause of disruption and availability of alternative options. A notice informing about the disruption of service will be placed on the premises.
Customer Service Training
Accessibility training will be provided to all our employees to make sure that they understand how to effectively offer service to persons with disability. Such training will be provided during the probation period of each employee. Any update in the accessibility policy will be shared with all employees.

We strongly encourage our members to provide feedback if they wish to. The feedback could be regarding your experience with our accessibility services or a suggestion for improvement.
