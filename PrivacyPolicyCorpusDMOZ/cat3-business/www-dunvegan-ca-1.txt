The Dunvegan Group’s Privacy Policy
We take your online privacy seriously!
You don’t want your personal information in the wrong hands. Neither does
The Dunvegan Group.
When you visit The Dunvegan Group’s website, we may collect and store information
about your visit. This information may include the time and length of your visit, the pages
you look at on our site, and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We may also record
the name of your Internet Service Provider. We use this information to measure site activity and to
develop ideas for improving our site.
There are also several opportunities on our website for you to provide us with information about you and your
interests, such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address. If you choose to share any personal information
with us, we may store it and use it for marketing research and other marketing purposes, which may include sharing it
with other companies in The Dunvegan Group family and our business partners. We will NEVER sell your information to any
other company.
Some parts of our website may make use of “cookie” technology to measure site activity and to customize information to your personal tastes. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store the cookie on your hard drive. So, when you come back to visit us again, we can tailor information to suit your individual preferences. The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful visit.
You take online privacy seriously, and so does The Dunvegan Group. It’s our way of sustaining your trust in The Dunvegan Group and our services.
The Dunvegan Group reserves the right to alter our privacy principles as business needs require. Any alterations to these principles will be posted on our website in a timely manner.
