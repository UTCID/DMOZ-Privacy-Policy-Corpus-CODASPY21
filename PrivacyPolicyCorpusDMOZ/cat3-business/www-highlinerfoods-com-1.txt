If you specifically agree to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our mailing list when you signed up, we may also contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by clicking on "change" or "unsubscribe" on the "Investor Alerts" page or by emailing us at any time at info@highlinerfoods.com.

In the "Contact Us" section of this site, we ask for some personally identifiable information, such as your name, address and phone number.
