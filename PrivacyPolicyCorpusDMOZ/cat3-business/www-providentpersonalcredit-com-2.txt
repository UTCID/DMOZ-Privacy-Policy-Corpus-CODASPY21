How we use Fraud prevention agencies
General:1. Before we provide services, goods or financing to you, we undertake checks for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity. These checks require us to process personal data about you.2. The personal data you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have received from third parties will be used to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity.3. Details of the personal information that will be processed include, for example: name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details, device identifiers including IP address and vehicle details.4. We and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.5. We process your personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, in order to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.6. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.Automated Decisions:7. As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. You have rights in relation to automated decision making: if you want to know more please contact us using the details above.Consequences of Processing:8. If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have requested, or to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services to you.9. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details above.Data Transfers:10. Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to international frameworks intended to enable secure data sharing.
Processing your data for legal reasons
We will treat your information as private and confidential, but may share it with other Group companies and only disclose it outside the Group if we are legally obliged to do so or required to do so to satisfy a court order. Examples of this are:1. Passing information to HMRC (in the UK) and the revenue commissioners' (in the ROI) where a court order is in place.2. Required by the Police/Garda and other law enforcement agencies to investigate or prevent crime.3. Required by the authorities when we report on any suspicious activity that could indicate money laundering.4.Undertaking affordability reviews , where we will use all the data across the group companies to ensure we are fully aware of your Group commitments.5. Required to provide information to our industry regulators.
How we check your identity and undertake money laundering checks
We will undertake this processing to satisfy a legal obligation. Sometimes we will ask you to provide physical forms of identity when you take a product with us. This may include photo identification and a recorded video of yourself requesting a loan, so that we can see your face as part of the identification checks. Alternatively we may use information from the CRAs. This type of search is not seen or used by other lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.
Processing your data for contractual reasons
There are a number of activities that we will perform to either use your data to assess you for the product you have requested, to enable us to provide that product and to continue to administer it in line with the credit agreement you sign up to. Some examples of the contractual processing we undertake are;1. Undertaking credit searches to assess your suitability for a product, see below for further details.2. Assessing your application using an automated credit decisioning process, see below for further details.3. Sending regulatory communications such as annual statements.4. Affordability, to assess your ability to sustainably repay your loan, we may review your Income and Expenditure levels, based on data we hold, capture or you provide. 5. Recording the conversation we have with you when you apply for a new loan with us, to ensure we can evidence to our regulators that we are lending responsibly and in line with their requirements.
Using automated decision making - the logic involved and the consequences.
We will undertake this processing under a contractual requirement. When you apply for credit we use credit scoring.  This is or can be an automated system that helps us to understand behaviour and its impact on an individual's likelihood to pay their loan/credit commitments. Credit scoring will take account of information you provide on your application, information already held in the Provident Group about you, data from Credit reference agencies, data obtained from social media sites. Our credit scoring processes are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased. If you submit an application and it is declined through this automated process, you can contact us to have the decision reviewed.  If you need to contact us please email informationrequests@provident.co.uk, write to Rights Request Team, 1 Godwin Street, Bradford West Yorkshire BD1 2SU, or call 0800 9166278  and we will review your request and come back to you within 21 days.
How we use Credit Reference Agency data
We will undertake this processing under a contractual requirement. Your application will be registered on your credit report under the name Provident Personal Credit Limited and we are currently working with Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.
If you would like more information on these Credit Reference Agencies (CRA), please visit:
www.experian.co.uk/crain
www.equifax.co.uk/crain
www.transunion.co.uk/crain
We will undertake a search with at least one of these agencies when you apply for credit and this will review your records as well as anyone financially associated with you.
The agency will keep a record of this search and place a "footprint" on your file, whether or not your application proceeds.
Once you take a product with us, we will report regularly to the CRAs on your payment history. If you fall behind on your payments and satisfactory proposals are not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, then a notice may be recorded at the CRAs which could impact your ability to obtain further credit.
The information we and other organisations provide to the CRAs may be used by us and them to;
1) help make decisions when checking applications, managing credit related accounts and facilities, recovering debt, checking on insurance claims, checking job applications.2) detect and prevent money laundering, crime and fraud.3) verify identity.4) trace your whereabouts.5) check other credit applications you have made.6) undertake research, statistical analysis and system testing.7) assess your ability to repay your loan by looking at your income and expenditure levels.
Any records shared with the CRAs will remain on your CRA file for 6 years after your account is closed.
