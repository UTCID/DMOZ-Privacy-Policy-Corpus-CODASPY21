Please note that the revocation does not affect the legality of the previous data processing and that it does not extend to such data processing, for which there is a legal reason for permission and which therefore can be processed without your consent.
Further rights
In addition, you are entitled to the following rights according to Articles 15 to 21 and 77 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), subject to fulfilment of the relevant statutory requirements:
Information: You can request at any time that we disclose which personal data of yours we are using and provide you with a copy of your saved personal data, Article 15 GDPR.

Restriction of processing: Under certain circumstances you can request that the processing of your data be restricted, e.g. if you believe the data to be false, if their handling is unlawful or if you have registered an objection to their being processed. In this case, your data may only be processed without your consent in a highly restricted manner, for example, for the establishment, exercise and defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons, Article 18 GDPR.
Objection to processing of data: You have the option to object to data processing for direct marketing purposes at any time. In addition, if you have special reasons, you may at any time object to the data processing that takes place on the basis of a legitimate interest, Art. 21 DSGVO.
Data portability: You have the right to receive the data you have already provided us in an established and machine-readable format, and, as far as is technically possible, to request the direct transmission of this to a third party, Article 20 GDPR.
