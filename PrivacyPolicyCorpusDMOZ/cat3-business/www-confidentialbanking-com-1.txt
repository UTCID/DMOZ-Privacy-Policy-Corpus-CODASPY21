As the transfer of assets into a limited partnership, trust, corporation or other entity may constitute such a transaction within scope of the Act, it is necessary for your protection and ours, that you swear under oath that none of the assets intended to be transferred to such entities were derived from any of the activities specified in the Act which would constitute Money Laundering.
