Product Appearance and Availability. Myron has made every effort to display Products, colors and imprints as accurately as possible on this Site. However, the final Product delivered may vary from the image(s) viewed on this Site due to a number of factors that are not within Myron’s control. These factors include, but are not limited to, system capabilities and constraints of your computer, manufacturing process issues, and the availability of product and raw materials. While Myron will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to help ensure that the Products conform to your expectations, variations sometimes occur. All Product pricing, specifications and offerings are subject to change without notice.  This web site may describe products that are not available worldwide.  Please call (877) 803-3358 for non-U.S. availability, pricing, or delivery information.
