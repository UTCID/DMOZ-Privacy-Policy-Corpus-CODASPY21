"We're Not Just Another Internet Banner Company"
What our clients are saying...
“I want to thank for all the work you did to make the MetroLink station look so great. Everyone is thrilled with the final product (hope you are too). Jeff, special thanks for your willingness to respond to our concerns about the windscreens by producing them again, differently. They look outstanding now. I'm sure the crowds coming down to the Riverfront for July 4th celebrations got the full impact of the station. Your efforts are very much appreciated.” - Susan
"All I can say (or anyone at the city hall) is OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
-Lori
“You are the shining stars of the banner industry and the other vendors we have used in the past have become lackadaisical and unresponsive. I am requesting to the city that you become our only vendor for banners because of superior customer service.”
-Robb
"I just got off the phone with my client, and she is SOOO happy with how these turned out! She wanted to make sure that everyone who helped get these for them knows how much they appreciate the great work. I also wanted to let you know how nice it was working on this project with you guys - you made my life just that much less difficult, and that counts for a lot in my book :) Thank you!"
- Mary Ann
"You guys do a great job and someone from a neighboring town (Carbondale) came by and asked who does our banners, so I gave them your contact information!"
- Heather
“Appreciate the follow-up. I've been very pleased by the service and quality of your firm.”
- John, St. Louis Children’s Hospital
