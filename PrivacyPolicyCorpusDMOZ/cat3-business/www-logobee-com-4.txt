In order to provide a quick and accurate response to your web design project, LogoBee,Inc. asks only for the information necessary to work with your company.

Adaptive Mobile Conversion:
Description: Logobee takes responsibility in coding your original web site pages so that they are displayed in a compact (usually vertical) layout, which is also adjustable to the size of the mobile browser window.
It also involves the adaptation of a navigation bar in to a standard pull out menu.
Since there are hundreds of devices and operating systems (different versions) it is impossible to guarantee a 100% compatibility on all devices, or so that the content is displayed the same on all of the devices available on the market.
We guarantee to test functionality and display characteristics on a couple of major latest devices.
Content Writing:
Description: Logobee takes a task of creating written content for the web site based on a comprehensive questionnaire provided by logobee to the customer. You can purchase a package with a limited amount of words, which does not guarantee the full amount of words. It rather limits the amount that can be provided to the customer. The total amount of words is limited to the package purchased as well as the information provided by the customer.
