Keynotes, Conference Breakouts, Half Day, Full Day and Retreat formats.
PREVENT FREE FALL, Pack Your Own Parachute: Taming Tense Teams
Anxiety and poor ‘people skills’ cost your organization time, energy, creativity, productivity & money. Add to that lost clients and co-workers and you have a drain that is taking profits right out the door. Give your teams the insights, information & inspiration to handle difficult times, difficult issues, difficult situations and, difficult people now.
WRESTLING RHINOS: Conquering Conflict in the Wilds of Work
Based on Dr. Shaler’s book of the same title. CONFLICT happens. It needs to be dealt with effectively. Competently, comfortably and confidently turn confrontation into communication.
SAY WHAT YOU MEAN: Effective Communication Strategies That Save Time, Energy, Money & Frustration
If you want a project changed, a raise, or, even, your babysitter to arrive at a specific time – what is required is that you SAY WHAT YOU MEAN in a way that the LISTENER will perceive the information as you intended—AND YOU GREATLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING THE RESPONSE YOU WA NT. Learn the skills & strategies that make all the difference!
MANAGING CONFLICT PRODUCTIVELY – WITHOUT LOSING CLIENTS, Colleagues or credibility!
Strategies for turning confrontation into productive conversation. Strengthen relationships and foster creativity with pro-active conflict management.
MANAGING DIFFICULT PEOPLE EFFECTIVELY
You cannot always walk away from work and home situations you share with those you consider ‘difficult’. Learn skills and strategies for managing people, situations and behaviors that drive you up the wall like hostile customers, indecisive bosses & over-agreeable, do-nothing co-workers.
DON’T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!™ – Managing Anger – Yours and Theirs
Unexpressed, or poorly expressed, anger is one of the top reasons why people can be under-productive, burned out and difficult to get along with. If you are experiencing those symptoms, or you want to defuse underlying tension among team members, this practical seminar can put you on the right track, right away.
NEGOTIATING YOUR WAY TO BUSINESS SUCCESS: What You Need to Know to Get What You Want
