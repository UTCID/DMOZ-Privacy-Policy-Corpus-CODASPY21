Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many websites do) to place
“cookies” (small data files) on your computer's hard drive, which allow the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site and
to provide an efficient customer experience. The information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation, improve your experience with us, and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements. This
information is not shared with anyone other than Astronics affiliates and contractors who assist Astronics in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. Like many websites, we do not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers.

The information collected from you may include your name, address,
telephone, fax number, e-mail address, and the nature of your request, such as a product inquiry or newsletter subscription.Use of Collected InformationInitial domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site

we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to receive electronic annual reports or to be added to our supplier diversity database). Should you elect to subscribe to our newsletter,
we will send you periodic updates on new products, events, articles, and other happenings.We may share the personal information you provide with other companies, both inside and outside of the U.S., we have hired to provide services for us, such as a sales distributor or email service provider.

bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information
about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).If you share your personal information with us, we keep it for the length of time necessary. For some of our customers on long-term programs, this can mean we will keep your information for years. We periodically review this information and delete contacts
