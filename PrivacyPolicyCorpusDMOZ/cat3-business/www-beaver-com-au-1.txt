Terms
Terms and Conditions
Payment terms1. The terms of payment are strictly thirty (30) days (or such other period as nominated by the supplier herein) from the end of month of purchase and payment is due and payable on that date. Bunzl Brands & Operations Pty Ltd (ABN 54 001 428 815) and its related bodies corporate (as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001) (Supplier) may, at any time, unilaterally vary the terms of trade in its absolute and unfettered discretion.2. Should the Applicant not pay for the goods or services supplied by the Supplier in accordance with the credit terms as provided herein, or as agreed in writing by the Supplier from time to time, the Supplier will be entitled to charge an administration fee of 10 percent of the amount of the invoice payable per year, or part thereof, from the date the goods or services were supplied (and not the day when the Supplier’s invoice was payable) until payment by the Applicant.Jurisdiction3. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that this agreement shall be governed by the laws of New South Wales, and the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia which are in force in New South Wales.4. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that any contract for the supply of goods or services between the Supplier and the Applicant is formed at the address of the Supplier.5. The parties to this agreement submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales and the relevant federal courts and courts competent to hear appeals from those courts.Security/charges6. The Applicant charges in favour of the Supplier all of its estate and interest in any real property that the Applicant owns at present and in the future with the amount of its indebtedness hereunder until discharged.7. The Applicant charges in favour of the Supplier all of its estate and interest in any personal property that the Applicant owns at present and in the future with the amount of its indebtedness hereunder until discharged.8. The Applicant appoints as its duly constituted attorney the Supplier's company secretary from time to time to execute in the Applicant's name and as the Applicant's act and deed any real property mortgage, bill of sale or consent to any caveat the Supplier may choose to lodge against real property that the Applicant may own in any Land Titles Office in any state or territory of Australia, even though the Applicant may not have defaulted in carrying out its obligations hereunder.9. Where the Applicant has previously entered into an agreement with the Supplier by which the Applicant has granted a charge, mortgage or other security over real or personal property, those charges, mortgages or other security interests will continue and co-exist with the obligations and security interests created in this agreement. The Supplier may, at its election, vary the terms of such previous charges, mortgages or other securities to reflect the terms herein.Purpose of credit10. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the credit to be provided to the Applicant by the Supplier is to be applied wholly or predominantly for commercial purposes.Assignment11. The credit facilities provided by the Supplier are not transferable by the Applicant without the prior written consent of the Supplier. The Supplier may assign this agreement to another party without prior notice to the Applicant. The Supplier will give the Applicant notice when the assignment has been effected.Formation of contract12. Quotations made by the Supplier shall not be construed as an offer or obligation to supply in accordance with the quotation. The Supplier reserves the right to accept or reject, at its discretion, any offer to purchase received by it.13. Placement of an order, either verbally or in writing, shall imply acceptance of the Supplier’s offer and of these terms and conditions.Retention of title14. Whilst the Applicant has not paid for the goods supplied in full at any time, the Applicant agrees that property and title in the goods shall not pass to the Applicant and the Supplier retains the legal and equitable title in those goods supplied and not yet sold.15. Until payment in full has been made to the Supplier, the Applicant will hold the goods in a fiduciary capacity for the Supplier and agrees to store the goods in such a manner that they can be identified as the property of the Supplier, and shall not mix the goods with other similar goods.16. The Applicant shall be entitled to sell the goods in the ordinary course of its business, but until full payment for the goods has been made to the Supplier, the Applicant shall sell as agent and bailee for the Supplier and the proceeds of sale of the goods shall be held by the Applicant on trust for the Supplier absolutely.17. The Applicant’s indebtedness to the Supplier, whether in full or in part, shall not be discharged by the operation of clause 11 hereof unless and until the funds held on trust are remitted to the Supplier.18. The Applicant agrees that whilst property and title in the goods remains with the Supplier, the Supplier has the right, with or without prior notice to the Applicant, to enter upon any premises occupied by the Applicant (or any receiver, receiver and manager, administrator, liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy of the Applicant) to inspect the goods of the Supplier and to repossess the goods which may be in the Applicant’s possession, custody or control when payment is overdue.19. The Applicant will be responsible for the Supplier’s costs and expenses in exercising its rights under clause 13. Where the Supplier exercises any power to enter the premises, that entry will not give rise to any action of trespass or similar action on the part of the Applicant against the Supplier, its employees, servants or agents.20. The Applicant agrees that where the goods have been retaken into the possession of the Supplier, the Supplier has the absolute right to sell or deal with the goods, and if necessary, sell the goods with the trademark or name of the Applicant on those goods, and the Applicant hereby grants an irrevocable licence to the Supplier to do all things necessary to sell the goods bearing the name or trademark of the Applicant.21. The Applicant will be responsible for the Supplier’s costs and expenses in exercising its rights under clause 18. Where the Supplier exercises any power to enter the premises, that entry will not give rise to any action of trespass or similar action on the part of the Applicant against the Supplier, its employees, servants or agents.22. For the avoidance of doubt, the Supplier’s interest constitutes a ‘purchase money security interest’ pursuant to the Personal Property Securities Act 2009.Minimum Invoice Value23. Without limitation, the Supplier reserves the right at all times to reject orders with a pre-tax value less than $50.00. In the event that the Supplier, in its discretion, decides to accept orders with a pre-tax value less than $50.00, the Applicant shall pay the Supplier an administration and processing charge with respect to the relevant order equal to the difference between the pre-tax value of that order and $50.00.Test Certificates24. Certificates attesting to the compliance of goods ordered by the Applicant with relevant Australian standards (Test Certificates) will only be supplied if requested at the time of ordering by the Applicant. Test Certificates issued by the Supplier are valid only in respect of goods in the condition in which they leave the Supplier’s premises.Dimensions and Masses25. Dimensions and masses quoted with respect to goods supplied by the Supplier are approximate and subject to commercial tolerances and may be subject to change without notice.Claims by the Applicant26. All goods sold will be deemed to be of the required quantity and type unless a claim specifying particulars of deficiencies or incorrect type is made within 5 days of receipt of the good by the Applicant.27. Where the Supplier accepts responsibility for delivery of the goods, the Supplier will not be liable to the Applicant in relation to defective goods unless the Applicant gives notice of the defect to the Supplier in writing within 5 days after receipt of goods by the Applicant.28. Except as specifically provided to the contrary in these conditions, the Supplier shall in no case be liable in any way for goods damaged in transit.Cancellations and Returns for Credit29. Orders can only be cancelled or goods returned for credit with the prior written agreement of the Supplier provided that the goods are returned in the same re-saleable condition as when they were originally sold. Goods accepted for return must be despatched by a carrier nominated by the Supplier, only after receiving a credit return authority number from the Supplier (invoice number and date are required on all claims). Returns due to purchase error will incur a restocking charge of 20% and transportation costs of products will be for the account of the Applicant.30. Any goods specifically made and/or procured on behalf of the Applicant, that meet the Applicant’s specific request are not refundable for credit.31. The Supplier will not accept cancellations or returns unless notified within 7 days and only in the sole discretion of the Supplier.Delay on Delivery32. The Supplier will use its best endeavours to meet specified delivery dates and whether or not a delivery date is specified the Supplier will be under no liability of any kind for any delay in delivery from any cause whatsoever. If for any reason beyond the control of the Supplier, orders cannot be filled at the time stipulated by the Applicant, the Supplier shall be entitled to determine the relevant contract of sale and the Applicant shall not have any claims against the Supplier arising out of such cancellation, without prejudice to the rights of the Supplier to recover all sums owing to it in respect of goods or services provided prior to the date of such determination.Product Suitability33. Except to the extent that the Supplier has made express representations in writing (whether in catalogue or otherwise) as to safe working loads, the Applicant shall be responsible for determining the fitness of goods sold by the Supplier for the purpose for which they are intended and acknowledges that the Supplier is not aware of that purpose and that he has not relied on the Supplier’s advice.Liability34. Subject to statutory warranties that cannot be excluded, the Supplier shall not be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever and howsoever arising whether direct, indirect or consequential or in respect of any claim whenever and however made for any loss or damage, deterioration, deficiency or other fault or harm in the goods manufactured and/or delivered, work executed or services provided by or on behalf of the or in any arrangement with the Supplier or occasioned to the Applicant or any third or other party or to his or their property or interest and whether or not due to the negligence of the Supplier, its servants or agents.35.
