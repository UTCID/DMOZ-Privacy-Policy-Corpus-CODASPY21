to provide you with marketing information about other services or products we offer that (a) you have consented to receive; or (b) are similar to those that you have already bought (in which case it will only be the company you bought the same/similar services or products from who will contact you for this purpose);
to notify you about changes to our services and/or products;
build a profile of you, your preferences and your habits;
to provide customer support; and/or
to ensure that where you have an online account, content from the site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
Please note we will not use any financial or credit card information for any purpose other than to discharge our legal/regulatory duties and to process payments paid by you for our products and services or due to you by agreement.
Information we collect about you. We will use this information:

We may use the personal data we collect about you on an anonymised basis to create statistics and anonymised information which we then share with third parties including ad networks, search engines and analytics providers.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that promotions or competitions are offered to individuals who do not hold an account with us, and where personal information is provided, such personal information will be held in accordance with this privacy policy.
Using Your Information In Accordance with Data Protection Laws
Data protection laws require that we meet certain conditions before we are allowed to use your data in the manner described in this privacy policy.  We take our responsibilities under data protection laws extremely seriously, including meeting these conditions.  To use your personal data, we will rely on four conditions, depending on the activities we are carrying out:
Compliance with legal obligations: As a corporate group there are certain laws we need to comply with. In particular, we will need to process your personal information to verify your identity, and your source of funds for anti-money laundering, fraud and crime prevention purposes. Failure to provide the requisite personal information on sign-up/as you use our site, will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our products to you, as to allow you to purchase our products would mean we would be in breach of our legal obligations. You will not be able to object to processing or ask for the deletion of your personal information insofar as it falls under this category.
Necessary for the entry into/performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, a contract between you and the relevant group entity will have been entered into. In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (e.g. to allow you to place an order and receive the products), we will need to collect and process your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information on sign-up and financial information on entering into the transaction or objecting to this type of processing/exercising your deletion rights will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our products to you.
Consent:  We may provide you with certain marketing information about third party services or products where you have provided your explicit consent for us to do so.  Please note that we will use your personal information in order to provide certain marketing information for the same or similar products you have previously bought. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can object to processing of this nature.
Legitimate interests:  To use your personal data for any other purpose described in this privacy policy, we will rely on a condition known as "legitimate interests".  It is in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us with the information that we need to provide our products to you more effectively.  This requires us to carry out a balancing test of our interests in using your personal data (for example, in order to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us), against the interests you have as a citizen and the rights you have under data protection laws (for example, to not have your data sold to third party marketing companies without your knowledge, or not store your personal data in insecure or unstable countries or regions).  As a result of our balancing test, which is detailed below, we have determined, acting reasonably and considering the circumstances, that we are able to process your personal data in accordance with the data protection laws on the basis that we have a legitimate business interest.
Legitimate interest
We have a legitimate interest in processing your information as:
both you and we benefit from the effective management of your account(s) (where applicable);
both you and we benefit from the effective management, updates and administration of our site; and
we would be unable to provide our services without processing your information.
Necessity
We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as we process your personal data only so far as is necessary to provide our goods and/or services.
Impact of processing
We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as it can be reasonably expected for us to process your personal information in this way to provide our goods and/or services, we will implement safeguards for vulnerable individuals, and you are able to withdrawn your consent to the processing of special categories of personal data.
How Long We Keep Your Information for
When your data is no longer required for the purposes listed above, we will delete it within 6 years from the closure or your account/ delivery of your order or of our last positive interaction with you. This data is archived where customers or account holders are inactive for a period of 24 months. We keep your personal information for 6 years, to enable us to retain the information we may require for legal and regulatory purposes.
In some circumstances, some of your data will be deleted in much shorter timescales, where possible, for example:
Call and CCTV recordings will typically be deleted after 6 months;
Marketing consents will be refreshed or deleted after 24 months;
Marketing emails and other communications where possible will typically be deleted after 24 months; and
Business contact details will typically be deleted once our relationship (i.e. our contract) has come to an end.
Disclosure of your information
We may share your personal information with any member of the Arran Isle group, which means the ultimate holding company, Arran Isle Limited, and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006 ("Arran Isle Group").
We will only disclose your information to:
business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you including service providers who operate elements of our site service and process personal data on our behalf. These may include businesses who provide technology services such as hosting for our servers and email distribution, and business partners who provide delivery fulfilment services. We may also disclose your personal data to our supply and delivery partners for the purpose of processing and fulfilling your order;
members of the Arran Isle Group business partners and third party suppliers and service providers for the purposes listed under How We Use Your Information above;
third party suppliers and service providers to the extent they assist the Arran Isle Group with its legal/ regulatory obligations e.g. providers of services in respect of anti-money laundering, fraud, verification etc;
selected third parties so that they can contact you with details of the services that they provide, where you have expressly opted-in/consented to the disclosure of your personal data for these purposes;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site and other selected third parties; and
law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our legal advisers, courts and any other authorised bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity or other regulatory or legal matters etc.
In order to place an order you may need a facility to send and receive money. Third party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions may be used to process such financial transactions ("ESP's"). By accepting this privacy policy you agree to the sharing of necessary personal information, with the ESP's, to enable the processing of transactions. Where necessary this may include the transfer of information outside of the EEA.
We will disclose your personal information to third parties:
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
in the event of any insolvency situation (e.g. the administration or liquidation) of Arran Isle Limited or any of its group entities;
if we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets;
to the extent required where charges and security are held over our assets.
in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or website terms of use;
to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our staff, our customers, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of staff and customer safety, crime prevention, fraud protection and credit risk reduction; and
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or regulatory requirements, or otherwise for the prevention or detection of fraud or crime.
Credit Reference Agencies And Credit Circles
In order to process your customer account application we may supply your personal information to credit reference agencies (CRAs) and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. CRAs will share your information with other organisations. The identities of the CRAs, and the ways in which they use and share personal information, are explained in more detail at http://www.experian.co.uk/crain/index.html
Where our businesses are members of Credit Circles, information including trade credit performance will be made available to other participating organisations.
Where We Store Your Personal Data
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.  This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Security Of Your Personal Data
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site/your account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
