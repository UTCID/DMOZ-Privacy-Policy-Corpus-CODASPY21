We need this information to investigate the complaint or incident and (if necessary) report it to health or other authorities, law enforcement agencies, our insurers and any suppliers who may be involved).

Test and Trace information
To support NHS Test and Trace, we are required by law to collect and keep a record of staff and guests and visitors who come onto our premises for the purpose of contact tracing.
By maintaining records of staff and guests, and sharing these with NHS Test and Trace where requested, we can help to identify people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus.
As a guest of Frankie & Benny’s, you will be asked to provide some basic information and contact details as part of your booking (either when you pre-book or, if you don’t already have a booking, when you walk in and ask for a table). If a booking cannot be made on our system, we may ask you to complete a paper Test and Trace form. The following information will be collected:
•	the names of all guests, or if it is a group of people, the name of the lead member of the group
•	a contact phone number for each guest, or for the lead member of a group of people
•	date of visit and arrival time and departure time.
We will also use this information to support NHS Test and Trace. Frankie & Benny’s will be responsible for compliance with data protection legislation for the period of time it holds the information. When that information is requested by the NHS Test and Trace service, the NHS would at this point be responsible for compliance with data protection legislation.
We will only share information with NHS Test and Trace if it is specifically requested by them. For example, if another guest at the venue reported symptoms and subsequently tested positive, NHS Test and Trace can request the log of guest details for a particular time period (for example, this may be all guests who visited on a particular day or time period or guests who dined in the vicinity of the guest who tested positive). NHS Test and Trace will not disclose this information to any third party unless required to do so by law (for example, as a result of receiving a court order).
If the information is collected only for the purpose of contact tracing (for example, if you are asked to complete a paper Test and Trace form) it will not be used for other purposes, and In addition, where the information is only collected for the purpose of contact tracing, it will be destroyed 21 days after the date of your visit.
However, if the information is part of, or collected at the same time as, information that we would usually collect, store and use in our ordinary dealings with you (such as the information we collect for bookings or when you use our WiFi or the Pay by Phone facility), this information will continue to be held after 21 days and we will use it as we usually would, unless and until you tell us not to.
Your information will always be stored and used in compliance with the relevant data protection legislation.
How do we protect your information?
We apply appropriate technical and organisational security measures to prevent unauthorized access to Personal Information we hold about you. All Personal Information about our guests is stored within a robust secure environment. We never sell your data to a third party. Our practice is that no data is ever provided to third parties except in the circumstances described below under Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.
Please note that email correspondence with us is in free format text and cannot be encrypted. Accordingly please do not send any sensitive information such as credit card details or passwords via email. Please also note that perfect security does not exist on the Internet. You’ll know that you’re in a secure area of our website when a “padlock” icon appears on your screen and the “http” portion of our URL address changes to “https.” The “s” stands for “secure.”

•	where required by external parties we deal with such as our insurers (e.g. where there has been an accident or incident in one of our restaurants), suppliers (if there has been a food-related incident) or where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of any legal claims.
Special offers and promotions
We think you will love hearing about our special offers, discounts, news and information so you don’t miss out on our special deals so unless you have told us that you do not wish to be contacted for this purpose, we will send these to you by email or text.

Legal reasons: we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or regulation (e.g. food safety), (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
Fraud / Credit Risk: where necessary to prevent fraud or reduce credit risk, we may exchange your Personal Information with other companies and organisations.
Business transfers: in any corporate transactions (e.g. buying or selling of businesses, stores or business units) Personal Information is generally one of the transferred assets. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, however that would always be under conditions of strict confidentiality and limited to the specific purpose.

We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

Sharing and disclosure of Personal Information
We want you to be clear on what we do with your Personal Information. We will keep your Personal Information secure and never sell your Personal Information to anyone. We do use sub-contractors to carry out certain functions on our behalf and, occasionally, have to disclose your Personal Information (for example, to provide specific services to you or dealing with insurers or public authorities like the police). This is described more fully below:
Sub-contractors, suppliers and agents: from time to time we employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf including taking orders and fulfilling order deliveries, designing and sending guest communications, providing guest vouchers, analysing data, providing elements of our IT or back-up systems, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, improving our services and providing customer service. They may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to use it for other purposes and cannot modify, disclose or erase your data without our instructions.
Payment processing: Payment processing services are provided by Braintree, a division of PayPal (Europe) S.a.r.l. et Cie, SCA. We will also share your email address with Omnifi Limited who will generate and send you electronic receipts and other payment confirmations on our behalf.
Legal reasons: we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or regulation (e.g. food safety), (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
Fraud / Credit Risk: where necessary to prevent fraud or reduce credit risk, we may exchange your Personal Information with other companies and organisations.
Business transfers: in any corporate transactions (e.g. buying or selling of businesses, stores or business units) Personal Information is generally one of the transferred assets. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, however that would always be under conditions of strict confidentiality and limited to the specific purpose.
Sending data outside of Europe: We do not transfer your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union. However, some of our appointed carriers, sub-contractors, suppliers and agents may transfer, use or store data in other countries. Where this is the case, they are obliged to ensure that there is equivalent protection for your Personal Information as would be the case within the European Union.
We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These safeguards may include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information by a data controller established in the European Union to a processor established in a third country which does not offer adequate level of protection.
