Cookie Policy
How we collect, use, store and protect your personal data
Cookie Policy
We have developed this cookie policy (the Cookie Policy) in order to explain how we use cookies and similar technologies (together, Cookies) on this website (the Website) and to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of your personal information.
The first time that you visit our Website, we notify you about our use of Cookies through a notification banner. By continuing to use the Website, you consent to our use of Cookies as described in this Cookie Policy. However, you can choose whether or not to continue accepting Cookies at any later time. Information on how to manage Cookies is set out later in this Cookie Policy.
Please note that our use of any personal information we collect about you is subject to our Privacy Policy.
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files containing user IDs that are automatically placed on your computer or other device when you visit a website. The Cookies are stored by the internet browser. The browser sends the Cookies back to the website on each subsequent visit, allowing the website to recognise your computer or device. This recognition enables the website provider to observe your activity on the website, deliver a personalised, responsive service and improve the website.
Cookies can be Session Cookies or Persistent Cookies. Session Cookies allow a website to link a series of your actions during one browser session, for example to remember the items you have added to a shopping basket. Session Cookies expire after a browser session and are therefore not stored on your computer or device afterwards. Persistent Cookies are stored on your computer or device between browser sessions and can be used when you make subsequent visits to the website, for example to remember your website preferences, such as language or font size.
Cookies We Use and Their Purpose
We use four types of Cookies - Strictly Necessary Cookies, Performance Cookies, Functionality Cookies and Targeting or Advertising Cookies. Each type of Cookies and the purposes for which we use them are described in this section.
1. Strictly Necessary Cookies
Strictly Necessary Cookies enable you to move around the Website and use essential features. For example, if you log into the Website, we use a Cookie to keep you logged in and allow you to access restricted areas, without you having to repeatedly enter your login details. If you are registering for or purchasing a product or service, we will use Cookies to remember your information and selections, as you move through the registration or purchase process
Strictly Necessary Cookies are necessary for our Website to provide you with a full service. If you disable them, certain essential features of the Website will not be available to you and the performance of the Website will be impeded.
2. Performance Cookies
Performance Cookies collect information about how you use our Website, for example which pages you visit and if you experience any errors. These Cookies dont collect any information that could identify you – all the information collected is anonymous. We may use these Cookies to help us understand how you use the website and assess how well the Website performs and how we could improve it for you. We may also use such Cookies to discover which parts of the Website interest you and measure how effective our advertising is.
3. Functionality Cookies
Functionality Cookies enable a website to provide you with specific services or a customised experience. We may use these Cookies to provide you with services such as watching a video or adding user comments. We may also use such Cookies to remember changes you make to your settings or preferences (for example, changes to text size or your choice of language or region) or offer you time-saving or personalised features.
4. Targeting or Advertising Cookies
Targeting or Advertising Cookies enable a website to show you relevant advertising or facilitate your use of third party services. We may use these Cookies to provide information about your Website visit to advertisers, so that they can show you adverts more relevant to your interests, limit the number of times you see the same advert and measure the effectiveness of their advertising. We may also use such Cookies to make it easier for you to like or share Website content through your social network(s). The social networking websites may subsequently use information about your visit to target advertising to you on those websites. Please see their website terms and policies for further information on such use.
