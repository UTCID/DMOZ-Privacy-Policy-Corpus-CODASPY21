A request for interim equitable relief will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.Miscellaneous ProvisionsThe failure of Company to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit Company’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.  Section headings used herein are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  The word including means including without limitation.  If any terms or provision of these Terms are for any reason held to be void, invalid or unenforceable, the other terms and provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and those of the invalid or unenforceable provision will be construed so that it is enforceable and maintains its original intent to the fullest extent permitted by law.
