TERMS OF USE
We ask that you abide by the terms and conditions that follow — your use of the Munro Shoes website (the "Site"), operated by Munro & Company, Inc., constitutes your agreement with these terms. We reserve the right to revise these terms and conditions periodically. When we make changes, we will post them here. We encourage you to occasionally check this section, to review for changes. Your use of the Site following any changes indicates your agreement to be bound by those modifications. If you do not agree to these conditions (without modification) you are not authorized to access or otherwise use the site.
You may download or copy the Contents and other downloadable materials displayed on the Site for your personal use only. No right, title or interest in any downloaded materials or software is transferred to you as a result of any such downloading or copying. You may not reproduce (except as noted above), publish, transmit, distribute, display, modify, create derivative works from, sell or participate in any sale of, or exploit in any way, in whole or in part, any of the Contents, the Site, or any related software.
PRODUCT INFORMATION
Most Munro products displayed on the Site are available in select stores in the United States and select foreign markets, while supplies last. In some cases, merchandise displayed on the Site may not be available for sale in stores or on the Site.
COLORS
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear on the Site. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
COMMENTS AND SUBMISSIONS
All comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, and other submissions disclosed, submitted or offered to Munro on or by this Site or otherwise disclosed, submitted or offered in connection with your use of this Site (collectively, "Comments") shall be and remain Munro's property. Such disclosure, submission or offer of any Comments shall constitute an assignment to Munro of all worldwide rights, titles and interests in all copyrights and other intellectual properties in the Comments. Munro is and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any Comments in confidence; (2) to pay to user any compensation for any Comments; or (3) to respond to any user Comments.
You agree that no Comments submitted by you to the Site will violate any right of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other personal or proprietary right(s). You further agree that no Comments submitted by you to the Site will be or contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive or obscene material. You are and shall remain solely responsible for the content of any Comments you make.
You agree that Munro may use and/or disclose information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Munro & Company, Inc., harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising from or related to your use of the Site.
LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES
To the extent that this Site contains links to outside services and resources, the availability and content of which Munro does not control, any concerns regarding any such service or resource, or any link thereto, should be directed to the particular outside service or resource.
TERMINATION
In addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, we may, without prior notice to you, immediately terminate this Agreement or revoke any or all of your rights granted under this Agreement. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you shall immediately cease all access to and use of the Site and we shall, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, immediately revoke all password(s) and account identification issued to you and deny your access to and use of the Site in whole or in part.

DISCLAIMER
IN NO EVENT SHALL MUNRO & COMPANY, INC., OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF MUNRO HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION, UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THE SITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
INACCURACY DISCLAIMER
From time to time there may be information on this Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice. We further reserve the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Munro shall not be liable for any special or consequential damages that result from this use of, or the inability to use, the materials on this site or the performance of the products, even if Munro has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
MISCELLANEOUS
Unless otherwise specified and except to the extent Munro products are offered for sale in the United States through this Site, this Site and the Contents thereof are displayed solely for the purpose of promoting Munro's products and services available in the United States and select foreign markets. This Site is controlled and operated by Munro & Company, Inc. from its offices in Arkansas.
This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions.
