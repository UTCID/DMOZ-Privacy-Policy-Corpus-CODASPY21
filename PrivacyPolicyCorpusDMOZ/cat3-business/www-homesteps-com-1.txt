HomeSteps Website Terms and Conditions
General
You have accessed the Terms and Conditions applicable to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation websites.
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS
CAREFULLY AS THEY GOVERN YOUR USE OF FREDDIE MAC WEBSITES. BY USING A FREDDIE
MAC WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AS THEY MAY
BE MODIFIED BY FREDDIE MAC FROM TIME-TO-TIME AND POSTED ON THIS FREDDIE MAC
WEBSITE.
Each user of a Freddie Mac website agrees as follows:
No Offer or Solicitation of Securities
Freddie Mac operates several websites, any one of which may
include information, content and documentation (collectively
"Information") related to, or referenced in the offering
documentation for, certain Freddie Mac securities, including offering circulars
and related supplements and agreements. Freddie Mac securities may not be
eligible for offer or sale in certain jurisdictions or to certain persons. The
Information is provided for your general information only, is current only as
of its specified date and does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to buy securities. All Information relating to Freddie
Mac securities is qualified in its entirety by the relevant offering circular
and any related supplements. Investors should review the relevant offering
circular and any related supplements before making a decision with respect to
the purchase or sale of any security. In addition, before purchasing any
security, please consult your legal and financial advisors for information
about and analysis of the security, its risks and its suitability as an
investment in your particular circumstances.
Unauthorized Access, Copying or Downloading
Freddie Mac specifically prohibits access to any Freddie Mac website for any unlawful purpose. Information on Freddie Mac websites may be
downloaded for personal use, but no portion of a Freddie Mac website may be
published, sold, republished, printed, copied, retransmitted, reposted, or
displayed on a website or in other communication materials without Freddie
Mac's prior written consent. See the content usage permission
and linking policy
for more
details.
User Registration and Account Creation, User Name ID and Password
Security
If any portion of a Freddie Mac website provides for registration
or creation of a user account and you wish to register or create a user
account, you agree that you will provide Freddie Mac with accurate, truthful,
and current registration information. You agree that you will not: (i) select a
username that, to your knowledge, is already used by another person; (ii) use a
username in which another person has rights without such person's
authorization; or (iii) use a username or password that Freddie Mac deems
inappropriate. Freddie Mac has no obligation to verify the authenticity of any
registration information, but reserves the right to refuse to create your
account for any reason. You are solely responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your registration information and passwords. Freddie Mac
will have the right to rely upon any information received from any person using
a password assigned to you and will incur no liability arising out of such
reliance. Freddie Mac reserves the right to terminate access to all or any
portion of a Freddie Mac website at any time without notice. Where applicable,
Freddie Mac will handle user information that you submit to a Freddie Mac website in accordance with the website's Privacy Policy.
Third Party Links; Products and Services
Periodically, links may be established between a Freddie Mac website and websites operated or content provided by third parties (each a "Third Party Website"). For purposes of these Terms and Conditions,
the term "link" includes both outlinks (hypertext links to external
websites or content) and inlinks (hypertext links that draw material from
other sources into a Freddie Mac website).
Except to the extent expressly stated otherwise on a Freddie Mac website, Freddie Mac has no control over any such Third Party Website. In
addition, from time to time, products and services provided by third parties
(the "Third Party Services") may be offered for sale or made
available through links from a Freddie Mac website.  Any such offer of the Third Party Services
does not constitute an endorsement by Freddie Mac of the Third Party Services
or the providers thereof.  In no event
will Freddie Mac have any liability related to any Third Party Website or any Third
Party Services.
Non-Confidentiality of Communications
If you send a message or information to a Freddie Mac website,
such as (but not limited to) an e-mail to the Webmaster, you hereby grant to
Freddie Mac the right to use and disclose the communication and any related
information as Freddie Mac deems appropriate, except to the extent the Freddie
Mac website or the website privacy policy specifies otherwise. YOU ARE
HEREBY ADVISED THAT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE ON A
FREDDIE MAC WEBSITE, NO FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED AND NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR
SENDING OR RECEIVING CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS. TO THE EXTENT SUCH FACILITIES
ARE PROVIDED OR PROVISIONS ARE MADE, IT IS SOLELY ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
No Warranties; Limitation of Liability
Although Freddie Mac attempts to provide useful Information,
Freddie Mac does not guarantee that the Information posted on or linked to any
Freddie Mac website is accurate, current or suitable for any particular
purpose. Freddie Mac assumes no obligation to update or continue to post or
link to the Information. Freddie Mac does not guarantee that access to any
Freddie Mac website will be uninterrupted, or that a Freddie Mac website
cannot be tampered with by third parties. While Freddie Mac has implemented
security measures designed to protect most information sent to the Freddie Mac
websites, Freddie Mac does not guarantee that information sent to a Freddie
Mac website will not be obtained, reviewed, disclosed or tampered with by
third parties. THE FREDDIE MAC WEBSITES, THE INFORMATION POSTED OR LINKED
THERETO AND ANY SOFTWARE RELATED THERETO ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR ACCURACY OR ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. USE
OF THE FREDDIE MAC WEBSITES, SUCH INFORMATION AND SUCH SOFTWARE IS AT THE
USER'S SOLE RISK. IN NO EVENT WILL FREDDIE MAC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY FREDDIE MAC WEBSITE (INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO ANY SOFTWARE RELATED THERETO), ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITE, ANY
THIRD PARTY SERVICES OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR LINKED TO ANY FREDDIE
MAC WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER WEBSITE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER
A CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF FREDDIE MAC IS AWARE
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
Choice of Law; Access Restrictions
These Terms and Conditions will be construed in accordance with
the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America,
excluding provisions of Virginia law concerning choice-of-law that would result
in the laws of any state or country other than Virginia being applied. However,
the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (or any substantially similar
law enacted by Virginia) will not apply to these Terms and Conditions, and
instead the law of Virginia as it exists without reference to the Uniform
Computer Information Transactions Act will apply. Any claims, actions or
proceedings related to a Freddie Mac website or these Terms and Conditions
must be brought in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, Alexandria Division. By using a Freddie Mac website, you agree to
submit to the jurisdiction of said court for such purposes. FREDDIE MAC
OPERATES THE FREDDIE MAC WEBSITES FROM ITS OFFICES IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF
VIRGINIA OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. FREDDIE MAC MAKES NO REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR LINKED TO ANY FREDDIE MAC
WEBSITE IS APPROPRIATE OR LEGALLY AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION, DISPLAY OR USE IN
LOCATIONS OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND ACCESS TO SUCH
INFORMATION FROM JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT LEGAL IS STRICTLY
PROHIBITED. IF YOU ACCESS OR USE ANY INFORMATION FROM OR THROUGH A FREDDIE MAC
WEBSITE, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT SUCH ACCESS AND USE IS
PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED.
Export Laws
Software, Information and encryption codes from Freddie Mac websites may be subject to United States export control laws and regulations
("Export Laws"). No software, Information or encryption codes may be
downloaded from any Freddie Mac website or otherwise exported or reexported
(i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
Iran, Syria, or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; (ii)
by or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated
Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders; or (iii) in a
manner that otherwise violates the Export Laws. By downloading or using any
such software, Information or encryption codes, you represent and warrant that
you will comply with all applicable Export Laws related thereto.
Supplemental Terms and Conditions
Supplemental or different terms and conditions than those set
forth in these Terms and Conditions may be applicable to information you
receive or transactions you engage in using a Freddie Mac website. Any such
supplemental or different terms and conditions (i) will be disclosed to you,
either by being posted on the applicable Freddie Mac website or by being
included in a separate agreement, (ii) will be in addition to these Terms and
Conditions, (iii) will, if expressly so indicated, supersede specific portions
of these Terms and Conditions, and (iv) will be binding on you by virtue of
your use of the applicable Freddie Mac website.
Severability
The provisions of these Terms and Conditions are severable. If any
such provision is determined to be unenforceable, such unenforceability will
not affect any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, and the Terms and
Conditions will be construed as if such unenforceable provision had not been
contained herein. No waiver by Freddie Mac of any right under or provision of
these Terms and Conditions will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other
such right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other
time.
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Freddie Mac and each of
its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
injuries, damages, losses, liabilities, claims, judgments and settlements,
including all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys fees, arising out of any
action or claim related to any negligent or willful act or omission by you
while accessing a Freddie Mac website or your failure to comply with any of
these terms and conditions.
