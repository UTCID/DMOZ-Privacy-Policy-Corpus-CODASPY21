The Charles Machine Works, Inc. Privacy Notice
CMW's Commitment to Your Privacy
The Charles Machine Works, Inc. respects your privacy. We provide this Privacy Notice so you understand how we treat the information we receive from you and about you when you use our websites, content, or mobile applications (collectively the “Sites”), as well as purchase our products, interact with us, visit our premises or otherwise use our services (together with the Sites, the "Services"). This Notice applies, in general, to all Services operated by or on behalf of The Charles Machine Works, Inc. of 1959 West Fir Avenue Perry, Oklahoma  73077 USA, and our subsidiaries and business units worldwide (collectively, "CMW").
Please read this Privacy Notice. By using or visiting the Services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Notice and agree to our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”). Use of our Services is voluntary. If you do not agree to the Privacy Notice and the Terms, you must immediately cease such use.
The Personal Data We Collect
There are a few places where CMW gives you an opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information that directly or indirectly identifies you (your “Personal Data”). When you engage in certain activities, such as ordering a product or service; filling out a form to request a demo or enter a contest or sweepstakes; participating in third-party social network service activities whether through the Services or third-party social network services; filling out a survey; applying for a job; sending feedback or product reviews; requesting owners and parts manuals; visiting our facilities or registering your product online, CMW may ask you to provide Personal Data such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and other information. You choose whether to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information CMW asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
In addition to the information you choose to provide, CMW may automatically collect other information about you through the Sites. Such information may include, without limitation: the unique device identifier of your mobile device, mobile network information, the model and serial number and telephone number of your mobile device, information regarding your access to and use of an App, the Site pages you visit and the time of your visits, your operating system, browser type, the domain name of your internet service provider, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Notice. For example, CMW may use your IP address, together with other Personal Data that you may provide, such as your email address, to communicate with you directly about products and services that CMW believes may be of interest based on your activity on the Sites.
CMW also may collect information about you from publicly available sources, or from third parties such as our channel partners or credit reference agencies in connection with your purchases. CMW may receive information about your interaction with us and use of our Services through a third-party social networking service.
Except as otherwise stated in this Notice, your IP address, cookies and other technologies (as more particularly described below) are generally used by CMW on an anonymous basis (i.e. without directly referring to you by name), among other things to (1) help diagnose problems with CMW's server, administer the Services, measure the use of the Services, improve the content of the Services; (2) to identify visitors' domain names, the type of web browsers used, the pages viewed, the websites from which a visitor found the Services, the websites to which a visitor went after leaving the Services; the search terms and search engines used to find the Services; and (3) to gather other web analytics information relating to visitors' use and navigation of the Services.  We will comply with applicable laws regarding our use and processing of your data.

CMW uses various types of cookies:
Strictly Necessary cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Sites. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided. They are deleted when you close the browser.

Functionality Cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features and to improve your experience when using our Sites.
Targeting Cookies or advertising cookies are used to collect information about your browsing habits in order to enable CMW and its affiliates to provide you with information about products and services that may be of specific interest to you.

Persistent Device Identifiers are unique strings that are associated with the mobile device that you use to connect to an App. Persistent device identifiers may be modified or disabled by sophisticated users.
We use service providers to help us analyze patterns of user behavior on our Sites. These providers will collect your IP address and other information by automated means in order to report on your user activity. They may retain and use anonymized, aggregated data collected from users of our Sites in connection with their own businesses, including in order to improve their products and services. Authentication and tracking logs are used to compile user statistics.
We use advertising brokers to advertise online.  CMW and third party vendors such as Google use cookies to serve our ads to you on sites across the Internet based on your past visits to the Sites.
Third parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Internet services when you visit our Sites.
Where our Sites interact with social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, these platforms may deploy persistent cookies which will be kept on your device until their expiration or earlier manual deletion. If you use these functionalities, the plug-in and its content are loaded directly from the social media provider’s servers and included in the website by your browser. We cannot influence which Personal Data the social media provider will collect about you. For more information, please see the privacy notices of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others.
You may manage or block cookies at any time by adjusting the browser settings on your device.  For comprehensive information on the subject of blocking cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.  For information and to opt out of interest based advertising, you may also access the tools provided on any of the following sites: https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org, www.youronlinechoices.com, and www.networkadvertising.org/choices.  Note that clearing cookies from your browser will remove the above opt-outs because they are stored in cookies.
At this time we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals sent from Web browsers or other mechanisms that provide users the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about a user’s online activities over time and across third-party internet services.
European Residents: Right to Opt-out
To comply with legislation in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the UK, CMW asks for your consent to set the cookies described above. When you arrive on the Site, a banner informing you of the types of cookies we use will appear. By clicking 'continue' you expressly consent to the use of such cookies. Once your consent has been provided, this message will not appear again when you revisit. If you do not click “continue,” your continued use of the Site will indicate your implied consent. The banner will remain, and we will set only the cookies for which implied consent is sufficient. If you, or another user of your computer, wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you can do so by altering your browser settings or by selecting the opt-out options above.  In some instances, when you opt-out, a new cookie (Opt-Out-Cookie) is placed in your web browser. This tells the third party provider to cease data collection from your browser and prevents advertisements from being delivered to you.
If you would like us to stop sending you marketing emails, we encourage you to use the opt-out link at the bottom of any marketing email we send.  You may also contact us at info@ditchwitch.com.
