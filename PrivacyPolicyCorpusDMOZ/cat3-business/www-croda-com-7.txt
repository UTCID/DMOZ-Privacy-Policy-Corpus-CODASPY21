Board Diversity Policy
The Board is committed to greater diversity within our business. The diversity of our people - whether in terms of ideas, skills, knowledge, experience, ethnicity, gender or any other measure - is very important for the continuing long term success of the Company. This also applies when it comes to the makeup of the Board to ensure that it is well equipped to lead the business effectively, embraces new ideas and makes good use of differences in experiences, backgrounds and perspectives to satisfy all the different stakeholders we have as a global organisation.
The Board has adopted the following Board Diversity Policy:
This Board Diversity Policy (the “Policy”) sets out the approach to diversity of the Board of Croda International Plc (the “Board”).  The Policy applies to the Board of Croda International Plc (the “Company”). The Policy does not apply to diversity in relation to employees of the wider Croda Group, which is covered by the Group Policy on Managing Diversity.
Policy Statement
The Board is committed to greater diversity within our business. The diversity of our people – whether in terms of ideas, skills, knowledge, experience, ethnicity, gender, or any other measure - is very important for the continuing long term success of the Company. This also applies when it comes to the makeup of the Board to ensure that it is well equipped to lead the business effectively, embraces new ideas and makes good use of differences in experiences, backgrounds and perspectives to satisfy all the different stakeholders we have as a global organisation.
Regarding all appointments to the Board, whether for Non-Executive or Executive positions, we will carefully consider the benefits of greater diversity, including gender diversity, whilst ensuring that we fulfil our obligations to our shareholders to recruit the best person, on merit, to the relevant role.
In accordance with its terms of reference, our Nomination Committee (the “Committee”) regularly reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board and recommends candidates to fill Board vacancies as they arise. In considering the composition of the Board the Committee will consider, amongst other things, the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of the Board.
The Board and the Committee consider the size of our Board is appropriate, engendering thorough debate, discussion and challenge at Board meetings and allowing all directors to be fully involved and contribute to Board decisions. Although there are no current plans to increase the size of the Board, we will work towards increasing diversity, including gender, as vacancies arise and suitable candidates are identified.
Measurable objectives
At any given time the Board may seek to improve one or more aspects of its diversity and measure progress accordingly. In identifying suitable candidates for appointment to the Board, the Committee will:
For all Non-Executive Director appointments, and where appropriate Executive Director appointments, use open advertising or the services of external executive search firms to facilitate the search;
If using executive search firms, only use firms that have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms;
Ensure gender balanced shortlists for all Non-Executive Director and Executive Director appointments;
Consider candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, including ethnically diverse candidates and candidates without public company board experience;
Consider candidates on merit and against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board; and
Ensure that no unlawful discrimination occurs at any stage in the selection process on the grounds of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, maternity, pregnancy, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation.
The Board is committed to at least maintaining the current 33% level of female representation and will move towards a gender balanced Board, whilst ensuring that diversity in its broadest sense remains a central feature of the Board.
Monitoring and reporting
The Committee will report annually, in the corporate governance section of the Company’s Annual Report, on the process it has used in relation to Board appointments. Such report will include a summary of, and progress against, the objectives in the Policy.
Review of the Policy
The Committee will review the Policy annually, which will include an assessment of the effectiveness of the Policy.  The Committee will discuss any revisions that may be required and recommend any such revisions to the Board for approval.
Approved by the Board on 22 February 2019

Non-Audit Policy
This policy applies to all companies, businesses and functional areas within the Group; and to all situations where we propose to engage with the external auditor for the provision of non-audit services.  This policy is in place to mitigate any risks threatening, or appearing to threaten, the external audit firm’s independence and objectivity arising through the provision of non-audit services.
The policy is revised as a result of the Revised Ethical Standard issued by the Financial Reporting Council in December 2019.  The new ethical standard means that virtually no non-audit services are allowed unless they are audit related services, largely carried out by the audit team. This is to ensure that the independence of the auditors is never threatened. The permitted services fall into two categories, one where the fee involved has no impact, and another where the fees involved are capped as a percentage of the audit fee. The standard also lists those services which an auditor is forbidden from carrying out. The consequences of an auditor inadvertently carrying out such work can be severe, and therefore, strict monitoring and control will be applied as outlined in the policy.
Whilst the new standard is applicable for the periods commencing on or after 15 March 2020, the Group will be early adopting. Accordingly, this policy becomes effective immediately.
1. Permitted non-audit services:
The Group’s auditors will be appointed only to provide the permitted non-audit / additional services as defined in section 5B of the standard. These are essentially audit related services, largely carried out by members of the audit engagement team, and where the work involved is closely related to the work performed in the audit and where it is clear there are no auditor independence concerns. The services which are exempt from the non-audit services fee cap (defined in 3(a) below) as well as the services which are subject to this cap are outlined as below:
(a) Services required by law or regulation and exempt from the non-audit services cap
Reporting required by a competent authority or regulator under law or regulation for example;
Reporting to a regulator on client assets;
in relation to entities regulated under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), reports under s166 and s340 of FSMA;
Reporting to a regulator on regulatory financial statements;
Reporting on a Solvency and Financial Condition Report under Solvency II.
In the case of a controlled undertaking incorporated and based in a third country, reporting required by law or regulation in that jurisdiction where the auditor is permitted to undertake that engagement;
Reporting on internal financial controls when required by law or regulation;
Reporting on the iXBRL tagging of financial statements in accordance with the European Single Electronic Format for annual financial reports;
Reports, required by or supplied to competent authorities / regulators supervising the audited entity, where the authority / regulator has either specified the auditor to provide the service or identified to the entity that the auditor would be an appropriate choice for service provider;
Services which support the entity in fulfilling an obligation required by UK law or regulation, including listing requirements where: the provision of such services is time critical; the subject matter of the engagement is price sensitive; and it is probable that an objective, reasonable and  informed third party would conclude that the understanding of the entity obtained by the auditor for the audit of the financial statements is relevant to the service, and where the nature of the service would not compromise independence;
(b) Services subject to the non-audit services cap
Reviews of interim financial information; and providing verification of interim profits not otherwise required by law or regulation;
Where not otherwise required by law or regulation, non-audit and additional services, as defined in the standard provided as auditor of the entity, or as reporting accountant, in relation to information of the audited entity for which it is probable that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the understanding of the entity obtained by the auditor is relevant to the service, and where the nature of the service would not compromise independence;
Extended audit or assurance work that is authorised by those charged with governance performed on financial or performance information and/or financial or operational controls, in an entity relevant to an engagement or a third-party service provider, where this work is closely linked with the audit work;
Additional assurance work or agreed upon procedures, authorised by those charged with governance performed on material included within or referenced from the annual report of an entity relevant to an engagement;
Reporting on government grants;
Reporting on covenant or loan agreements, which require independent verification, and other reporting to third parties with whom the entity relevant to an engagement has a business relationship in accordance with Appendix C of standard;
Services which have been the subject of an application to the Competent Authority in accordance with Regulation 79 of The Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/177);
Generic subscriptions providing factual updates of changes to applicable law, regulation or accounting and auditing standards.
Whilst we cannot be definitive of every instance, for any non-audit service to be approved, it must be an audit related service (as defined above), or be very close one of these examples, and where it is clear there are no auditor independence concerns.
2.  Prohibited non-audit services:
The Group’s auditors will not be appointed to provide any of the prohibited non-audit services in:
I. the period between the beginning of the period audited and the issuing of the audit report; and
II. the financial year (or period if longer than one year) immediately preceding the period referred to in point (I) in relation to the services listed in points (e) and (h) below.
For these purposes, prohibited non-audit services shall mean:
(a) tax services relating to:
(i) preparation of tax forms;
(ii) payroll tax;
(iii) customs duties
(iv) identification of public subsidies and tax incentives unless support from the audit firm in respect of such services is required by law;
(v) support regarding tax inspections by tax authorities unless support from the audit firm in respect of such inspections is required by law;
(vi) calculation of direct and indirect tax and deferred tax; or
(vii) provision of tax advice;
(b) services that involve playing any part in the management or decision-making of the audited entity;
(c) bookkeeping and preparing accounting records and financial statements;
(d) payroll services;
(e) designing and implementing internal control or risk management procedures related to the preparation and/or control of financial information or designing and implementing financial information technology systems;
(f) valuation services, including valuations performed in connection with actuarial services or litigation support services;
(g) legal services, with respect to:
(i) the provision of general counsel;
(ii) negotiating on behalf of the audited entity; or
(iii) acting in an advocacy role in the resolution of litigation;
(h) services related to the audited entity's internal audit function;
(i) services linked to the financing, capital structure and allocation, and investment strategy of the audited entity, except providing assurance services in relation to the financial
statements, such as the issuing of comfort letters in connection with prospectuses issued by the audited entity;
(j) promoting, dealing in, or underwriting shares in the audited entity; and
(k) human resources services, with respect to:
(i) management in a position to exert significant influence over the preparation of the accounting records or financial statements which are the subject of the statutory audit, where
such services involve:
-  searching for or seeking out candidates for such position; or
-  undertaking reference checks of candidates for such positions;
(ii) structuring the organisation design; and
(iii) cost control.
3. Approval
The Group’s auditors may be appointed to provide the permitted non-audit / additional services,  as summarised in paragraph 1 above, provided that:
(a) the fees payable to the auditors in respect of services outlined in paragraph 1(b) must not exceed 70% of the average audit fee for the last three years in the aggregate, (the “non- audit services fee cap”);
(b) each appointment of the auditors to provide any such services must be approved by the Group Finance Director or the Group Financial Controller;
(c) any individual appointment for services in excess of £20,000 must first be approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Group’s Board (the “Audit Committee”), with the Chairman having discretion on whether to seek approval of the Audit Committee;
(d) any individual appointment for services in excess of £100,000 must first be approved by the Audit Committee; and
(e) a summary of the fees paid in each of the first and second half of each year shall be presented to the Audit Committee at its first meeting after each such period end.  Any proposal to appoint the Group’s auditors to provide non-audit services which will breach the aggregate fee limit referred to above will require the prior approval of the Audit Committee.
4. Scope
Whole Group.
5. Guidance
This policy will be reviewed by the Audit Committee at least annually and will also be updated to reflect changes in laws and regulations.
Remuneration Policy
Croda’s remuneration policy was adopted by shareholders at the Company’s 2020 Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2020 and is intended to operate until its expiration the Company's 2023 Annual General Meeting.
The Policy was developed over the course of 2019 and early 2020.  The Committee undertook a thorough review of arrangements with a particular focus on alignment to Croda’s forward strategy and aspirations.  Input was received from the Chair and management while ensuring that conflicts of interest were suitably mitigated. The Committee also considered carefully corporate governance developments, particularly in the area of pensions. Input was provided by the Committee’s appointed independent advisors throughout the process.
Extensive shareholder consultation was undertaken during the second half of the year in good time for shareholder input to feed into the finalisation of proposals in early 2020.
The main changes to the Policy, as detailed on page 74 of the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts, are:
Reduction of the pension cash supplement for the CEO and GFD to 20% aligned to our UK workforce
Introduction of sustainability metrics, incorporating NPP, into the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the introduction of an EVA underpin
Increased level of normal PSP awards for Executive Directors from 200%/150% to 225%/175% for the CEO and GFD respectively
Increased shareholding guidelines and introduction of post-employment shareholding requirements.
Other minor changes have been made to improve the operation and effectiveness of the Policy.
Remuneration Policy table
The table below sets out the main components of Croda’s Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors:
Operation
Maximum opportunity
Framework used to assess performance and for the recovery of sums paid
Basic salary – to assist in the recruitment and retention of high-calibre Executives
Normally reviewed annually with increases effective from 1 January. Base salaries will be set by the Committee, considering:
The performance and experience of the individual concerned
Any change in scope, role and/or responsibilities
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Rates of inflation and market-wide wage increases across international locations
The geographical location of the Executive Director
Rates of pay in international manufacturing and pan-sector companies of a comparable size and complexity.
Salaries may be increased each year in percentage of salary terms.
The Committee will be guided by the salary increase budget set in each region and across the workforce generally.
Increases beyond those linked to the region of the Executive Director or the workforce as a whole (in percentage of salary terms) may be awarded by the Committee at its discretion. For example, where there is a change in responsibility, experience or a significant increase in the scale of the role and/or size, value or complexity of the Group.
The Committee retains the flexibility to set the salary of a new hire at a discount to the market level initially, and to implement a series of planned increases in subsequent years, in order to bring the salary to the desired positioning, subject to individuals performance.
The Committee considers individual salaries taking due account of the relevant factors set out in this Policy, which includes individual performance.
Benefits – to provide competitive benefits to act as a retention mechanism and reward service
The Group typically provides the following benefits:
Company car (or cash allowance)
Private fuel allowance
Private health insurance and other insured benefits
Other ancillary benefits, including relocation expenses/arrangements (including tax thereon) as required.
Additional benefits might be provided from time to time (for example in circumstances where an Executive Director is deployed to, or recruited from overseas).
The Committee will consider whether the payment of any additional benefits is appropriate and proportionate when determining whether they are paid.
The cost of benefits is not pre- determined and may vary from year to year based on the cost to the Group.
None.
Performance related annual bonus – to incentivise and reward delivery of the Group’s key annual objectives and to contribute to longer term alignment with shareholders
Normally one third of any bonus paid is compulsorily deferred into shares for three years through the Deferred
Bonus Share Plan (DBSP). The Committee has the discretion to permit DBSP awards to benefit from dividends on shares that vest.
The balance of the bonus is paid in cash.
Group Chief Executive: 150% of salary.
Other Executive Director: 125% of salary.
Bonus will typically be based on challenging financial targets set in line with the Group’s KPIs (for example profit growth targets).
The Committee has the flexibility to include, for a minority of the bonus, targets related to other Group measures where this is considered appropriate.
For a profit measure, bonus normally starts to accrue once the threshold target is met (0% payable) rising on a graduated scale to 100% for outperformance. Were an additional KPI metric to be introduced, the threshold would not exceed 25%.
The Committee applies a Discretion Framework, which includes health, safety and environmental performance when determining the actual overall level of individual bonus payments and it may adjust the bonus awards if it considers it appropriate to do so.
Bonuses paid are subject to provisions that enable the Committee to recover value overpaid through the withholding of variable pay
previously earned or granted (malus) or through requesting a payment from an individual (clawback) in the event of a misstatement of results, serious misconduct, serious reputational damage or material corporate failure. The provisions will operate for a three-year period following the date on which the bonus is paid.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) – to incentivise and reward the execution of business strategy over the longer term and to reward sustained growth in profit and shareholder value
The PSP provides for awards of free shares (i.e., either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which vest after three years subject to continued service and the achievement of challenging performance conditions. Shares are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The Committee has the discretion to permit awards to benefit from the dividends paid on shares that vest.
Normal maximum opportunity of:
Group Chief Executive: 225% of salary
Other Executive Director: 175% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment), awards may be granted up to 300% of salary to compensate for value forfeited from a previous employer.
Granted subject to a blend of challenging financial (e.g. EPS), shareholder return (e.g. relative TSR) and strategic targets (e.g. sustainability). The performance targets may also include an additional underpin (e.g. an EVA underpin).
Targets will normally be tested over three years.
In relation to financial targets (e.g. EPS growth and TSR) 25% of awards subject to such targets will vest for threshold performance with a graduated scale operating through to full vesting for equalling, or exceeding, the maximum performance targets (no awards vest for performance below threshold). In relation to strategic targets or underpin targets, the structure of the target will vary based on the nature of target set (e.g. for milestone strategic targets it may not always be practicable to set such targets using a graduated scale and so vesting may take place in full for strategic targets if the criteria are met in full).
Vesting is also dependent on application of the Discretion Framework, including satisfactory underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period and the Committee may adjust outcomes if it considers it appropriate to do so.
There are also provisions that enable the Committee to recover value overpaid through the withholding of variable pay previously earned or granted (malus) or through requesting a payment from an individual (clawback) in the event of a misstatement of results, serious misconduct, serious reputational damage or material corporate failure. The provisions will operate for a three-year period following the date on which the PSP awards vest.
All-employee share plans – to encourage retention and long-term shareholding in the Company and to provide all employees with the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company on similar terms
Periodic invitations are made to participate in the Group’s Sharesave scheme and Share Incentive Plan.
Shares acquired through these arrangements have significant tax benefits in the UK subject to satisfying certain HMRC requirements.
The plans can only operate on an all-employee basis.
The plans operate on similar terms but on a non-tax favoured basis outside the UK as appropriate.
In the event that Croda were to introduce an all-employee plan similar in nature to the current Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan, the Committee retains the discretion to allow Executive Directors to participate on the same basis as other employees.
In relation to HMRC plans (or equivalent) the maximum participation level is as per HMRC limits. For any other all-employee plan the maximum will be equivalent to the maximum applying to all employees.
There are no post-grant targets currently applicable to the Group’s Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan.
Pension – to provide competitive long-term retirement benefits and to act as a retention mechanism and reward service
Pension benefits are typically provided either through (i) participation in the UK’s defined benefit pension plan with a cash supplement provided above any pension salary cap or (ii) a cash supplement provided in lieu of pension.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Career average revalued earnings scheme (CARE) with a maximum 1/60th accrual up to a capped salary plus cash allowance of 20% of salary above the cap or cash allowance of 20% of salary.
None.
Legacy arrangements
For the current CEO, and in line with other employees, there is a legacy capped defined benefit pension scheme. While there are no future accruals, the arrangement remains inflation-linked.
Annual Bonus Plan and Long-Term Incentive Policy
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan, DBSP, PSP and all-employee plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation and administration of these plans. These include the following (performance targets restricted to the descriptions detailed in the preceding policy table):
Who participates in the plans
The timing of grant of award and/or payment
The size of an award and/or payment
The determination of vesting
Dealing with a change of control (e.g. the timing of testing performance targets) or restructuring
Determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen
Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends)
The annual review of performance conditions for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP
For DBSP, the extension of the length of the deferral period.
The Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings for the Annual Bonus Plan and for the PSP if events occur (e.g. material divestment of a Group business or changes to accounting standards) which cause it to determine that an adjustment or amendment is appropriate so that the conditions achieve their original purpose.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy to aid its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approvals (e.g. for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation).
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting
Under the Annual Bonus Plan, an underlying profit-based objective such as profit growth will be used as the primary performance metric. Such a measure will be used as it aligns to growth in underlying profitability. The current profit-based measure also incentivises the efficient use of working capital. Other metrics may be used in the future where it is considered that they provide clear alignment with the evolving strategy of the Group.
In terms of long-term performance targets, PSP awards vest subject to:
financial targets (e.g. EPS growth) that are informed by the Group’s long-term financial ambitions (e.g. long-term targeted earnings growth)
shareholder return targets (e.g. relative TSR) which provide clear alignment of interests between shareholders and Executives
strategic targets (e.g. New and Protected Products (NPP) and sustainability targets) that align to our long-term strategic ambitions (e.g. commitment to being sustainability leaders, and to grow through innovation).
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust both the measures and weightings for each PSP award, subject to the broad framework above.
Financial and shareholder return targets (e.g. profit growth for the Annual Bonus Plan and EPS growth and relative TSR for the PSP) are set based on sliding scales that take account of internal planning and external market expectations for the Group. In relation to strategic targets or underpin targets, the structure of the target will vary based on the nature of target set. Targets and underpins may be set which provide for Committee judgement in assessing the extent to which they have been met.
In addition, prior to the determination of final outcomes, the Committee will apply its Discretion Framework to enhance the rigour and consistency of any payments and to ensure they truly align to overall Group performance and the wider stakeholder experience. While the Committee anticipates that any such discretion would normally result in a reduction, the Committee reserves the right to make an upwards adjustment if considered appropriate.
Only modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of the challenging plans approved at the start of each year. No payment will be made under the Annual Bonus Plan nor will any shares vest under the PSP for performance below threshold. The Committee may reduce (but not increase) the levels of vesting for threshold performance set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors
Assumptions:
Below target = fixed pay only (base salary, benefits and pension)
On-target = 50% payable of the 2020 annual bonus and 62.5% vesting of the 2020 PSP Awards
Maximum = 100% payable of the 2020 annual bonus, 100% vesting of the 2020 PSP awards
Maximum (including share price growth) = as per maximum but including 50% share price growth of the PSP award
Salary levels (on which elements of the package are calculated) are based on those applying on 1 January 2020. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as disclosed on page 91) for the year ended 31 December 2019. The pension value is based on the assumptions used to value pensions for the emoluments table (as disclosed on page 91 of the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts) and a salary supplement in lieu of pension at 20% of salary where relevant. The Executive Directors can participate in the all-employee share plans on the same basis as other employees. The value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the graph above.
Recruitment and Promotion Policy
For Executive Director recruitment and/or promotion situations, the Committee will follow the guidelines below:
Remuneration element
Policy
Base salary
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the Group’s Remuneration Policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual. The Committee retains the flexibility to set the salary of a new hire at a discount to the market level initially, and to implement a series of planned increases in subsequent years, in order to bring the salary to the desired positioning, subject to individuals performance. Above market salaries may also be offered if the experience and calibre of the candidate is considered to justify such an approach being taken by the Committee
Benefits
Benefits in accordance with the current policy. In addition, where necessary, the Committee may approve the payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment.
Pension
Pension in accordance with the current policy. For an internal promotion, any legacy defined pension arrangements would be considered on a case by case basis.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus would operate in accordance with the current policy in terms of the maximum opportunity and performance targets, pro-rated for the period of employment as appropriate.
Long-term incentives
Share awards will be granted in accordance with the current policy in terms of maximum opportunity and performance targets. An award may be made shortly after an appointment (subject to the Company not being in a prohibited period). For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
Buy-out awards
In the case of an external hire it may be necessary to buy-out incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer). Any such buy-out would be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and performance conditions of the remuneration being forfeited. Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans within the limits detailed in the Remuneration Policy table. Awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Directors’ service contracts and payments for loss of office
Executive Directors’ service contracts are terminable by the Company on up to one year’s notice and by the Director on at least six months’ notice.
In respect of termination, the Committee’s policy is to deal with each case on its merits, in accordance with the law and any further policy adopted by the Committee at the time. In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant Director’s current salary and contractual benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of the Company.
The principal contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of a car or car allowance, private fuel allowance, pension, medical insurance and life assurance. Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
The Committee’s policy is also for contracts to contain provisions which enable the Company to terminate contracts at any time with immediate effect. The Executive Director would be entitled to receive compensation equivalent to up to twelve months’ salary plus the value of their pension benefits (currently valued at 20% of basic salary) and the value of other benefits, payable in equal monthly instalments over the full notice period or, if less, the remainder of any notice period not yet completed. Such payments would normally discontinue or reduce to the extent that alternative employment is obtained.
An Executive Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct. No payment or compensation beyond sums accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.
Payments may be made in respect of the Director’s legal and/or professional advice fees in connection with their cessation of office or employment and/or fees for outplacement assistance.
Other than in the event of a good leaver circumstance, at the discretion of the Committee, no bonus may be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under notice at the payment date. In the event that an individual does cease employment as a good leaver, bonuses would become payable subject to performance assessment, and pro-rata based on the number of complete calendar months worked in the relevant year. A portion of any bonus payable will normally be deferred into shares in line with normal policy. Good leaver circumstances include circumstances such as injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company, retirement with the Company’s agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (reflecting the circumstances that prevail at the time).
The treatment for DBSP awards previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules. DBSP awards will normally subsist, except in the circumstance where an individual is summarily dismissed. The default treatment is that deferred shares will be delivered at the normal time, although the Committee may permit the awards to vest earlier.
The treatment for PSP awards previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules. The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment. In relation to awards granted under the PSP, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company, retirement with the Company’s agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (reflecting the circumstances that prevail at the time) ‘good leaver’ status applies. If treated as a good leaver, awards will be eligible to vest subject to performance conditions, which will be measured over the performance period (unless the Committee permits the award to vest at an earlier date), and will be reduced pro-rata (unless the Committee considers it appropriate not to do so) to reflect the proportion of the period between grant and normal vesting date actually served.
Treatment of shares awarded under HMRC all-employee plans will be in line with the share plan rules.
Shareholding Guidelines
The Committee operates share ownership guidelines which apply to all Executive Directors and the Group Executive Committee. The Group Chief Executive is subject to a share ownership guideline of 225% of salary and the other Executive Directors to 175% of salary.
It is expected that the guideline will be met within a five-year time period from its adoption (or date of joining for new appointments) through a combination of share purchases and the retention of incentive shares. On the exercise of Sharesave options or the vesting of awards from the Company’s long-term incentive plans, Executives are required to retain shares awarded representing 50% of the net of tax gain until the ownership target is met or exceeded.
Executive Directors will also normally be required to retain a shareholding for two years after leaving the Company. They will be required to retain 100% of their shareholding guideline (or the actual shareholding of relevant shares on leaving, if lower) for one year after leaving employment, tapering linearly down to zero by the end of the second year. This policy will apply only to awards that vest in 2020 and beyond. The Committee has the discretion to waive this requirement in certain circumstances (e.g. compassionate circumstances).
External Appointments
Executive Directors may accept external non-executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board. It is normal practice for Executive Directors to retain fees provided for non-executive Director appointments.
Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment
The Chair and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial fixed term of three years subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice. In each case, this term can be extended by mutual agreement.  Non-Executive Directors have no entitlement to contractual termination payments. The dates of the initial appointments of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees is:
Operation
Maximum opportunity
Framework used to assess performance and for the recovery of sums paid
To provide a competitive fee which will attract those high calibre individuals who, through their experience, can further the interests of the Group through their stewardship and contribution to strategic development
Fee levels are set by reference to the expected time commitments and responsibilities, and are periodically benchmarked against relevant market comparators, as appropriate, reflecting the size and nature of the role.
The Chair and Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual fee which is paid monthly in cash and do not participate in any of the Company’s incentive arrangements or receive any pension provision.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with additional fees payable for chairmanship of the Company’s key Committees and for performing the Senior Independent Director role. Additional fees may be payable for other additional responsibilities.
All Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties (and associated tax on these expenses).
The Chair’s fee is determined by the Committee (during which the Chair has no part in discussions) and recommended by them to the Board. The Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the Chair and the Executive Directors.
Fee levels will be eligible for increases during the period that the Remuneration Policy operates to ensure they continue to appropriately recognise the time commitment of the role, increases to fee levels for Non- Executive Directors in general and fee levels in companies of a similar size and complexity.
None.
How Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy relates to the wider Group
The Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy provides an overview of the structure that operates for the Group Executive Directors and those senior Executives forming the Group Executive Committee (noting, however, that there are some differences in PSP participation and application of holding periods and shareholding requirement, within this group).
The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the Group when setting the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors. The key difference is that, overall, the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership, than for other employees.
The alignment of Executive Director pensions with those of the UK workforce was a key consideration for the review of the Remuneration Policy. The UK workforce pension scheme is a generous and inclusive benefit for our UK workforce. With the reduction in the cash supplement for incumbent Executive Directors, pension arrangements for Executive Directors are now considered to be aligned with those across the UK workforce.
Base salaries are operated under the same policy as detailed in the Remuneration Policy table with any comparator groups used as a reference point, being country and/or industry specific. The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader Group and, in particular, the UK based employees when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors. The performance related bonus scheme operates on a tiered basis from 150% of salary down to 20% of salary across the most senior global grades. Outside of the most senior tiers of Executives, the PSP is not operated as this arrangement is reserved for those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence Group level performance.
However, the Committee believes in wider employee share ownership and promotes this through the operation of the HMRC tax approved all-employee share schemes which are open to all UK employees. Other similar share schemes are offered in other jurisdictions where local securities laws allow.
How the views of employees are taken into account
The Group has a diverse workforce operating globally in 34 different countries, with various local pay practices. The Group Human Resources Director updates the Committee periodically on feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group. In developing this Remuneration Policy, the Committee devoted time at the outset in considering the principles which apply to remuneration across the workforce. This included consideration of the ‘One Croda’ culture, as well as Croda’s values and purpose. While the views of the global workforce were not explicitly sought during the process, alignment across the workforce was a key theme of the review.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
In developing this Remuneration Policy, the Committee undertook an extensive shareholder consultation exercise, and the Chair of the Committee met with key shareholders to discuss the principles for the review and initial proposals. The Committee also considered emerging shareholder views in key governance areas. Feedback received during the consultation period was taken into account when developing the final Remuneration Policy.
