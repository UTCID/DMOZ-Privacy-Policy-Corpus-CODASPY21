In such cases, Sony takes measures to ensure that the 3Pís comply with Sonyís privacy policy and that such recipients (1) do not use Personal Data other than for the purposes permitted; (2) obtain and process Personal Data only on condition that they secure that Personal Data from unauthorised use and adopt and comply with similarly stringent policies and terms on Personal Data protection and use; and (3) comply strictly with applicable laws.
Where Personal Data is provided in connection with transactions connected with this site involving payments (such as payment for subscriptions), Sony may transmit Personal Data to 3Pís who are credit/fraud probability assessment agencies or 3Pís who are otherwise involved in crime prevention, in order to process the acceptability of your tendered credit card or other payment methods or to combat crime, and/or to credit card and other payment processing agencies. Personal Data transmitted to those 3Pís may need to be transferred to the United States of America or other places outside the European Economic Area, for processing and related purposes. Some agencies have advised that transmitted Personal Data will also be used to generate credit, risk or fraud possibility assessments for Sony and other third parties with whom you may enter into transactions. Sony may use, process and disclose without restriction any anonymous or generic data (including statistics) in which you cannot be identified.
You may request Sony to inform 3Pís to whom Personal Data has been communicated of corrections or deletions to that Personal Data. If Sony does not have control of that Personal Data, Sony will use its reasonable efforts to communicate your corrections and deletion requests. However, where Personal Data has been transferred to credit card payment and certain other agencies for payment processing, you may need to contact such agencies directly if you wish Personal Data transferred to those agencies to be rectified or deleted. Sony cannot assume, and excludes all, responsibility for rectifying or deleting Personal Data which has been transferred (with your consent) to certain agencies such as credit or fraud probability assessment, and payment processing agencies, who require and/or assume control of that data. Sony accepts no liability for any incorrect credit or other assessments generated by such 3Pís, or any other consequences (including adverse credit ratings) of Personal Data disclosed and used as contemplated in the ìPersonal Dataî (or similarly entitled) part of the registration/data input form or telephone registration process for this site, and these Terms.
