Upon reasonable prior written notice to you (with e-mail sufficing), CLIA reserves the right to change its Billing Provisions whenever necessary, in its sole discretion.

CLIA’s authorization to provide and bill for the Promotional Materials, Certification and Training Courses and Agency Membership is obtained by way of your electronic signature or, where applicable, via physical signature and/or voice affirmation. Once an electronic signature is submitted, this electronic order constitutes an electronic letter of agency. CLIA’s reliance upon your electronic signature was specifically sanctioned and written into law when the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Transactions Act were enacted in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Both laws specifically preempt all state laws that recognize only paper and handwritten signatures.
6. TRAVEL AGENT FINDER; NON-ENDORSEMENT
The Travel Agent Finder enables Site visitors (“Visitors”) to search for Agency Members using search criteria including zip code, country and proximity to the Visitor. Use of the Travel Agent Finder is subject to the following disclaimers:
(a) CLIA does not sponsor, recommend or endorse any Agency Member that is accessible by or through the Travel Agent Finder. The Travel Agent Finder facilitates communication between Visitors and Agency Members. CLIA does not guarantee that Visitors will successfully find a travel agent through the Travel Agent Finder.
(b) Please use caution and common sense when using the Travel Agent Finder. CLIA does not review the standing of any Agency Members with any regulatory authority or certifying authority. Therefore, CLIA makes no representation regarding the status, standing or ability of any Agency Member. When considering obtaining services from an Agency Member, Visitors should independently confirm that Agency Member’s standing with the applicable regulatory and/or certifying authorities.
(c) CLIA does not involve itself in the agreements between Visitors and Agency Members or the actual provision of travel agent services in connection with the relationships created thereby. Therefore, CLIA does not make any representations regarding the competency, trustworthiness, honesty, integrity and/or behavior of either its Visitors or Agency Members. Each Visitor, and not CLIA, is solely responsible for assessing the competency, trustworthiness, honesty and integrity of all Agency Members that the Visitor contacts, or is contacted by, through use of the Travel Agent Finder.
7. CONTENT

CLIA does not control the Content provided by Third-Party Content Providers that is made available by and through the CLIA Offerings. Such Third-Party Content Providers are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness and/or usefulness of such Content. The Content should not necessarily be relied upon. CLIA does not represent or warrant that the Content and other information posted by and through the CLIA Offerings is accurate, complete, up-to-date or appropriate. You understand and agree that CLIA will not be responsible for, and CLIA undertakes no responsibility to monitor or otherwise police, Content provided by Third-Party Content Providers. You agree that CLIA shall have no obligation and incur no liability to such end-users in connection with any Content. You may find certain Content to be outdated, harmful, inaccurate and/or deceptive. Please use caution, common sense and safety when using the Content.
8. CLIA’S CRUISE INDUSTRY POLICIES
CLIA promotes various Cruise Industry Policies as a way to help foster a safe, secure and healthy cruise ship environment. While CLIA promotes these practices and Cruise Industry Policies, it does not itself, nor through its Cruise Line Members and/or Agency Members, undertake to develop or enforce industry standards. CLIA does not independently test, evaluate, inspect, verify or certify the safety or potential risks of any services or goods provided by its Cruise Line Members and/or Agency Members, nor does it undertake to warn consumers about the safety or potential risks in connection with the services or goods provided by its Cruise Line Members and/or Agency Members. All users should consult applicable federal, state, local and international laws and regulations when evaluating such goods/services. CLIA does not, by the publication of its Cruise Industry Policies, intend to urge action that is not in compliance with applicable laws, and CLIA’s Cruise Industry Policies may not be construed as doing so.
In issuing and making available CLIA’s Cruise Industry Policies, neither CLIA nor its Cruise Line Members and/or Agency Members undertake to render professional advice or other services for or on behalf of any person or entity. CLIA does not assume any duty to perform legal obligations of any of its Cruise Line Members and/or Agency Members. Anyone implementing CLIA’s Cruise Industry Policies should rely on his or her own independent judgment or, as appropriate, seek the advice of a competent professional in determining the exercise of reasonable care in any given circumstances. Any certification or other statement of compliance with the terms of CLIA’s Cruise Industry Policies shall not be attributable to CLIA and is solely the responsibility of the certifier or maker of the statement.
9. PROMOTIONS
From time-to-time, CLIA may make certain Promotions available to end-users. By providing true and accurate information in connection with the applicable Promotion Form(s), responding to all Promotions-related communications from CLIA and/or the applicable Cruise Line Member and agreeing to the terms and conditions applicable to each Promotion, end-users can obtain, or attempt to obtain, entries for the chance to win prizes in the applicable Promotion(s). Each end-user understands and agrees that CLIA shall not be liable to such end-user or any third party for any claim in connection with that end-user’s participation in any of the Promotions.
10. SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES
The Site contains links to the various CLIA Social Media Pages. The Social Media Pages are hosted and made available on third party websites (“Social Media Websites”) by third party entities. Your use of Social Media Pages and Social Media Websites shall be governed by those Social Media Websites’ applicable agreements, terms and conditions. You understand and agree that CLIA shall not be liable to you, any other User or any third party for any claim in connection with your use of, or inability to use, the Social Media Pages and/or Social Media Websites.
11. INTERACTIONS
End-users are solely responsible for their interactions with other end-users, Visitors, Agency Members, Third-Party Providers, Cruise Line Members and third parties featured by and through the CLIA Offerings. Because CLIA is not involved in interactions with other end-users and third parties, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more end-users, Visitors, Agency Members, Third-Party Providers, Cruise Line Members and/or other third-parties, you hereby release CLIA from any and all claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of, or in any way connected with, such disputes.

20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS
The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles). Should a dispute arise concerning the CLIA Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties in New York, NY, in accordance with the then current commercial arbitration rules of a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties; and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice . We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice ("Final Settlement Offer"). If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, you can submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration. For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys' fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.
To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against CLIA and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that CLIA incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.
21. MISCELLANEOUS.
Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent that anything in or associated with any CLIA Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that there is any inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions and: (a) any Official Contest Rules, insofar as an applicable Promotion is concerned, the Official Contest Rules shall govern; and (b) any Agency Member Agreement, insofar as Agency Membership is concerned, the applicable Agency Member Agreement shall govern. Our failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement. CLIA may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice to you. The Agreement, may not however, be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under the Agreement. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.
