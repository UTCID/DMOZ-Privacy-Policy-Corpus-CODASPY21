contiguous 48 states of the USA and DC. For Customers in Alaska, Hawaii,
Guam ,Puerto Rico, or the US Virgin Islands free shipping via USPS is
available only on ink ribbons. While shipping and handling charges are calculated
in the online cart or checkout page according to UPS or USPS rates we
reserve the right to ship by the carrier of our choice with
similar service such as FedEx or USPS without notice. Shipping is computed from different shipping points
for different items. Some items may ship directly from the manufacturer or
some other source in another city or state. Orders with more than one item
may ship separately from different points.
Express Time Systems shall
not be held responsible for loss or damage resulting from the means of
shipment or routing used or delays in shipment beyond our control, or for
any losses or damages arising while in transit. Purchaser agrees to make any
claim therefore directly against the carrier and not against Express Time
Systems. The possibility exists that our shopping cart system may not
compute a shipping rate for some or all shipping methods to your
location. This does not mean your purchase will ship for free.
Rather, it means we will have to contact you regarding the error and
advise you of the charges involved. For heavy items or quantity orders other shipping methods can
be arranged by telephone by calling 1-800-858-7462 or by emailing
orders@expreesstimesystems.com.
Free Shipping

lookup, ALL items in your cart must be items that qualify for free
shipping. Separate orders must be placed to get items that include shipping in their price and items that do not include shipping.
Items
that include "Free Shipping" or marked "qualifies for free
shipping", are shipped to the contiguous 48 states of the USA and DC
only. For Customers in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, US Virgin
Islands, or Guam free shipping via USPS is available only on ink
ribbons and a few small quantity time card items.. Items are shipped via the method of
OUR choosing which can be UPS Ground, FedEx Ground, UPS Priority

Availability
Each item notes an "Availability" and "Ships from" designation. The
availability stated is the number of business days it NORMALLY takes to
process your order before it is shipped. An availability of "Special Order"

from" helps you to determine the number of ground shipment days it will take
according to the UPS Time in Transit Maps provided at the bottom of the
shopping cart page.
We will make every effort to assure that your order is shipped in a timely
manner. However, some products offered are not stocked, while some normally
stocked items may be temporarily out of stock. Most orders are shipped
directly from the manufacturer to you. If time of delivery is of great
concern, please call regarding current availability of specific items.
SELECTING NEXT DAY AIR SERVICE DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER
TOMORROW
. All items are subject to availability from the
manufacturer, delays in transit, and other causes beyond our control. We do
not guarantee delivery of any item within any specific time period or on a
specific day. However, we do strive to process your order in a timely
fashion and make every effort to assure our availability times are accurate.
