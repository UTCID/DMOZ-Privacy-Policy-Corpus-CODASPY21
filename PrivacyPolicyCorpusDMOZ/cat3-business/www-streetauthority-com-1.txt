Privacy Policy
Your privacy concerns are important to us. We’ve created this statement in order to fully demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices that we use when you’re visiting our Website.
Information We Collect
We collect personal information to provide our Services as well as some non-personal information about visitors to the Website. We use the term “personal information” to mean (1) information that can be used to determine, distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, e-mail address, address, phone number, age, and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical and employment information.
We collect personal and non-personal information in the following ways:
Personal information you give us: We may obtain personal information about you ONLY if you elect to give us that information. We may request personal information to provide you our Services or enable you to purchase goods or services available on the Website. Types of personal information we may ask you to provide may include the following:
Name
Zip code
Country
Telephone number
E-mail address
Mailing address
Credit card number and expiration date (for online purchases)
You must provide us with a valid email address at all times, as that will be how we communicate with you regarding all aspects of the Website, Program, and Services.
Non-personal Information we may collect: We may also collect information or data in a form that does not by itself permit us to associate it with any specific individual, which we treat as “non-personal information” in this Policy. For example, we may collect information regarding visitors the Website to help us provide more useful information to visitors and Program participants and to understand which parts of the Website and our Services are of most interest.
E-mail Address
Your e-mail address is unique and when linked to your subscription, gives an added level of security when you access your account. We do not collect your e-mail address unless you specifically provide it to us.
When you register online, we offer a selection of e-mail preferences and services from which you may choose the type of e-mail you would prefer to receive. Preferences include market updates, free e-zines, service-related matters, special offers relating to your subscription, special offers from the publisher and sometimes offers from affiliate companies that we believe may be of interest to you.
You may modify your selections at any time from the Subscriber Services section of the Website via the “My Account” link. Additionally, every promotional e-mail we send includes a way for you to opt out of receiving similar messages in the future.
Postal Address
If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about new products and services or upcoming events. You may also receive postal mailings from other reputable organizations that offer products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Outside of these organizations, we will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority.
Telephone Numbers
It’s very rare that we might contact you by telephone. But we may do so if we have a question about your order or if we discover an opportunity that may interest you. We do not rent your telephone number to other organizations.
