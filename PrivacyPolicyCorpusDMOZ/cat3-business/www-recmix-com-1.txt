Recycle
We are committed to leading our industry into a more sustainable future. We have developed innovative metal recovery processes for carbon and stainless-steel slags and aluminum dross. We help our customers capture valuable iron, nickel and aluminum that can be recycled directly into the metal production process. Recycling these metals on-site reduces costs for sourcing virgin material and the associated environmental impacts.

Reuse
We create a wide range of eco-products from the by-products of the steel production process and other industries. Some of our products, like metallurgical additives and refractories can be utilized on our steel customers’ sites, while others are utilized in other industry applications like asphalt, fertilizers, cement additives, and construction aggregates. These zero-waste solutions preserve natural resources and reduce or eliminate landfill disposal.
