THIS WEBSITE TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT, TOGETHER WITH ALL AMENDMENTS, AND COLLECTIVELY WITH ALL NATROL RULES AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THE NATROL PRIVACY POLICY, CONSTITUTE THE “AGREEMENT” BETWEEN YOU AND NATROL REGARDING YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE NATROL WEBSITE (“WEBSITE”).

IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE AGREEMENT, DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT, OR ARE NOT ABLE TO CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT (E.G., IF YOU ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO A BINDING LEGAL CONTRACT), DO NOT USE OUR WEBSITE.
1.Scope and Acceptance
Anyone who accesses or uses our Website is an “End User.”
The Agreement sets forth your rights and obligations as an End User with respect to your access to and use of the Website and use of any and all information or data of any kind arising from access to, or use of, the Website, including, without limitation, any text, graphics, images, art work, sound recordings, audio, video, and software.

2. Privacy Policy
Please see our Privacy Policy for a detailed description of how we collect, use, and disclose information about our End Users.
3. Description of Website
The Website, owned by Natrol and hosted by a third party, provides End Users with a direct-to-consumer ecommerce experience where Users can explore, compare, and purchase Natrol products.
End Users arrive on the Home Page where they can interact with four different categories: “Shop by Benefit”; “Shop by Ingredient”; “Kids Melatonin”; and “Health Tips and Tools.”
The first two categories contain drop-down menus, where the End User can select the precise subcategory they wish to explore. Certain categories include a coupon to be used in participating brick-and-mortar stores, which is discussed in Section 14.1 below.
The Home Page for each sub-category will feature different products.
By hovering over a product, the End User will see a brief overview of the product (including price) and three buttons: “Add to Cart”; “Learn More”; and “Add to Compare”.
[Only registered End Users (described in Section 6.1 below) are able to employ the “compare” function, where multiple products can be compared for their similarities and differences.]
Clicking on the product will bring the End User to the product’s page, where information such as strength and count are provided, in addition to Product Description, Product Details, and other products recommended by Natrol based on the End User’s interest in said product.
After a product is added to an End User’s cart, the product may be purchased.
The End User will be required to (1) enter an email address and a shipping address; (2) select a shipping method; (3) enter a billing address; and (4) enter credit card information.
After payment, the End User will receive a Purchase Confirmation email regarding the order.
