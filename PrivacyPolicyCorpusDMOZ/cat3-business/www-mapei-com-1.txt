Dispute Resolution – Arbitration, No Class Actions PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. You and MAPEI agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.
This provision applies to all users of the Site and consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law.
By accepting these terms, you and MAPEI expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.
The arbitrator, and not any local, state or federal court, has the exclusive authority to resolve any and all disputes arising between us, including any dispute relating to the interpretation, scope, enforceability, or formation of this agreement to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable.
This Section covers any and all disputes between us (“Disputes”), including without limitation:claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;claims that arose before this agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; andclaims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or MAPEI’s (or any of MAPEI’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property; andin addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.
References in this Section 20 to "MAPEI," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, corporate parents, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or prior agreements between us.
This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
This agreement to arbitrate provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.
You and MAPEI agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.
Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).
Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). MAPEI will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.
You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Legal Affairs, c/o MAPEI Corporation, 1144 E. Newport Center Drive, Deerfield Beach, Florida 33442; Attention: Legal Department.B. Binding Arbitration.
If you and MAPEI are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or MAPEI may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND MAPEI ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send MAPEI a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then MAPEI will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
You and MAPEI may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.C. Restrictions.
You and MAPEI agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between MAPEI and you individually, regardless whether the relief sought is monetary or injunctive relief, and any relief awarded in arbitration shall be applicable only to you in your individual capacity.
To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) no Dispute shall be arbitrated on a class basis or utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or on behalf of any person other than yourself. YOU AND MAPEI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and an authorized representative of MAPEI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.D. Location.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Broward , State of Florida, United States of America, and you and MAPEI agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.E. Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.
If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against MAPEI and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than MAPEI's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then MAPEI will: Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; andReimburse all of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees that you paid to the AAA.
Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and related expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), but the arbitrator will have authority to award attorneys’ fees and expenses if such an award is available under applicable law.F. Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.G. Changes to This Provision.
