Order troubleshooting tips
Your business is important to us. If you are receiving an error message or having other difficulties completing your online order, please read through the suggestions below.
Unsure if your order went through? Sometimes an order will be successfully submitted even if you receive an error message on the last step. Please check the list of recent orders in your account to see if your order was placed before attempting to place the order again.
Empty Shopping Cart. If your shopping cart is empty or items are missing from it, it is likely that you are not logged into your account. More information.
Can't add items. If the "Add to your products" link is not appearing on product detail pages. Your browser is not downloading the image of the "add to your products" button. Click the "Help" link at the top of your browser window (above the browser commands) to learn how to turn automatic image-loading back on. The button should then re-appear.
Error message on payment page. Make sure that you have selected the correct credit card type and expiration date from the drop-down boxes. Verify that the credit card number was entered correctly, without any spaces or dashes.
ZIP code and state do not match. Make sure you have entered the ZIP code without any spaces. To verify that the ZIP code is correct, visit http://www.usps.com/zip4/. If you are shipping to International address and your address does not contain a zip code, please enter 000.
U.K. or German postal code not accepted. If you are shipping an order to the U.K., be sure to include the space in the postcode. You may also need to enter the fourth or fifth character as a zero (0) rather than a capital letter "O". If you are shipping an order to Germany, leave the "D" out of the postal code. For example, if the code is D-12345, enter just 12345.
Page keeps looping back or is not updating. If you are being looped back to the same page on the order form, or the form is not updating when you make changes, your Web browser may be caching or storing an old copy of the page. You can force your browser to update the page by holding down the Shift key on your keyboard and simultaneously clicking on the "Reload" or "Refresh" button on your browser.
System Error. These errors usually occur for only a short time. Please return to our Web site and try again later.
Other troubleshooting tips. If your problem is not listed above, it's possible that one of these suggestions may help:
Refresh the page. If a page loads only halfway or takes a very long time to load, clicking the "Stop" button at the top of your browser and then clicking "Reload" or "Refresh" often solves the problem.
Clear your cache. Most Web browsers temporarily store a local copy of every page you visit. Clearing your cache deletes those files and makes room for new ones. Go to the "Cache" or "Temporary Internet Files" option on your browser (on Netscape, go to "Options" and choose "Network Preferences"; if you use Internet Explorer, go to "Tools" and choose "Internet Options"), and delete the files stored in your cache.
Try submitting your order via fax. Print the Order Form via the Adobe print button, complete it and fax it to us. We will contact you with your order total, prior to placing your order.
If none of these suggestions solves your problem, please contact us using the link below. Please include as much information in your message as possible, including:
What point in the ordering process is causing you trouble?
If you are receiving an error message, what does it say?
What items are you trying to order?

Privacy policy
Please see our Privacy Policy page
Troubleshooting failed authorizations and payment declines
To protect your security and privacy, your bank cannot provide AIAG with information about why your payment was declined. Because of this, you most likely need to contact your bank directly to solve most payment issues.
AIAG Customer Service can help you:
Verify if your credit card was charged
Change the card used for the purchase
Cancel an existing order
Place your order
Contact your bank to resolve other payment issues even if:
You've successfully used the payment method on a previous order.
You have funds available in your bank or credit account to cover the order cost.
Here are steps you can take to resolve payment issues:
Contact your bank about payment security policies. Your bank may flag any unexpected activity on your account. This includes first time orders and high value purchases, regardless of the amount of funds available (or credit limit). Your bank may require your verbal authorization to proceed with a transaction.
Contact your bank about daily withdrawal or purchase limits. Most banks have limits on how much money can be charged or accessed in a single day. If you exceed this daily amount, your bank may block your account from any further activity regardless of available funds in the account. Your bank may require you to request a higher purchase limit to complete the transaction.
Contact your bank to see if AIAG is set up as an authorized merchant. Our merchant type comes across as a retail purchase and some banks put a block on charges until the vendor is approved.
Verify the payment information entered on your order. Did your billing address change recently or did you get a new card with a new expiration date?
Submit an alternate payment method for your order. If you are unable to resolve the payment issue with your bank in a timely manner, you are always welcome to change the payment method on your order. You can place a quote online and then issue payment via check, wire transfer or ACH (Automated Clearing House payment) by contacting the AIAG office.

AIAG Single User e-Document & Corporation Subscription Overview and FAQS

I accidentally purchased the wrong document.

I am unable to open the document, what do I do?
AIAG e-Documents can be opened by clicking on the title of the document in the my e-Documents page.
The file should open in a new browser window.

When will access to my e-Document(s) expire?
If you purchased your single-user e-Document(s) prior to June 1, 2008, your access will expire one year from the date of purchase. Access to single-user e-Documents purchased after June 1, 2008, will not expire.

Can I print a secure PDF, and then make copies for others in my company or department?
No. That is a violation of copyright. Documents may be shared or loaned but not reproduced in any fashion. The copyright statement on AIAG Documents reads:
"The contents of all published materials are copyrighted by the Automotive Industry Action Group unless otherwise indicated. All rights are preserved by AIAG, and content may not be altered or disseminated, published, or transferred in part of such content. The information is not to be sold in part or whole to anyone within your organization or to another company. Copyright infringement is a violation of federal law subject to criminal and civil penalties."
Why has AIAG opted to create secure PDFs with Digital Rights Management technology?
Managing access to documents based on copyright ownership and protecting content rights is imperative to the continued development and distribution of technical documents and standards. Many users simply don't know when they are in violation of copyright laws and this technology protects both the user and the publisher of technical information.
I purchased a document prior to 2/12/2014, downloaded the file and I am still able to view it. Will that change?
If you are able to view your file and are not having any issues you will be allowed to continue viewing your downloaded file.

Only post a message to a discussion topic when it contains information that all participants can benefit from. Do not send administrative messages, such as "remove me from the forum," through the Collaboration Workspace.
