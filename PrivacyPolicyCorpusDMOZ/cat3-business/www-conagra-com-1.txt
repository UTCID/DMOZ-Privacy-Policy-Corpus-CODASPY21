Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from Conagra Brands’ historical experience and its present expectations or projections. These risks include, but are not limited to, Conagra Brands’ ability to finance expansion or acquisition plans, share repurchase programs and general operating activities; changes in the applicable business environment, including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; regulatory and legal changes; fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials; interest rate and currency fluctuations; changes in economic and political conditions; our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets; the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs; litigation uncertainties; adverse weather conditions; and other risks discussed in Conagra Brands’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Conagra Brands undertakes no obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Revisions to the Terms. Conagra Brands may at any time, in its sole discretion and without notice, revise or modify these Terms or the Privacy Policy. You are bound by any such revisions and should periodically visit this Site to review the current Terms and Privacy Policy pages.
Health Related Information. Information accessible on this Site is for information only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Conagra Brands does not endorse or warrant the validity of any such health related statements contained on the Site or any such information contained in third party sites referenced in the Site. Information is general in nature and may be helpful to some persons but not others, depending upon their personal medical needs. You should always consult with your physician prior to changing or undertaking a new diet or exercise program. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the Site.
Site Security. Users are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Site, including without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which the user is not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (c) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the Site, overloading, flooding, spamming, mailbombing or crashing; (d) sending unsolicited e-mail, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services; (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting; (f) by using any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activity being conducted on the Site; or (g) by using or attempting to use any engine, software, tool, agent or other device or mechanism (including, without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Site other than the search engine and search agents available from Conagra Brands on this Site and other than generally available third party web browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer).

Conagra Brands may investigate occurrences that potentially involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in such violations.
Binding Arbitration. You and Conagra Brands agree that all disputes, controversies and claims related to these Terms or your use of the Site (including the Privacy Policy) (each a “Claim”), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration as described in this Section, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from JAMS, rather than by a court. The arbitration will be governed by the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.
The arbitration may be conducted in Chicago, Illinois or, upon the plaintiff's request, in the city closest to plaintiff's location where JAMS maintains an office, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties subject to these Terms and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Dispute arises from: (a) a violation of your or Conagra's intellectual property rights in any manner; (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; or (c) any claim for equitable relief; then both parties agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a Delaware state or federal court, consistent with the “Choice of Law” clause in section 16 below, and both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.
Choice of Law. Any claim relating in any way to these Terms and your use of this Site is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States of America, without regard to its choice of law provisions. For any claims not subject to the terms of the Binding Arbitration clause in section 15 above, the parties agree that jurisdiction and venue in any legal proceeding relating in any way to these Terms or this Site shall be in the state or federal courts located in Delaware.
Class Waiver. To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all Claims shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other Claims shall be consolidated or joined with your Claims, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
YOU AND Conagra Brands AGREE THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIM TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
General Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Conagra Brands and governs your use of any Conagra Brands Site. The failure of Conagra Brands to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a wavier of any such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid then such provision shall be eliminated from the Terms and the surviving terms shall remain in full force and effect. Any claims arising under these Terms must be brought within one (1) year after such claim or action or action arose or be forever barred.
