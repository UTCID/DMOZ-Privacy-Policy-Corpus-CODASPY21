International Access: Our Site is provided from the United States of America and all servers that make it available reside in the United States. The laws of other countries may differ regarding the access and use of the Site. We make no representations regarding the legality of this Site in any other country and it is your responsibility to ensure that your use complies with all applicable laws outside of the United States. The information provided within or in connection with the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject SFC to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Site or any portion of the Site, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, or other feature that SFC provides.
These Terms and Conditions were written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of these Terms and Conditions or any Content appearing on or through the Site conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.
Governing Law: By visiting or using the Site, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, shall govern these Terms and Conditions.
Dispute Resolution: READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE SUIT IN COURT.
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator can, however, award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms and Conditions as a court would. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on you and SFC, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, Albert Straus, 1105 Industrial Avenue, Ste #200, Petaluma, CA, 94952. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse the foregoing fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and SFC agree not to seek any attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose. You and SFC understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, you and SFC would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You and SFC further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
If your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, and you and SFC agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco County, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by these arbitration provisions by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address:
ATTN: Straus Family Creamery
Privacy Request
1105 Industrial Avenue
Petaluma, CA 94952
You must provide your name, address, and email, and a clear statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration provision, within the later of 30 days after your first use of the Site or within 30 days of changes, if any, being made to the Site, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate any disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of this Section. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, SFC will similarly not be bound by them. If you do not affirmatively elect to opt out as described above, your use of the Site will be deemed to be your irrevocable acceptance of these Terms and Conditions and any changes/updates to this section or otherwise.
If any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect. In the event, some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, you and SFC agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.
Class Action Waiver: READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
You agree that you and SFC will resolve any disputes, claims, or controversies on an individual basis, and that claim(s), if any, brought under these Terms and Conditions and/or in connection with the Site will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. You and SFC further agree that you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms and Conditions or in connection with the Site.
The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any of SFC’s affiliates, to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.
Questions: Should you have any questions regarding these Terms and Conditions you may contact us.
