CONDITIONS OF SALE: CARTIER U.S. E-BOUTIQUE AND CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER
1. GENERAL
The following terms and conditions and any other related rules that are adopted by Cartier and made available as provided herein (collectively, the Conditions of Sale) shall apply to all sales of products that you (the Customer or you) may order from Cartier North America, Division of Richemont North America, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware and having its corporate headquarters at 645 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10022, U.S.A. (Cartier, or referred to herein as us, our or we) on the Internet via the Cartier website, identified by the domain name www.cartier.com, and any associated mobile or digital applications that refer to these Conditions of Sale (together, the Platform) or by phone (1.800.CARTIER) via the client relations center of Cartier (the Client Relations Center).
These Conditions of Sale apply only to sales made through the Platform or by phone directly through the Client Relations Center by individuals who are citizens of, or residents living in, the continental United States of America at the time of placing the order. The Conditions of Sale applicable to any order placed through the Client Relations Center or the Platform are those in force at the time that an order has been placed on your behalf by a Cartier Ambassador (in the case of an order placed through the Client Relations Center) or at the time you place your order (in the case of an order placed through the Platform). In the case of an order placed through the Platform, when you check the I have read and I accept the Conditions of Sale box at the payment section of the Platform before placing your order with Cartier, you indicate your acceptance of these Conditions of Sale. If you refuse to accept these Conditions of Sale, you will not be able to order any Cartier products from the Platform or the Client Relations Center. Sales conducted through Cartier retail boutiques (a Cartier Retail Boutique) and/or authorized retailers are not subject to these Conditions of Sale.
Please read the Conditions of Sale and check our Platform on a regular basis to be informed of any changes. Cartier may modify the Conditions of Sale from time to time, at its sole discretion, and your continued use and/or registration following such change will signify your agreement to be bound in the future by the modified Conditions of Sale.  If you are placing an order through the Platform, then by checking the I have read and I accept the Conditions of Sale box and placing your order, you will be indicating your agreement to be bound by the Conditions of Sale as so modified through such time. Persons wishing to use the Client Relations Center or the Platform will also be deemed, by virtue of such use, to have agreed to be bound by our Platform Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, which are incorporated into these Conditions of Sale by reference.  Customers using the Client Relations Center will be provided with access to our Privacy Policy as set forth in Acknowledgment of Order below.  If you do not agree to any change to the Conditions of Sale, then you must immediately contact the Client Relations Center to cancel your registration and refrain from ordering any Cartier product through the Client Relations Center or the Platform.
2. PURCHASING ELIGIBILITY
Only individuals (and not legal entities) who (a) have reached the age of majority (eighteen in most states), (b) have legal capacity to enter into contracts and (c) are citizens of or residents living in the continental United States of America, Alaska, Hawaii or the District of Columbia may order products through the Client Relations Center or on the Platform. If you are under the age of majority or otherwise cannot lawfully enter into a contract, you must have your parent or guardian place an order on your behalf and thereby assent to these Conditions of Sale. Any orders placed in violation of this provision shall be null and void.
By placing an order through the Client Relations Center or on the Platform, you represent and warrant that you are a bona fide end-user customer and will not deliver, sell or otherwise distribute Cartier products or purchase Cartier products for commercial purposes or any other commercial benefit.
3. PRODUCT AVAILABILITY; QUANTITY
All orders placed through on the Platform are subject to availability and acceptance by Cartier.
Cartier reserves the right to change the assortment of items offered on the Platform or through the Client Relations Center, and may limit from time to time the quantity of Cartier products that may be ordered by a Customer in a single buying session, without prior notice. Cartier further reserves the right to refuse at any moment in time, without prior notice, orders exceeding a certain number of authorized products. Currently, orders may not exceed five (5) products in any buying session on the Platform or through the Client Relations Center.
The Client Relations Center and the product pages on the Platform can provide you with information regarding products that are currently available for sale through those channels. Please note that only merchandise displaying an Add to Shopping Bag icon is available for sale through the Platform. You may also call the Client Relations Center (1.800.CARTIER) and a Cartier Ambassador will provide you with further information as to product availability and assist you with your purchase.
4. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION; PERSONAL INFORMATION; GUEST CHECKOUT
In order to place an order ­on the Platform, you or the Cartier Ambassador (on your behalf) may either register and create an online account on the Platform, or place an order as a guest without creating an online account by selecting the "Guest Checkout" option. In order to create this account, you will be required to provide valid and up-to-date personal information, such as your legal name, phone number and e-mail address, and to confirm that you have reached the age of majority.
If you select the Guest Checkout option, you will have the option to create your Cartier online account upon receiving the Order Confirmation. Please note that in such case, your Cartier online account will not include transactions made prior to the creation of your account.
Upon completion of your account registration on the Platform or by the Cartier Ambassador, you will receive by email a one-time password, which will allow you to log in to your account on the Platform and create a permanent account login and password.  You will also receive a second email summarizing the personal information you provided in registering for your online account.  You are responsible for ensuring that your password and account login are kept secret, safe and secure at all times. Cartier will not be held responsible or liable for any misuse of your account in connection with, and/or resulting from, a third partys access to and use of your password and account login.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy and Section 7 of these Conditions of Sale for more details about how we may use your personal information. If you select the Guest Checkout option on the Platform, your online account will not be created and we will not use your personal information for any purpose other than in connection with processing your order.
When placing an order on the Platform you will be required to provide other personal information as applicable, such as shipping address, billing address and payment details. Additional information may be collected by Cartier or its third party providers at this time for security and anti-fraud purposes.
You represent and warrant that the personal information you provide to the Client Relations Center or via the Platform is true, valid, complete and up-to-date in all respects, and you confirm that you are the person referred to in the shipping (unless the item is a gift) and billing information provided.
Should any of the information you provide to the Client Relations Center or on the Platform change, please log in to your account and update such information directly on the Platform, inform the Client Relations Center or notify Cartier at the following e-mail address: contact.na@cartier.com, or as set out in our Privacy Policy.
5. ORDERS
If you are ordering on the Platform, orders will be processed as follows: Once you have chosen a product, click on the Add to Shopping Bag icon to place this product in your shopping bag. You may then decide to continue shopping for other products and add them to your shopping bag (subject to availability and quantity limits) or proceed to Checkout by clicking on this button. You may also remove one or several products you have selected by clicking on "X" next to the chosen product in the Shopping Bag. Once on the payment page, review your order details and personal information (including email, shipping address, billing address and payment information), check the box next to I have read and I accept the Conditions of Sale. Then, click on Pay Now to place your order.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for herein, Cartier reserves the right to refuse, cancel and terminate orders at any moment in time. For example, Cartier may refuse, terminate or cancel your order if there is an ongoing dispute concerning payment of a prior order or if Cartier suspects, in its sole discretion, that you have engaged in fraudulent or grey market activities or have otherwise violated these Conditions of Sale.
6. PRICES, TAX AND SHIPPING COSTS
All prices shown on the product pages of the Platform or quoted by the Client Relations Center are in U.S. Dollars.
Cartier reserves the right to modify prices and delivery costs at any time without prior notice.
Actual shipping costs and applicable taxes will be reflected on your payment page before you are asked to confirm and place your order (in the case of a Platform order) and will also be reflected in the Confirmation of Order. Delivery costs, if any, are described in the shipping policy set forth below. Sales and use taxes will vary based on the location to which products are being shipped. Delivery costs and estimated sales and use taxes are not stated on the product pages but will be added to the product price, if applicable, after you have chosen your delivery location and options.
The actual sales tax associated with your purchase will be calculated at the time when your order is to be shipped, at which point you will receive a Confirmation of Order. Please note that changes to applicable law between the date your order is placed and the date you are sent a Confirmation of Order may result in changes to the sales tax associated with your purchase. If the resulting change is an increase in the sales tax you are charged, we will contact you and ask that you reconfirm your purchase.
Please note that if you exchange your Cartier creation at certain Cartier boutiques you will be subject to any jurisdictional tax differences, from taxes originally paid on your Cartier creation.
7. PAYMENT BY CREDIT CARD
Cartier accepts the following credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
When ordering on the Platform, you will need to enter your payment details on the appropriate form. ­In the case of an order placed by telephone, you will need to communicate to the Client Relations Center your credit/debit card number and your three- or four- digit security code that is printed on the back or the front of your card (CVV2/CVC2/CID).  Your telephone conversation will be recorded for security and quality control purposes. Any telephone conversation recorded by our Client Relations Center that contains your credit card information will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions.
All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorize payment to Cartier, you will need to contact your card issuer directly to solve this problem, and Cartier will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery.
In order to process your order, we may perform security checks on your credit card. The full amount of your purchase will be blocked on your credit card until your order is approved by Cartier, and your credit card will be charged the applicable purchase price once your order has shipped. By submitting an offer to purchase Cartier products on the Platform or through the Client Relations Center, you expressly authorize Cartier to perform such security checks, where Cartier deems necessary, to transmit or to obtain information (including any updated information) about you to or from third parties from time to time, including but not limited to your credit-card number, to authenticate your identity, to validate your credit card, to obtain a credit card authorization and to authorize individual purchase transactions.
Cartier takes precautions  including administrative, technical, and physical measures  to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Cartier uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected. Unfortunately, transmitting information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will implement appropriate measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of the data you transmit; any transmission is at your own risk and we cannot be held liable. For more information about how we use and protect your information please view our Privacy Policy.
Cartier is prohibited under U.S. law from making sales of its goods to individuals or companies designated on the Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List, or to country destinations sanctioned by the U.S. Any such transactions will be declined.
8. PAYMENT BY PAYPAL
You may also pay by using PayPal, as indicated on the Platform.
9. PAYMENT BY WIRE TRANSFER
We only accept bank wire transfer for orders placed through the Client Relations Center. We do not charge a fee for bank wire transfers for orders made through the Platform or Client Relations Center; however, some financial institutions may charge a fee for using a bank wire transfer. We require that all bank wire transfer orders placed by telephone be confirmed through an order approval process. We may acknowledge a bank wire transfer order, but the order will not be processed until the payment has been received and confirmed by us by e-mail. If your wire transfer payment is not credited into our bank account within fourteen (14) days after you have placed your order, your order will be cancelled.
10. REVIEW AND CONFIRMATION
You should carefully check and confirm all details on the payment page before placing your order through the Platform, including without limitation the particulars of each sale. In the case of an order being placed through the Client Relations Center, the Cartier Ambassador may verbally ask you to confirm the details of your order.
11. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ORDER
Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed on the Platform, you will receive an Acknowledgment of Order by email, acknowledging the details of your order. This Acknowledgment of Order will contain an Order Reference Number assigned by Cartier. Please make sure that you save this Order Reference Number for any future enquiries regarding your order. This Acknowledgment of Order is not an acceptance of your order. Following the transmission of the Acknowledgment of Order, Cartier will conduct its usual credit, anti-fraud, security and related legal checks and, if acceptable, will then process your order.
These Conditions of Sale will be provided to you with the Acknowledgement of Order through either email link or pdf. Please carefully review these Conditions of Sale upon receipt.
12. CONFIRMATION OF ORDER
Upon shipment of your order, following completion by Cartier of its anti-fraud, security and related legal checks, Cartier will send you by email a written Confirmation of Order. The written Confirmation of Order constitutes the acceptance of your order by Cartier and indicates the existence of a binding sales contract.
13. PROOF OF AGREEMENT
The Acknowledgement of Order and Confirmation of Order that are sent to you by email are deemed to be received when you are able to access them on your computer, mobile or handheld device.
The Confirmation of Order and any automatic recording systems used by the Client Relations Center or the Platform will be proof of a binding agreement between you and Cartier.
14. COMPLIMENTARY SERVICES
The following complimentary services may be offered, free of charge, on the Platform or by the Client Relations Center Ambassador:

Cartier insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to you. We require a signature by an adult to confirm your acceptance of each Cartier product delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you understand and accept that evidence of a signature by such recipient (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery and fulfillment of the sale contract by Cartier and transfer of responsibility to the recipient in the same way as if the product had been delivered to you.
16. RETURN POLICY
In order to ensure your total satisfaction, a Customer or a recipient of a gift of Cartier products (a Gift Recipient) may return Cartier products in accordance with the return and exchange policy set forth below. Returns of Cartier products that are not in compliance with the conditions and timeframes set forth below may be rejected by Cartier and will be sent back to the Customer or Gift Recipient, as the case may be.
16.1. Return Period
Cartier creations purchased through the Cartier e-boutique or directly by phone through the Client Relations Center may be exchanged or returned for a refund or merchandise credit within thirty (30) days following delivery. Please allow up to fourteen (14) business days for full refund, if applicable. Merchandise must be presented in its original packaging and accompanied by the appropriate sales receipt. Engraved, embossed, special order, personalized, made to order creations and items that show sign of wear cannot be exchanged or returned. All returns and exchanges are subject to the further terms and conditions set forth below.
16.2. Return Process
Products that have been purchased on the Platform or through the Client Relations Center may be returned to the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center at the following address: RNA Logistics, Attention: E-Commerce Returns, 2710 Regency Drive, Suite 500, Grand Prairie, TX 75050. You are also welcome to visit a Cartier retail boutique in the United States to process the exchange or refund. Please allow several business days to see the refund on your bank statement.
Products that have not been purchased on the Platform or through the Client Relations Center ­may NOT be returned to the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center.
If a Customer or Gift Recipient wishes to return a product to the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center, then such person must comply with the following steps:
I.            Call the Client Relations Center at 1.800.CARTIER to request a Return Authorization Number (RAN). This number is required prior to returning any product originally purchased from the Cartier e-Boutique by Internet or by phone with the Client Relations Center to Cartier,
II.            Fill out the required information, list the applicable Return Authorization Number (RAN) on the return/exchange form,
III.            Include the completed return/exchange form with the product, all its accessories, the User Guide, the Warranty Card and all other documents, in its original box and delivery package,
IV.            Seal the delivery package and affix the pre-paid delivery label to it,
V.            Bring the package to any Fedex location or call Fedex to arrange pick-up.
Should the Customer or Gift Recipient decide to return a purchased item within the 30-day period, Cartier and the Customer or Gift Recipient, as the case may be, agree that Cartier maintains a special interest in the merchandise and will therefore purchase insurance on the returned merchandise. Cartier is under no obligation to do so but will take this initiative for the Customer's or Gift Recipients convenience.
The Customer or Gift Recipient, as the case may be, must keep a proof of return shipment and the FedEx tracking number, and Cartier accepts no liability in the event that such proof cannot be produced. Only merchandise received by the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center will be eligible for a refund or exchange.
Upon receiving a return, Cartier will verify that the returned product satisfies the conditions of the return policy and, if so, then proceed with the applicable refund or exchange.
16.3. Conditions to Return a Product
Cartier products must be returned in a new and unused state, in perfect condition, with all protective materials in place and tags and stickers attached to them (if applicable), as well as with the original Cartier box and delivery package, including all accessories and documents. Cartier will not accept any return if the product shows signs of wear, or has been used or altered from its original condition in any way.
Watch bracelets that have been adjusted at the Customers request must be returned with the exact same number of links as in the original delivery package.
Engraved or embossed products, as well as special order, personalized and made-to-order creations, cannot be returned to Cartier for exchange, merchandise credit or refund.
All returns will be subject to strict Quality Control (QC) by Cartier to ensure that the returned products satisfy these requirements. If the products do not meet QC standards, Cartier will refuse the return, and the products will be sent back to the Customer or the Gift Recipient, as applicable. If the returned product satisfies Quality Control (QC), Cartier will proceed with the applicable refund or exchange.
16.4. Refunds and Merchandise Credit
Should a product be returned to the Cartier e-boutique distribution center by the Customer or the Gift Recipient, a Customer is entitled to receive a refund. A Gift Recipient is not entitled to receive a refund. In no event will a merchandise credit be issued by the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center.
Should a product be returned to a Cartier Retail Boutique, the Customer or Gift Recipient are entitled to receive a merchandise credit. No refunds will be issued by a Cartier Retail Boutique; however, a Cartier Retail Boutique can facilitate the return of product to the Cartier e-boutique or Client Relations Center. Please allow up to fourteen (14) business days for full refund, if applicable
If a Customers return complies with the return policy, Cartier will use reasonable efforts to credit the refund to the Customers credit card or Paypal account no later than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the returned item by the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center. Except for delivery of a defective product, initial shipping charges will not be refunded to the Customer.
16.5. Exchanges
Customers and Gift Recipients may be permitted to exchange a product purchased on the Platform ­or by phone through the Client Relations Center for another Cartier product if the product to be exchanged satisfies the conditions of the return policy within thirty (30) days following delivery.
Cartier will send an invoice as a .pdf attachment to the Customers email address, which specifies the value of the returned product, the price of the item for which the original product has been exchanged and the difference to be paid by the Customer or the amount that the Customer is entitled to receive, as indicated below.
Should a product be returned for exchange to the Cartier e-Boutique distribution center by a Customer or Gift Recipient, only the Customer will be entitled to receive a refund of the price difference if the returned product is more expensive than the exchanged Cartier product. If the returned product is less expensive than the exchanged item, the Gift Recipient will be charged the difference in price.
Should a product be returned for exchange to a Cartier Retail Boutique, either the Customer or Gift Recipient will be entitled to receive merchandise credit of the price difference, in case the original product is more expensive than the item to be received in the exchange. If the returned product is less expensive than the exchanged item, the Customer or Gift Recipient will be charged the difference in price.
16.6. Defective products
Cartier is extremely cautious in ensuring that each product strictly complies with our quality criteria and that it has passed all our controls, both technical and aesthetic.
If nevertheless you receive a product that seems to be damaged, you may return it to Cartier in accordance with the return policy. Upon receipt, Cartier may classify the returned product as a defective product. Please note that items that are damaged as a result of wear and tear are not considered to be defective.
If your product is declared as defective by Cartier, the following solutions will be proposed to the Customer or the Gift Recipient, as applicable:
I.            Cartier may send you the same product in the exact same size, subject to availability,
II.            Cartier may propose an exchange for another Cartier creation of equivalent or higher value, in which case the initial price will be deducted and you will be required to pay only the difference, or
Only you, as the Customer, may request a refund of the full price of your initial purchase
17. REPAIRS
For any repair inquiries, please contact our Client Relations Center by emailing contact.na@cartier.com or by calling 1.800.CARTIER.
18. GIFTS
If you purchase a Cartier product as a gift for a Gift Recipient, you will receive an invoice to your email address as a .pdf attachment (Cartier will never send the invoice and payment details to the Gift Recipient).
19. PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS
We try to ensure that the information, including product descriptions, dimensions, and colours, provided on the Platform, in advertisements or catalogues or as provided by the Client Relations Center is accurate and complete. However, we make no guarantees, whether express or implied, in relation to the accuracy, reliability and completeness of such information.
20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim and exclude all other terms, conditions and warranties in relation to the products and any orders placed through the Platform or Client Relations Center, whether express or implied by statute or otherwise or arising from any previous course of dealing or usage or trade practice.
Nothing in these Conditions of Sale limits or excludes our liability for any liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law. Subject to the preceding sentence, our aggregate liability to you under these Conditions of Sale for any order whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages shall in no event exceed the one hundred percent (100%) of the price of the product(s) in your order.
Please note that in some jurisdictions, including the State of New Jersey, USA, consumer protection laws do not allow certain exclusions or limitation of warranties or liabilities, and consequently some of the above exclusions and limitations do not apply.
21. GENERAL PROVISIONS
If any provision, or part of a provision, of these Conditions of Sale is deemed to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of these Conditions of Sale shall be unaffected and shall continue to be fully valid, binding and enforceable.
These Conditions of Sale (and associated terms incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and us in relation to the order of products or services, and replace and extinguish all prior agreements, draft agreements, arrangements, undertakings, or collateral contracts of any nature made by the parties, whether oral or written, in relation to such subject matter.
We are not responsible for any failure or delay in performing or complying with our obligations under these Conditions of Sale which arises from any cause beyond our reasonable control.
The waiver by us of a breach of any provision of these Conditions of Sale will not operate to be interpreted as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
This contract is between us and you. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. However, if you purchase a product as a gift, the recipient of your gift will have the benefit of the applicable Cartier Guarantee.
22. GOVERNING LAW; AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS
These Conditions of Sale shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and, where applicable, the laws of the State of New York, without reference to conflict of laws provisions. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Conditions of Sale, including the validity, invalidity, breach or termination of the Conditions of Sale, or to any product purchased from Cartier through the Platform or Client Relations Center, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that a consumer or Cartier may assert claims in small claims court if such claims qualify. You understand and agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to defend your rights, including to a trial by jury, under these Conditions of Sale. In addition, you and Cartier understand and agree that the parties will pursue any dispute on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other consumer. You and Cartier agree that each may not bring a claim against the other as part of any class action, class arbitration, or other representative proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted in the state and county where you reside (as determined by your address on file with Cartier) or at consumers election, New York, New York, by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
Before bringing any dispute in arbitration, you and Cartier agree that you will first notify the other party and make reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve amicably any dispute or failure to agree that may arise out of or relate to the product, the Conditions of Sale or any potential or alleged breach thereof. This requirement is a pre-condition, and no claim shall be filed in arbitration (or small claims court) until this provision is first met.
