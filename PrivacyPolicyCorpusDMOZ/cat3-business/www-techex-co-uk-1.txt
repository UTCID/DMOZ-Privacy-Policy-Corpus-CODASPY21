Processing Personal Data for a Legitimate Interest
What does Legitimate interest mean?
Legitimate interest means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give our customers and channel partners the best and most secure experience. For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to your interests and which will enable you to effectively use and/or promote our products and services.
Processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Techex, the controller, or by a third party, our selected channel partners, to provide you with details relating to our products and services.
Why would we process your information for a legitimate interest?
We process personal information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following:
Where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalise or otherwise improve our products, services and communications for the benefit of our customers
To identify and prevent fraud
To enhance the security of our network and information systems
To better understand how people interact with our websites
To determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising
To protect our commercially valuable information and also our intellectual property;
To prevent and detect fraud and/or criminal activity that could be damaging for us and for you;
For credit control purposes and to make sure our customers can pay for the goods and services we provide; and
Ensuring we are able to keep up to date with our customers and contacts and developments in their organisations.
Whenever we process data on the basis of legitimate interest we will ensure that we always keep your personal data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish, and if you wish to do so please contact This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.. Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out tasks above for your benefit.
Direct Marketing
Any marketing undertaken by Techex is processed in compliance with e-privacy regulation and direct marketing best practice.
We may process personal data for direct marketing by email. If you are an existing channel partner or customer it is important that we are able to keep you updated with the latest news about Techex products, services and events. We are therefore legally allowed to send direct marketing to personal data obtained using soft opt-in consent as outlined in the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation (PECR).
Processing Personal data with Consent for direct marketing
You may freely consent to your personal data being processed by Techex for direct marketing in the following circumstances:
When you tick an optional field for opt-in on a form on the website
Where you click through to opt-in from an opt-in button in an email
When you leave a business card or have your details collected at an event/ trade show - we may verbally ask whether you consent to receive communications from us
Signing a consent statement on a paper form to receive marketing communications - you may be asked to do this at a trade show or event
Where applicable we keep clear records of where, when and how consent was obtained.
We process personal data for the purpose of direct marketing by electronic means, i.e., email. For individuals who are not current channel partners or existing customers (e.g. we may have acquired your details by purchasing a list from a third party), we require that individuals give consent - or opt-in - to receive direct marketing in accordance with applicable laws.
We ensure you have a free and fully informed choice to exercise your right to consent or actively opt-in. Where explicit consent is to be gathered we endeavour to ensure that you are fully aware of what you are consenting to and how your personal data will be used. These purposes may fall under the section Why and How do we use personal data?
You are able to withdraw your consent at any time by clicking on the Unsubscribe link in any of our email communications or you can email This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. and we will ensure that your details are deleted as requested.
Disclosing your information
We will also share your personal data with our suppliers and service providers for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. We require those third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We may also share your personal data where the disclosure is required by law.
We will also ensure that any personal data that is disclosed to us is held safely and securely.
We may disclose your personal data in these circumstances:
For any of the reasons highlighted in the section above labelled Why and How do we use personal data?
To further protect and reduce the risk of fraud
In the event that we sell any or all of our business to a buyer
Other than for the purposes communicated to you in this privacy policy, we will not share your personal information with any other third parties without your consent unless we are required to do so by law. Where disclosure to third parties is required by law, our legal basis for processing your information in this way is that it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
How long do we keep your personal data?
We do not keep any personal data for any longer than is reasonably necessary.
If you are an existing channel partner or customer, it is important that you receive product and services information to ensure you are kept informed and up to date with the latest news. We will continue holding and processing this personal data until told otherwise e.g. by unsubscribing to marketing communications.
For individuals who are not existing channel partners or end users we will keep data until consent is withdrawn, e.g. by unsubscribing to marketing communications or any other means.
Data Storage and Security
We ensure that all data is stored securely. All data is stored on secure servers within the EEA and where applicable is held in password protected accounts and accessible only by relevant personnel. A company-wide firewall is in place to ensure security.
Unfortunately, the sending of information via the internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information can be intercepted. We cannot guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically and it will be done so at your own risk.
Your personal data will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with any third parties unless in relation for a legitimate business purpose, for example, as a customer we may share your information with a relevant channel partner to assist with a specific project or as set out in this privacy policy.
Where Techex discloses personal data to third parties such as our channel partners we require them to adhere to relevant measures to ensure all personal data is protected and securely held.

If you ask us to delete your information in accordance with your rights set out below, we will retain basic information on a suppression list to record your request and to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.
