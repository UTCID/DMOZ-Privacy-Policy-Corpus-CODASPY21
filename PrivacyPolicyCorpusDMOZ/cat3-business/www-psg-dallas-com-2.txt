Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Project Services Group public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Project Services Group does not read any of your private online communications.
Project Services Group encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Project Services Group so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information.

Use of your Personal Information

Use of Cookies
The Project Services Group Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Project Services Group pages, or register with Project Services Group site or services, a cookie helps Project Services Group to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Project Services Group Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Project Services Group features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Project Services Group services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Project Services Group secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Project Services Group secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
Project Services Group will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Project Services Group encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Project Services Group is protecting your information.
