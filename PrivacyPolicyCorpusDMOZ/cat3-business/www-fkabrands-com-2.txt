Collecting other personal information

Like many web sites, the FKA Brands web sites use "cookie" technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you. Cookies help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.
In some of our email to you, we use a "click-through URL." When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.

To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every FKA Brands employee. FKA Brands does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.
If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.
The FKA Brands Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
