Protecting Personal Information
Your identity is precious, and unfortunately, that also makes it a hot commodity for thieves. But, the good news is, there are a lot of people, including us, who are working hard to protect your identity.**Current Scam**Be suspicious if you receive an automated call with a recording claiming to represent Kitsap Bank, indicating your debit card has been frozen and personal information is needed before the card can be used again. This is a variation on a scam known as “phishing” where fraudsters have been perpetuating automated calls. Should you receive such a call, hang up and do not provide your account information.ResourcesABA - American Bankers Association (Fraud Info, Consumer Education, Articles)ATG - Washington State Attorney General (Consumer Protection Programs, Internet Safety for Kids, Protecting Seniors, Fraud Fighters)BBB - Better Business Bureau – (Consumer Tips, Check a Business or Charity, File a Complaint)Credit Reporting Agencies - Equifax, Experian, Trans-UnionDOJ - Department of Justice (Fraud Information)DOL - Department of Licensing (Identity Theft FAQs)FDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (Consumer Alerts, Safe Internet Banking, Tips on Fraud)FBI - Federal Bureau Of Investigation (New Scams and Warnings, How To Protect Yourself, Parent's Guide To Internet Safety)FTC - Federal Trade Commission (Consumer and Business Information, Info on Current/New Scams, Consumer Tips, Stop SPAM, Telemarketers, Affidavit in case you are a victim, National Do Not Call Registry)NFIC - National Fraud Information Center (Telemarketing and Internet Fraud, Elder Fraud)WSBA - Washington State Bar Association (Types of Fraud, Find Legal Help)WSP - Washington State Patrol (FAQs, Identity Theft Unit)
