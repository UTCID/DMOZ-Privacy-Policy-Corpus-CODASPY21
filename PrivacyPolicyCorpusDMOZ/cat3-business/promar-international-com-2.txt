These Terms and Conditions apply to all orders for the provision of Services that the Customer places with the Supplier and sets out all the terms in relation to the Supplier supplying Services to the Customer. By signing these Conditions, agreeing a Sales Order and/or allowing the Supplier to commence the Services, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall be bound by these Conditions. Capitalised terms have the meanings given to them in Condition 19.
APPLICATION1.1 These Conditions alone shall govern and be incorporated in every Contract for the provision of Services made by or on behalf of the Supplier. They shall apply in place of and prevail over any terms or conditions contained or referred to in any documentation submitted by the Customer, in correspondence or elsewhere, or implied by trade custom, practice or course of dealing.1.2 Acceptance by the Customer of the provision of the Services shall be deemed to constitute unqualified acceptance of these Conditions.1.3 A variation of these Conditions or any Sales Order is valid only if it is in writing and signed by a director or authorised representative of the Supplier.
QUOTATIONS AND SALES ORDERS2.1 A Quotation issued by the Supplier does not constitute a Sales Order. Any Quotation is given on the basis that no Contract shall come into existence until a Sales Order is entered into between the parties. The Supplier reserves the right to withdraw or revise a Quotation at any time.2.2 Each Sales Order shall be deemed to be an offer by the Customer to buy Services subject to these Conditions. A Sales Order shall be effective only where it is in writing and signed by the Supplier. The Customer shall ensure that the terms of the Sales Order are complete and accurate.2.3 Once a Sales Order is accepted the Customer may not cancel the Contract save as set out in these Conditions.PROVISION OF SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES3.1 The Supplier will provide the Services to the Customer in accordance with the Sales Order and these Conditions.3.2 The Services will begin on or around the Start Date and shall continue unless and until the Contract is terminated in accordance with Condition 11, unless expressly specified for fixed term on the Sales Order (in which case the Services shall be provided for the fixed term, save as terminated under these Conditions).3.3 Whilst the Supplier will use reasonable endeavours to meet any milestone dates or estimated timescale set out in the Sales Order, such dates are approximate only, and time of performance is not of the essence.3.4 Any representations about the Services shall have no effect unless expressly agreed in writing and signed by a director or authorised representative of the Supplier. The Customer acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of the Supplier which is not set out in the Contract.3.5 All Services and Deliverables shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Customer unless the Customer gives the Supplier notice within five working days of receiving the Services or Deliverables that there is an issue, omission, error, defect or non-conformity with them.SOFTWARE4.1 If the Supplier agrees in a Sales Order that the Services or Deliverables include the licence of Software, the Supplier shall grant to the Customer a non-exclusive licence of the Software to the Customer provided that:4.1.1 use of the Software shall be restricted to use of the Software in object code form for the purpose of processing the Customer’s data for the normal business purposes of the Customer (which shall not include allowing the use of the Software by any person other than the Customer’s Personnel who are authorised by the Supplier to use the Software (Authorised User));4.1.2 use of the Software shall be subject to the additional terms and conditions for use of that Software made available to the Customer;4.1.3 the Customer may not use the Software other than as specified in Condition 4.1.1 without the prior written consent of the Supplier, and the Customer acknowledges that additional charges may be payable on any change of use approved by the Supplier;4.1.4 the Customer shall:4.1.4.1 ensure that the number of Authorised Users using the Software does not exceed any maximum permitted number specified by the Supplier from time to time;4.1.4.2 keep a complete and accurate record of the Customer’s copying and disclosure of the Software and its Authorised Users, and produce such record to the Supplier on request from time to time; and4.1.4.3 permit the Supplier to inspect and have access to any premises (and to the computer equipment located there) at or on which the Software is being kept or used, and have access to any records kept in connection with this Agreement, for the purposes of ensuring that the Customer is complying with the terms of this Agreement, provided that the Supplier provides reasonable advance notice to the Customer of such inspections, which shall take place at reasonable times.4.2 Where the Software is licenced by a third party (Third Party Software) as part of the Deliverables or Services:4.2.1 such use of the Third Party Software shall be subject to the terms and conditions of that Third Party Software (Third Party Terms), as supplied by the Supplier to the Customer from time to time;4.2.2 the Customer shall indemnify and hold the Supplier harmless against any Losses which it may suffer or incur as a result of the Customer’s breach of any Third Party Terms howsoever arising; and4.2.3 the Supplier may treat the Customer’s breach of any Third Party Terms as a breach of the Contract.4.3 The Supplier does not warrant that the Software will be available at all times, or will be uninterrupted or error free.4.4 The Customer agrees that it shall comply with all terms and conditions issued by the Supplier regarding any support services for the Software.CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS5.1 To enable the Supplier to perform its obligations under the Contract, the Customer shall:5.1.1 co-operate fully with the Supplier;5.1.2 provide the Supplier and the Supplier’s Personnel with any information that it reasonably requires;5.1.3 provide the Supplier and the Supplier’s Personnel with access to the Customer’s premises and equipment and the Site (including such facilities on Site as are reasonably required by the Supplier and the Supplier’s Personnel);5.1.4 provide to the Supplier and the Supplier’s Personnel with such documents, information, items and materials required by the Supplier, including any relevant Customer Materials;5.1.5 provide the Supplier and Supplier’s Personnel with copies of any health and safety, security or other policies and procedures with which the Supplier and the Supplier’s Personnel are required to comply with whilst on Site;5.1.6 obtain all necessary licences, permissions and consents which may be required before commencement of the Services;
