Security
VISTA takes care to protect the security of the personal information you provide on our website.

In general, VISTA uses personal information for the following necessary business functions:
Communicate with you directly: VISTA staff may contact you to answer your questions, inform you of job postings, share best practices and to provide any other information that you may have requested.
Enable prospective employers to get to know you: VISTA may disclose your information (qualifications, salary requirements, employment history, etc.) to interested employers so they can match your talents with their specific needs.
Support legal requirements: VISTA may disclose your information to legal authorities in cases involving threats to personal safety, fraud and other suspected or actual illegal activities.
Transfer business ownership: If VISTA or any of our subsidiaries is sold to another company, your information may be included with the sale as part of our assets.
