The California Civil Code Section 1798.100 et seq., grants consumers various privacy rights to their personal information including:
Right of access. You have the right to request access to personal data that We collect. Please note that if your access request would require the disclosure of personal data of another individual, we would not be able to comply with all of your access request. Similarly, if responding to your access request would cause G-Star to violate any law, rule, regulation, or law enforcement request, we would also be unable to fulfill your request.
Right of deletion. You have the right to request that We delete personal data that We collected from you. However, We are not required to comply with your request if it is necessary for us or our service provider to maintain your personal data in order to complete the transaction with you, detect security incidences, identify and repair errors, exercise free speech, comply with the CA
Electronic Communications Privacy Act, engage in certain public interest research, use internally so long as reasonably aligned with your expectations, comply with a legal obligation or otherwise use your personal data internally so long as it is compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Right to opt-out. You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal data to third parties at any time. What this means is if you notify Us of your request, We will respect your wishes not to sell your personal data.
Right not to be discriminated for exercising these rights. You have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising your privacy rights. This means that We won’t deny you goods or services, charge different amounts or provide a different quality level of goods or services for exercising your rights unless the difference is reasonably related to the value of your data.
