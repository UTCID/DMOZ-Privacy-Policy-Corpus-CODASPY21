Opt-out of sale: you can ask us to stop certain transfers of your personal information to our third party service providers. We do not sell your PI to third parties in the traditional sense as we do not receive money in exchange for sharing your PI, however, as mentioned above, we do share your PI as follows which may be considered a "sale" under the CCPA. If you do not want us to share your information with third parties for marketing related communications, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in such communication.

We need to verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
