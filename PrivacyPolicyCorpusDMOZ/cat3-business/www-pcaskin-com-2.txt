Such advertisements are served based on your access to and use of our Services and other websites or online services on any of your devices, as well as on data received from third parties. Third-party advertising companies make this possible by placing or recognizing a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags).

JURISDICTION AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER

Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here).

THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE
We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment through the Services, your Personal Data will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
