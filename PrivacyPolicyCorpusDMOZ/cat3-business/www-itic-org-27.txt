Eco Friendly Materials
Go Back
The tech sector has a proven history of leading by example when selecting the materials that go into our products. Certain materials have unique properties that provide the functionality and reliability that consumers demand. The industry strives to produce products that are faster, perform better, and are lighter and more efficient while simultaneously reducing the overall environmental impact of the product over its complete lifecycle. When possible, we also work to identify substitute materials that may be better for the environment and that maintain the high performance our customers demand. For example, choosing a material that will allow a smartphone to survive a drop, while ensuring the material meets the high sustainability goals of the industry, is not an easy task.
ITI works on behalf of our members to promote science-based regulations that are consistent across jurisdictions. This is particularly important for global tech companies, as it provides the consistency that allows our companies to design products for global sale.
