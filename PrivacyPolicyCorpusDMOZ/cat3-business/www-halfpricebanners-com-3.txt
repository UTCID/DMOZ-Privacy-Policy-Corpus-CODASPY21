Return Policy
The Company guarantees that all products will arrive as described on Our Website, will print as shown in your proofs (other than slight color variations), and will be free of manufacturing defects.
If you have any questions regarding our Return Policy please contact Customer Service at (866) 527-1363.
All of our vinyl and large format banners are warrantied for ninety (90) days of use from the date of delivery if installed correctly. If your banner fails within ninety (90) days of delivery, the defect must be reported within nine (9) calendar days of the failure along with a detailed description and clear photos of the failed display as it was installed. By ordering, you agree that the Company holds sole discretion in determining whether the failure of a product is the result of a manufacturing defect. You also agree to provide the Company with any and all information necessary to determine the circumstances of the product's failure.
Since all items ordered from Half Price Banners are custom-printed just for you, we can only accept return requests if your items are produced incorrectly or arrive broken, defective, or damaged from transit.
If you are not satisfied with your order for any reason, please contact support@halfpricebanners.com within nine (9) calendar days of delivery and provide the following:
Your Order Number
Which items from your order are damaged/incorrect
Clear digital photos of all damaged/incorrect items, the shipping package, and the packing material
We will review and respond to your return request within two (2) business days. If we determine that a product has a manufacturing error, we will quickly reprint and ship your product, provide a Half Price Banners store credit equal to the purchase price of the damaged items, or issue a full refund of the purchase price of defective/broken product(s). Please keep all damaged items and packaging materials for at least two weeks in case the item must be shipped back to our location for inspection.
Warranty and return policy will not apply under the following circumstances:
Errors – We are not responsible for errors such as, but not limited to, misspelling/typos, incorrect punctuation, grammatical errors, low-resolution/pixelated files, or providing incorrect contact/shipping information (phone number, email address, delivery address, etc.) that you approve in the proofing process. Please review your order information and proofs carefully before approving your order for production. Please review our Terms and Conditions for additional information.
Color Variation – While we are G7 Certified and our printers are calibrated to provide outstanding color quality, there will be some slight differences between the colors as represented on your computer screen and colors of the final print. If you are concerned about color variation, please review our Color Matching policy in our Terms and Conditions.
If you have any additional questions, please call Customer Service at (866) 527-1363.
Improper Use – Proper installation and care of your banner/display is critical to getting the longest life out of your purchase. Text and video instructions to install and care for your display are included in the "Instructions and Care" sections of our Website.
The Company cannot be held liable for improper installation, use, or care of its products, nor can we be liable for damage due to the following, including but not limited to: "Acts of God", extreme weather, excessive heat or cold, wind, rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
Arrival of Time-Sensitive Jobs – If your job is time-sensitive and must arrive by a specific date in order to be used, we recommend reviewing the Turnaround section of our Terms and Conditions prior to placing your order to ensure it is possible for your product to arrive in time for your event.
We recommend allowing enough time for your products to arrive at least 1-2 days before your event. UPS 2nd Day and Next Day Air are available for every product we sell, and rush options are available for most items for an additional fee.
By using Our Website, you agree and acknowledge that we are not responsible for items that arrive after your delivery date unless we have expressly guaranteed a delivery date in writing (via email). If you have a deadline, you may request expedited shipping by calling Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 and expressly state your delivery date in the order comments during checkout.
We will inform you via email of the cutoff time by which you must approve your proofs in order to meet your deadline. Half Price Banners is not responsible for a customers' inability/failure to approve proofs prior to the stated production cutoff time.
If you believe your package is lost, please contact Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 as soon as possible.
Additional details regarding lost packages can be found in the Shipping section of our Terms and Conditions.
Please review our Terms and Conditions regarding this policy.
If you have any additional questions, please call Customer Service at (866) 527-1363.
