Our response to COVID-19 outbreak
March 30, 2020
Dear IVolatility subscriber, we would like to give you an update on IVolatility's response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
We implemented measures to safeguard our team and fully transitioned our workforce to work from home status as of two weeks ago.
We can assure you that we will continue to operate our tools and services providing you and users around the world with crucial market volatility updates. Due to abnormal activity in the market, there is a strong technical overload on all data transmission channels, and we constantly monitor data services and adjust and split the data stream to process data without delays or interruptions. Further, our support and sales team are available as usual, and we are looking forward to hearing how we can help you!
We want you to feel informed and confident when working with us. We have several initiatives we're deploying to help our clients in this complicated time, including free subscriptions to our live market tracker, discounts on data, and more that will be announced very soon. We understand these are volatile times, but together we'll get through it stronger than before.
Take care of yourself and your family, safeguard your safety and wellbeing, and remember to wash your hands frequently.
We appreciate your loyalty, and we look forward to serving you with the most accurate, consistent, and up-to-date volatility data available, since for options, we are Big Data!
Thanks,
IVolatility team
