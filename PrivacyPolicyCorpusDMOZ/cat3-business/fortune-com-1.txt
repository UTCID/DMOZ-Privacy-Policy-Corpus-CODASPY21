Subscriber's Automatic Renewal Program: Enjoy your first term of issues for the rate shown at time of order (which may be a free trial).
After such period, we will automatically renew your subscription for a new term as described at the time you accepted the offer, charged to the payment mechanism you authorized at the time of your offer acceptance (which may be a credit or debit card, or third party payment device such as Paypal) until you tell us to stop. If your credit card expires or your payment method is otherwise invalid, your subscription or product will not automatically be terminated. You will remain responsible for all charges. For annual renewal periods: each year we will send you a reminder notice with the rate for the next term and instructions on how to cancel which you may do at any time by contacting customer service or logging into your account. If you cancel mid-term, you will receive a refund on all undelivered issues. For monthly renewal periods, if you cancel, you may continue to receive access to your subscription until the end of that paid period and you will not be charged for future terms.
No refunds are issued for monthly subscription plans. We reserve the right to change prices and fees at any time. We will notify you in advance if the regular rate of a product changes from what was stated at the time of your order. You will have the opportunity to accept the new price or cancel your subscription or purchase from that point forward. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your subscription or product for any reason, with or without notice and without further obligation.
For all subscriptions, if we are not able to charge your authorized payment mechanism for your renewal, we may attempt to charge you again before the end of your current billing term, update your account information using information obtained from third parties, such as your credit card company, or if such efforts are not successful, we may bill you directly using your contact and account information.
You agree to keep all of your contact and account information current and accurate and notify us immediately if such information changes at any time. You authorize us to maintain your billing account information to charge your account as described above until you cancel. Fortune magazine is only available to subscribers with a U.S. or Canadian postal address. Subscriptions may be available in other jurisdictions but either may not be auto-renewed or have access to digital editions. The magazine currently publishes 2 double issues. Each counts as two of 14 issues in an annual subscription. Your first issue mails in 6-8 weeks. We reserve the right to modify the content, type and availability of the Web Site or any product or Web Site Services at any time. Applicable sales tax will be added.
