collect and retain certain types of information whenever you interact with
Juju’s website and services, which includes data provided by your
browser or email program, such as your IP address, Juju cookies, http
referer, and the pages you request. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers
that your Web browser stores on your computer's hard drive when you access
Juju’s website and services. Juju uses cookies to enable our systems to
recognize your browser and record how and when our website and services
are utilized. Most Web browsers allow users to receive notification when
new cookies are set, specify which cookies to accept and reject, or
disable cookies entirely (consult your browser’s “Help” menu for
guidance on adjusting your settings). We recommend that you accept all
cookies from Juju because turning them off may prevent or impair your
access to our website and services. Some of Juju’s business partners and
advertisers may transfer cookies to your browser when you use our website
and services. We do not control or have access to these cookies.
Affiliated Sites
Juju offers some of our services in connection with other websites.
Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to us in
order to deliver our services to you. We collect, retain and process such
information from affiliated sites in accordance with this Policy.
Affiliated sites may have different privacy practices than Juju and we
encourage you to read their privacy policies.
Children
You must be at least 13 years of age to register to use the Juju
website. Juju is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Juju
does not knowingly collect personal information about children under the
age of 13. If we learn that Juju has received information from a child
under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as
possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 ask and
receive their parents' permission before using Juju or sending information
about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
Use of Your Personal Information
Juju uses your personal information as described below:
Juju uses the personal information that we collect to provide you with our
products and services, including the display of customized content and
advertising. That includes use for auditing, research and analysis for the
purposes of maintaining, protecting and improving our services; developing new
services; and ensuring the proper functioning of our systems and
infrastructure.
We may combine the information you submit under your Juju account with
information from other Juju services or third parties in order to provide you
with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.
Juju processes personal information on our servers in the United States of
America. In some cases, that may mean that we process personal information on
a server outside your own country.
Juju’s employees, consultants, and contractors may have access to your
personal information if necessary in the normal course of our business
operations.
Juju may provide your personal information to third parties that we have
contracted with to help us deliver services or process data (such as email
delivery or transaction processing). In these cases, we only disclose
information to the extent we deem necessary to achieve the purpose at hand and
use service providers that have provided assurances about the security and
confidentiality of the data that we share.
Juju may share certain aggregated, non-personal information with third
parties for marketing and other purposes, such as the number of visitors to
our website, the search terms that those visitors used, or the number of times
users clicked a particular advertisement. Such aggregated, non-personal
information does not identify you individually.
If Juju, or any portion of its assets, is acquired by a third party, the
information we have collected and stored may be among the assets transferred
to the acquiring party.
We may release personal information if we believe that doing so is
necessary to comply with a law, court order or subpoena; enforce or apply our
Terms of Use or other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety
of Juju, our employees, our users, or others.
Juju has implemented procedural and technological measures intended to
secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, Juju cannot guarantee
that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat those measures or use
your personal information improperly. You are responsible for the security
of your Juju username and password. We strongly recommend that you never
share your Juju login information with others and that you protect
yourself against unauthorized access to your account by logging off once
you have finished using any computer that is accessible to others. For
your convenience, Juju allows you to manage your email alert settings and
preferences (such as search keywords and location) via links included in
emails that we send to your inbox, and do not require a username or
password to view alert information or change settings. If you share a Juju
email alert, the recipient will be able to access your alert settings and
preferences.
Email Communications
Juju respects your email preferences and will never provide your email
address to a third party without your permission, except under the limited
circumstances described in the "Use of Your Personal Information" section
above. If you provide us your email address, Juju may email you job
alerts, account notifications, news, offers, surveys or promotions, and
other communications. If you do not want to receive particular types of
email from Juju, follow the instructions contained in any unwanted email
messages to notify us of your preferences. However, please note that you
may continue to receive administrative emails (such as responses to
forgotten password requests) and legal notices from us as long as you
remain a registered user or utilize our website or services.
How to Control Your Information
You can choose not to disclose information to Juju, although doing so may
limit or impair your access to our website and services.
You can modify your email preferences to restrict or eliminate email from
Juju, subject to the limitations related to administrative emails and legal
notices described in the Email Communications section above.
You can control how your browser handles cookies from Juju, although
disabling cookies from Juju may limit or impair your access to our website and
services.
You can update your information at any time on our website. However, note
that when you do so we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our
records.
You can request deletion of your Juju account by contacting us.
Protect Yourself from Scams
Juju uses automated processes to collect and present information that
has been created by third parties, so we cannot assure the accuracy or
legitimacy of that information. We strongly recommend that you exercise
caution when providing information about yourself to others online,
including when you apply for jobs found via Juju. To protect yourself, we
suggest the following:
Never provide your social security number, credit card
information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information
to a potential employer.
Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a
potential employer.
Always be cautious of opportunities that sound too good to be true
or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an
overseas person.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Juju may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole
discretion. Use of information we collect from time to time is subject to
the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we
make changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notification by
posting an announcement on the Juju website so you can monitor the types
of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if
any, it is disclosed. It is your responsibility to review our current
Privacy Policy to ensure your continued agreement with its terms. If at
any point you disagree with any of the terms of our Privacy Policy, you
should request deletion of your Juju account by contacting us.
Conditions of Use
If you decide to use Juju’s website or services, your use and any
possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our
Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes,
and application of Delaware law, without applying any conflict of laws
principle that would result in the application of the law of any other
state.
Effective Date

updated March 12, 2013.
