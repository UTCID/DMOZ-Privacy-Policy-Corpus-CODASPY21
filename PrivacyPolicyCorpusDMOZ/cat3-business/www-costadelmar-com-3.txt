TO OUR CREW
SEE DELIVERY UPDATES >
ONE CREW. ONE BOAT. ONE PASSION.
Since 1983, we’ve been committed to developing the best sunglasses on the planet to help you and all our Costa crew SEE WHAT’S OUT THERE. We’ve come a long way since then, but the fact is, our passion hasn’t changed at all. We’re still happiest when the sun is up, and we’re out exploring on the water. We’re still obsessed with making the best sunglasses in this vast, ever changing watery world. And we still believe we have a responsibility to help protect what we can while we’re out there.
We’re all in the same boat. Know that we’re doing all we can at this sensitive time to protect our whole crew, and that means we’ll likely have some shipping delays during this challenging time for us all. We’ll get your gear to you as soon as we can, so you can get back out there as soon as you can.
