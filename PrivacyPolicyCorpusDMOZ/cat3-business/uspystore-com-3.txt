Shipping Policy
Shipping Policy
Coverage: We ship to all US States as well as most international locations. Please note that orders placed to PO Boxes or international addresses will be shipped using USPS Priority Mail.
Timing: Orders placed after 3:00 p.m. Central Time will be shipped the following business day. Orders placed over the weekend will ship the following Monday (unless it is a Holiday). UPS Ground from Chicago will usually arrive in 3~5 business days, but this time frame is not guaranteed. Expedited options guaranteed by UPS to arrive within 1-3 business days are available for an extra charge and can be selected at checkout. Please note that UPS by default does not deliver on weekends or holidays. For expedited shipping guarantee times please visit the UPS website.
Freight / Charges: All orders over $75 shipped to a destination within the continental United States (48 States) are shipped by UPS Ground free of charge. Shipping charges apply to all other orders shipped to Hawaii, Alaska and outside the USA (as well as expedited shipping methods if desired). The charges are automatically calculated by UPS and may be determined through the shipping calculator on our website once details of the products and the ship to location are provided as well as the manner of shipping chosen. Shipping charges for returned orders are the sole responsibility of the customer. It is your responsibility to use a safe method of returning your purchase for whatever reason. Freight is non refundable.
Discretion: Most purchases from the U-Spy Store are shipped in unmarked packaging under the name USI Enterprises. A signature may be required upon delivery for orders totaling more than $150. Packages may be held at local UPS facilities for pickup if requested when placing your order.
Restrictions: As regulated by the Department of Transportation, pepper spray, aerosol products and other items considered to be hazardous materials cannot be shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, US territories (i.e. Guam, Puerto Rico) or outside the USA. Our policy is to ship these items via UPS Ground service. These items will be shipped separately from the balance of your order. Some products may not be exported by law or may be illegal in your state. It is your responsibility to investigate and have knowledge of all state laws, laws in your country, duty charges and any other restrictions concerning a product. Please check your laws concerning pepper spray, lock picks, self defense products and all other products before ordering.
Verification: No matter what shipping method is chosen, to protect our customers from online credit card fraud, we may hold up an order for further verification if it is being shipped to an address different from the billing address. If the addresses are different for your order, please contact your credit card company to add the alternate shipping address as an authorized secondary address. Your credit card company's phone number can be found on the back of your credit card. We may decline shipments to unverified shipping addresses as per instructions of the credit card company. This is for your protection and to help maintain a safe on-line shopping experience.
Order Status: Orders marked "Shipped" but does not include a tracking number may have an item (or items) that are located at our supplier's warehouse and are being shipped directly to the customer to ensure prompt delivery. Tracking information may not be initially available but will be updated as soon as possible.
