PRIVACY
Please review our Privacy Policy, which governs the use of personal information on the Site and to which you agree and consent to be bound if you use the Site.
POSTED CONTENT
As part of your use of the Site, you may upload, post, distribute or disseminate (collectively, "post") samples of your work, images, videos, animation, files, data, information and other content and material (the "Posted Content") on the Site. You hereby grant SSC an irrevocable, nonexclusive, transferable royalty-free worldwide right (including any moral rights) and license to use the Posted Content for purposes of promotion within The Site. In connection with the operation and promotion of the Site, you agree that SS has the right to copy, cache, modify, publish, display, distribute, translate, create derivative works from, and store the Posted Content, regardless of the medium, technology, or form in which it is used. For example, SSC may use the Posted Content to promote your material, on your behalf, and may indirectly include the content during the course of Site demonstrations. SSC does not claim the right to use your images in any way other than on the Site itself, and is not responsible for any unauthorized third-party image usage that may occur.
You also warrant that if you are not the holder of any such rights, the holder of such rights has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted you the right to grant the license stated above. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the form, content and accuracy of any Posted Content. You agree that you will not post any false, inaccurate or incomplete material or delete or revise any material that was not posted by you. You are responsible for your own postings and are responsible for the consequences of your postings. You agree not to do any of the following: (a) post any material that is copyrighted or trademarked unless you own the copyright or trademark or have the owner's permission (including requisite consents and releases) to post it; (b) post any material that reveals a trade secret, unless you own the trade secret or have the owner's permission to post it; (c) post any material that infringes on any intellectual property right of another or on the privacy or publicity rights of another; (d) post any material that is unlawful, obscene, pornographic, sexual, indecent, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful or embarrassing to another user or to any other person or entity; (e) post any chain letter or pyramid scheme; or (f) post any material that contains a virus, trojan horse, worm, time bomb or other computer programming routine or engine that is intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or information.
SSC allows Members to update Posted Content on their member pages at any time; provided that such Posted Content be new. You agree not to misuse the "update" button simply to appear on the SPORTSSHOOTER.COM homepage. SSC may deactivate a Member's page, delete the page from the Site without refunding the membership fee, or take any other actions it deems appropriate under these Terms and Conditions if a Member misuses the update function.
Members are permitted to post messages to the SSC message board, and use the features and functions it contains. However, SSC may deactivate a Member's page, delete the page from the Site without refunding the membership fee, or take any other actions it deems appropriate under these Terms and Conditions if a Member misuses the message board. "Misuse" of the message board includes (but is not limited to): the posting of
any type of commercial announcement or advertisement; the posting of press releases or copyrighted materials copied-and-pasted from other places; use of the 'Instant Feedback' tool with the intent to harm another member's reputation (in which case, SSC will have full and complete authority to use collected data to determine if such intent exists.)
SSC does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy or reliability of any Posted Content or endorse any opinions expressed by a user. You acknowledge that any reliance on Posted Content by other users will be at your own risk. SSC does not confirm that each user is who he or she claims to be. SSC exercises a great effort to protect Posted Content from being misused. However, if misuse has occurred SSC is no way liable for such misuse. Because SSC is not involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of participants on the Site, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release SSC (and its members, agents and employees) from any claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential, direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute. SSC acts as a passive conduit for Posted Content and has no obligation to screen or monitor Posted Content. If SSC becomes aware of any Posted Content that allegedly may not conform to these Terms and Conditions, SSC may investigate the allegation and determine in its sole discretion whether to take action in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. SSC has no liability or responsibility to Users for performance or nonperformance of such activities. You may find some Posted Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, mislabeled or deceptively labeled. SSC expects that you will use caution and common sense when using the Site.
SSC HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO REMOVE AND/OR DELETE WITHOUT NOTICE ANY POSTED CONTENT THAT IT DEEMS OBJECTIONABLE. YOU CONSENT TO SUCH REMOVAL AND/OR DELETION AND WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST SSC FOR SUCH REMOVAL AND/OR DELETION.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE A FIXED UPPER LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE SPACE THAT YOU MAY USE TO POST CONTENT AND THAT SSC MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPRESS OR PERFORM OTHER TECHNICAL PROCESSING OF YOUR POSTED CONTENT.
SSC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO STORE POSTED CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS YOU TRANSMIT THROUGH THIS SITE. YOU SHOULD TAKE MEASURES TO PRESERVE COPIES OF ANY DATA, MATERIAL, CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST ON THE SITE.
MEMBERSHIP/BILLING
If you are at least eighteen (18) years of age, you have the option of becoming a Member of SPORTSSHOOTER.COM (a "Member") and enjoy the benefits of membership described on the Site at the time you sign up. If you become a Member, you hereby agree to pay the annual membership fee, including applicable taxes, in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable, and abide by the Terms and Conditions like any other user. We reserve the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for services we provide, and to institute new fees, charges, or terms effective upon prior notice to Members. We reserve the right to terminate any account at any time for any reason.
SSC agrees that it will terminate Member's account upon notice from Member. If cancellation is received within the first ten (10) days of Member's signing up, Member will be refunded all membership fees, but Member will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If Member cancels membership after ten (ten) days of signing up, no refund will be made. If Member has a balance due on its account, Member agrees that SSC can charge these unpaid fees to Member's credit card.
Please Note: Your Membership will be automatically renewed and you will be automatically charged as follows:
Upon every one (1) year anniversary
The renewal charge shall be equal to the original annual membership fee, unless otherwise notified in advance by SSC. Member will have thirty (30) days after the date that any renewal fee is charged to Member's account to give notice that Member wishes to cancel the membership. The membership will be cancelled upon receipt of such notification and a credit will be given to the Member equal to the latest renewal fee charged.
Member's right to use the site is subject to any limits established by SSC. If payment cannot be processed or is returned for any reason, including insufficient funds, SSC reserves the right to either suspend or terminate Member's access and account, thereby terminating this Agreement and all obligations of SSC hereunder.
If Member has reason to believe that Member's account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of Member's ID, password, or any credit, debit or charge card number stored) notify SSC of the problem to avoid possible liability for any unauthorized charges to Member's account.
SPORTSSHOOTER.COM membership does not entitle you to a subscription to the Sports Shooter newsletter or to publication within the Sports Shooter newsletter, nor does it permit you to conduct 'official' events under the SportsShooter.com or "Sports Shooter" names. Membership to SPORTSSHOOTER.COM does not give you permission to send unsolicited commercial email (SPAM) to other members, and doing so is cause for immediate termination of your membership.

SSC acts as a facilitator and on-line venue only for the listing of an item by the seller and introducing sellers to buyers. SSC is not a party to any contract for sale of any item. The sale of an item is a matter between the seller and the buyer alone and makes SSC no warranty regarding any item purchased or obtained through this service. All sellers offering an item for sale must be legally entitled to sell the item and the item must be accurately described.
