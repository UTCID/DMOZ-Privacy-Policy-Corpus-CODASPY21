Synthetic hedges
TENAX synthetic hedges have multiple uses: an original screen for balconies; to renovate an old gate or to temporarily cover a fence while flowers or plants are growing. They perfectly imitate the natural product and are light and versatile: they are ideal to quickly and inexpensively decorate any corner where real greenery is not possible due to lack of soil or water.
