DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
We use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.

If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
