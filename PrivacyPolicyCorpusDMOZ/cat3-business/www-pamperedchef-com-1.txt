Pampered Chef reserves the right to change the Pampered Chef subscription benefit(s), including discount shipping and eligibility of benefits, at any time in its sole discretion. All changes will not apply to orders already processed, but shall apply to future orders, including current subscriptions. By purchasing a Pampered Chef subscription, you grant Pampered Chef the right to use the information provided by you to process your purchase, in order to create a user profile for you on our website(s): pamperedchef.com or Consultant’s Corner.   Some of the offer details may change as you receive deliveries over time (e.g. price, taxes, and shipping charges). New Season Product Sample: Consultants can purchase one New Season Product Sample, which contains one box of Pea Protein and one box of Kale & Fiber, which has a promotion of 50% off for your first purchase of the New Season Product Sample. (The discounted EnrichablesTM package at $49 is not available as a 50% off new season sample.) Kit Enhancement: Consultants can purchase one Kit Enhancement, which contains one box of Pea Protein and one box of Kale & Fiber at 40% off for your first purchase of the Kit Enhancement. (The discounted EnrichablesTM package at $49 is not available as a 40% kit enhancement item.) One-time Purchase: You can order Enrichables™ as a one-time purchase at your normal personal discount of 20-40%. Bulk Order: There is a limit of one bulk package of EnrichablesTM per supply order, starting mid-October, 2019. If the product is unavailable when Pampered Chef plans to ship it, you authorize Pampered Chef to fulfill your order within a reasonable time. Your subscription will automatically create a new order according to your chosen delivery schedule, until you cancel.   If you register for a Pampered Chef subscription plan, you will be charged for the initial amount at checkout (less the Pampered Chef subscription discount(s) and any applicable sales tax) followed by recurring charges as agreed to by you, unless you notify Pampered Chef at least seven (7) days before the next recurring order is processed, that you want to cancel the Pampered Chef subscription. Until you provide the required advance notice that you wish to cancel this authorization, Pampered Chef may charge and collect the applicable amount, without further authorization from you, using the payment method we have on record for you.   The charge for each Pampered Chef subscription will be billed to the payment method used to create your subscription or as otherwise directed by the customer. You hereby consent to Pampered Chef processing and charging the form of payment on file for each reoccurring subscription order. If Pampered Chef is unable to process and complete your Pampered Chef subscription order with your selected payment method used to purchase your subscription, you authorize Pampered Chef to deny the processing of the order(s) and contact you for a proper form of payment.     Pampered Chef may, in its sole discretion, terminate your subscription(s) at any time without notice. If Pampered Chef does so, you will be charged for order(s) that have been shipped to you. Your Pampered Chef subscription(s) will remain in effect until it is cancelled. You can cancel at any time via your Manage Subscription page located on your profile (Customers: pamperedchef.com; or Consultants: Consultants Corner); by emailing Pampered Chef: solution_center@pamperedchef.com; or by calling our Solution Center at: 1 (888) 687-2433. Once you have cancelled your subscription(s), Pampered Chef will process your request within the next five (5) business days. If you cancel your subscription and then reactivate the account, the discount(s) applied to any Pampered Chef subscription product may not be the same discount(s) in effect at the time of cancellation. If there is a new Pampered Chef subscription discount, which is active at the time of reactivating your Pampered Chef subscription, the new Pampered Chef subscription discount(s) may be applied to your Pampered Chef subscription orders placed after reactivating your Pampered Chef subscription account. If you initially purchased a sample EnrichablesTM subscription, which includes a box of each EnrichablesTM product, but only wish to continue the subscription of one of the EnrichablesTM products, this will require you to cancel the entire sample EnrichablesTM subscription, and purchase a new EnrichablesTM subscription for the single EnrichablesTM product.   Pampered Chef subscription benefit(s), such as free shipping, are limited to Pampered Chef subscription purchases only, and are not applied to products outside the Pampered Chef subscription order(s). If an order contains other Pampered Chef products, beyond a Pampered Chef subscription, the Pampered Chef subscription benefit(s) will only apply to Pampered Chef subscription product(s) in that order. The total retail value of a Pampered Chef subscription order, if coupled with other items in your check out cart, will not affect the total retail price that is considered when determining which shipping price bracket is assigned to your purchase. Free shipping on a Pampered Chef subscription order only applies to standard shipping method(s), and does not apply to rushed, expedited, overnight, or any other non-standard shipping methods. Pampered Chef subscription benefit(s) are only available for orders shipping to addresses in the United States and Canada (excluding providence of Quebec).   The Pampered Chef subscription benefit(s) are personal to you, and you may not assign or transfer your subscription or any of the benefit(s) to any third party without Pampered Chef’s prior written authorization.
