We may disclose your personal information also to third parties that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or warranty claim, offering customer service, sending our communications, and administering testimonials and contests and administering our vendor and service provider programs. These third parties are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us pursuant to written instructions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements, and are not allowed to use PI they receive from us for any other purpose. Except as otherwise provided herein, we will not share your personal information with any other third-party organizations not acting as our service providers except with your express consent.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required to by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal processes, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or response to a government request.
If Otter is involved in a merger, acquisition, dissolution, sale of all or a portion of its assets, or other fundamental corporate transaction, we reserve the right to sell or transfer your information as part of the transaction. In such an event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership, incompatible new uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Log Files, Cookies, and Other Tracking Technologies
This Website utilizes industry standard analytics packages that automatically gathers limited information on Website users, and stores this information in server log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, referring pages, operating system used, and date/time stamps. This information is used only for Website administration, as well as for analysis of Website usage and trends.
Otter collects user traffic usage characteristics throughout its Website. However, we do not correlate this data with individual user information. Otter may analyze usage statistics according to a user’s domain name, browser type, and Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type by reading this information from data contained in the user’s browser.
Otter may collect and catalog search terms in its search function that users employ, but such collection and cataloging are not associated with individual users. We may use search terms to determine the areas of this Website most important to users, based on the characteristics of usage or traffic of those areas. We will not use these search terms to track what any particular individual users read, but rather the performance of each page. This may help us to build a better web-based experience for you.
Otter and its affiliates and service providers (e.g., marketing providers, analytics providers, and/or payment processors) utilize technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts. Otter uses these technologies in analyzing trends, administering this Website, tracking users’ movements around this Website, and gathering demographic information about our Website users. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these third parties on an individual as well as an aggregated basis.
We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g., language preference), to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience of using this Website, and to authenticate users. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use this Website, but your ability to use some features or areas of this Website, such as our blogs, polls, and surveys, may be limited.
We utilize a third-party service provider to understand better our Website users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. This technology helps us to understand better our users’ experience and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. This third-party service provider uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on your behavior and your devices (in particular device’s IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and preferred language used to display our website). This third-party service provider stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither the third-party service provider nor we will use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. You can opt-out to the third-party service provider’s storing of data about your usage of our Website and third-party service provider use of tracking cookies on other websites by enabling the Do Not Track header in your browser.
We utilize a third-party service provider to manage our advertising on other Websites. This service provider may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Website and other sites, in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish not to have this information used for serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union by clicking here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
We use "local storage", such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties that provide certain features on this Website (e.g., YouTube) also use local storage, and HTML5, to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
Your Rights and Choices around your Data
You may request to update, correct, access, or delete your personal information, or to know whether we hold any of your personal information. You may request restrictions, temporarily or permanently, on our processing of some or all personal information about you. To request a copy of the personal data we have collected about you, or to request that your information be deleted, or to submit any other privacy request, please contact us by clicking here: Privacy Request Form.
You also may make your request by telephone or by postal mail at the address/phone number indicated in the contact information below.
We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
California residents may have additional personal information rights and choices. Please see Your California Privacy Rights for more information.
Nevada residents who wish to exercise their sale opt-out rights under Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A may submit a request by clicking here: Privacy Request Form. However, please know we do not currently sell data triggering that statute’s opt-out requirements.
Protection of Personal Information
We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction or damage. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage can ever be fully secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
Nevertheless, the security of your personal information is extremely important to us. For instance, we employ various firewalls and other security tactics to keep your information secure. We do not store your complete credit card information on our internal web server. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using transport layer security (TLS) technology. While there is risk inherent in every Internet transaction, be assured that we are work hard to ensure that risk is minimal. If you have questions about the security of your personal information, or if you have reason to believe that the personal information that we hold about you is no longer secure, please contact us immediately as described in this Policy.
Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. To learn more about your California privacy rights, visit https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/california-privacy.html.
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
Otter participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Otter is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and the United Kingdom and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list]
Otter is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Otter complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Otter is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Otter may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
