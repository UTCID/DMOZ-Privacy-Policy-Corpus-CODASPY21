When visiting our Websites you have the option to provide us with Personal Data relating to you. Additionally, when you use our Services we automatically collect certain information about you and your internet usage. The specific categories of Personal Data concerned and the sources from which we obtain them are linked to the way you interact with our Websites and Services. More information about the categories of Personal Data and the ways in which we collect it are described below.
(1) Personal Data You Give to Us. Our Websites offer you the possibility of (i) contacting us via an online request form; (ii) signing up to receive email alerts; and (iii) registering for a Customer Information System (“CIS”), Graco Partner Portal ("Partner Portal"), or a Graco External Distributor Interface (“GEDI”) account.

Our Websites use single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent) cookies. Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open, and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation on our Websites.

(4) Social Media Plugins. When using our Websites we allow you to share information with social media sites and to access our social media profiles through so-called plugins. Social networks are able to retrieve Personal Data through those plugins, even if you don’t interact with them. Moreover, if you are logged onto a social network while visiting our Websites with social plugins imbedded in them, the network can collect and store information about such visit and link it to your social network user account. As we have no control over the data collected by social media networks through their plugins, we encourage you to read their applicable data privacy policies to learn more about them.
Once you choose to share information from our Websites on social media or when you connect with our social media profiles through the plugins, those social media sites allow us to automatically access Personal Data retained by them about you consisting of content viewed by you, content liked by you and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on. You can restrict our access to your Personal Data by changing your privacy setting on the respective social media site.
Lastly, you can access our Websites via a third-party service, e.g. from our profiles on social networks. In those cases, we collect Personal Data from your social media user account consisting of your first and last name, email address and phone number and any other information you have made public.
We will only process your Personal Data for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. We will not process your Personal Data for any further purposes than the ones the data was originally intended for, unless the new purpose is compatible with the original one. In the absence of compatibility, the processing of data for further purposes is subject to your prior explicit consent.
We process the Personal Data you provide us with for the purposes listed below:
If you are a Graco distributor:
Evaluate your eligibility for a CIS, Partner Portal, or GEDI account and manage your account;
Communicate with you upon a request for information, support or customer service; and
Inform you about our products and services, events, newsflashes, newsletters, surveys, purchases of services and/or products.
If you are a general user:
Inform you about our products and services, events, newsflashes, newsletters, surveys, purchases of services and/or products;
Communicate with you upon a request to offer information, product support or for the purpose of customer service;
Log the Graco products you have purchased, if applicable (via Product Registration Form submitted by you); and
Send you email alerts to inform you about publications on your investors’ domain.
The Personal Data we collect automatically is statistical data that helps us improve our Websites’ features and functionalities in order to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:
Determine website traffic patterns;
Count web visits;
Determine traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site;
Observe site search patterns to provide more intuitive navigation cues;
Determine user frequency and time between user visits; and
Prevent and detect misuse and malfunction of our Websites including troubleshooting.
The processing of all the Personal Data we collect relating to you is either based (i) on your consent; (ii) necessary to provide you with our products and services at your request prior to entering into a contract with you or necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party; (iii) necessary to comply with a legal obligation; or (iv) based on our legitimate interests in ensuring the functionality of our Websites and Services and that they are tailored to your needs, unless these are overridden by your interests and rights.
Due to the international scope of our business, your Personal Data can be shared or accessed by Graco-affiliated entities within the company group. You can find more information on data transfers to affiliates based outside of the EU in Section VI. below.
Subject to applicable law and regulations, we share your Personal Data with:
Public authorities, including law enforcement;
Graco distributors;
Service providers acting on our behalf for the purposes listed above in Section IV. We require these service providers to only process Personal Data in accordance with our instructions and only as long as necessary to perform the requested services or in compliance with applicable law (e.g., invitation mailing and newsletter distribution providers, website and app administration providers); and
In connection with a merger, joint venture, sale or transfer of all or a portion of our assets or stock, or other similar corporate transactions involving a change of ownership or control.
International data transfers refer to transfers of Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We are a company with operations around the world. Accordingly, our business requires the transfer of Personal Data to and from other group companies or third parties, which may be located outside the EEA, including the United States of America. A list of our worldwide Graco-branded group companies can be obtained here. Our non-Graco-branded subsidiaries include White Knight Fluid Handling, QED Environmental Systems Handling, Graco Fluid Handling (I) Inc. doing business as Imtec Aculine Inc., Graco Fluid Handling (H) Inc. doing business as Heateflex Corporation, HiP, and Gema Powder Coating and its subsidiary SAT S.p.A. We will only transfer Personal Data to countries that provide for an adequate data protection standard meeting the requirements as set out by the European Commission. Data transfers to countries not meeting that threshold will only occur in accordance with international data transfer agreements based on EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
If you are a resident of a country in the EEA or the UK, the European Commission (“EC”) recognizes some non-EEA countries as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards. For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the EC, as well as for transfers from the UK to countries not considered adequate by a competent authority with jurisdiction over such transfers, we have put in place measures deemed adequate the EC, such as the EC’s standard contractual clauses, to protect your personal information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us at privacy@graco.com.
Graco commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EEA and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our policy should first contact privacy@graco.com, calling either +1 612 379 3654 (US) or +32 (0) 89 770 860 (EU), or mailing
Graco Inc.
Attn: Legal-Privacy

USA
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.
Graco is a company with operations around the world. Accordingly, personal information received by Graco may be used globally in connection with employment or business operations within Graco. Personal information may be transferred between Graco entities located in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. Personal information may also be transferred to third parties acting as agents and performing tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of Graco. Graco will transfer personal information received from the EU or Switzerland to a third party agent only if Graco first ascertains that the third party agent subscribes to the Principles, is subject to the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection or another adequacy finding, or agrees in writing to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles.
As a general rule, we will not retain your Personal Data for longer than is allowed under the applicable data protection laws or for longer than is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected or otherwise processed. In the event of inactivity of your CIS, Partner Portal, or GEDI account for the duration of a period of 2 years we will delete your Personal Data, unless statutory retention periods apply.
In the absence of statutory retention periods, alternatively after completion of those periods, we will erase your Personal Data.
