SPEAKING & SEMINAR TOPICS:
SEX, LIES & CELLPHONES:
Becoming Self-Aware & "Other" Wise
Relationships often show many symptoms before breaking out into something really uncomfortable, nasty or hard to recover from.  Dr. Shaler, The Relationship Help Doctor, offers you some "must have" prescriptions you may never have considered for creating the engaging, satisfying and long-term relationship you want, with the one you love, the one you're looking for, or the one you're working with.
Everyone wants emotional intimacy. Most don’t know how to create it. Many are afraid of it. You need to know the secrets.   Get insights you need to have the emotional intimacy you want.
WHEN YOU'D RATHER RUN:
Rules of Engagement for Difficult Conversations
Difficult conversations are minefields. You are fearful of stepping in the wrong place and creating an explosion that could be potentially damaging.
The most secure path is to walk in the footsteps of experts and arrive safely. The insights Dr. Shaler, The Relationship Help Doctor, shares will equip you with a detailed map, practical skills, and essential provisions to navigate and manage the minefields of conflict and communication you may have before you. She'll also give you special strategies for working and living with those you perceive as "difficult".

In this session, Dr. Shaler will help you create the clarity you need to have the relationships you want--mutually respectful, mature and peaceful.
COMMITTING PRE-MEDITATED PEACE:
How to Escape the Drama of Friction & Frenzy
Life would be so much easier without those other people, right? We live in a fast-paced, demanding world. Knowing how reduce the friction and frenzy is imperative. Be wise. Learn the skills and strategies that allow you to feel confident in your communication, boundary-setting, and conflict and anger management. It is empowering--and it works everywhere, at home, work, family and community.
Difficult people--annoying, irrational, picky, sneaky, back-biting, politically-motivated, credit-grabbing, small-minded people--are not difficult to identify. Two things are essential: learn how to respond to them positively, and lean how NOT to be one of them!  Conflicts and confrontations are healthy, necessary parts of life, love and relationships. Don't sidestep them. Get these valuable skills working for you and become part of the solution!
