14. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE; Governing Law
16.1. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. By visiting the Website or otherwise making a purchase from the Website, you and DVF agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted on the Website, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement or any part of it other than disputes qualifying for small claims court and disputes relating to DVF’s intellectual property or licensed intellectual property rights, ("Dispute"), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.
Notice shall be sent:
(1) to DVF in accordance with the Notices provision at Section 15 above, or
(2) to you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your online profile.
Both you and DVF agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party.
IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be exclusively submitted to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect in the New York, New York, USA area, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
16.2 Governing Law. This Agreement and any Dispute will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to any conflict of laws provisions.
17. Choice of Forum.
Any disputes or claims not subject to the arbitration requirement of Section 16 shall be resolved by a court located in New York and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.
18. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.
Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), if you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement on the Website, notification may be sent to DVF’s Designated Agent. To be effective, the notification must be a written communication that includes the following:
1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
We may give notice to any users responsible for content removed or disabled pursuant to a copyright infringement notification by means of a general notice on any of our websites, electronic mail to a user’s e-mail address in our records, or written communication sent by first-class mail to a user’s physical address in our records. If you receive such a notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to the Designated Agent that includes the information below. To be effective, the counter-notification must be a written communication that includes the following:
1. Your physical or electronic signature;
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
3. A statement from you, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
4. Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of a federal district court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.
19. Assignment.
You shall not resell or assign your rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempted assignment or delegation will be void and of no force or effect whatsoever. This Agreement may be automatically assigned by DVF, in our sole discretion, to a third party, and such an assignment will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and/or licensees. Without limiting the foregoing, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your personal information, with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, and a company under our common control, as well as with a potential acquirer, lender, or investor, including in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In each such event, the PII we have collected from you may be one of the assets transferred.
20. No Waiver.
Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to a subsequent or similar breach or breaches. If DVF does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this Agreement (or which DVF has the benefit of under any applicable law or regulation), such action or inaction shall not be taken to be a formal waiver of DVF's rights, and all such rights or remedies shall still be available to DVF.
21. General.
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. Section headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. This Agreement and any ancillary terms and conditions referenced herein or included in the Website sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter hereof. The provisions of this Agreement shall survive suspension or cancellation of your account to the extent necessary to carry out the obligations of you and DVF hereunder.
