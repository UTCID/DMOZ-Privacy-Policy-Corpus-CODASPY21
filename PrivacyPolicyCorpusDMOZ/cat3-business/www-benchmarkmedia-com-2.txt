This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from benchmarkmedia.com (the Site).
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION
Benchmark uses Payment Providers that have secure access to credit card numbers or other methods of payment. Benchmark does not store and cannot view or retrieve credit card numbers, expiration dates, or security codes (these are collected directly by the Payment Providers at the time of checkout). We refer to this information as “Payment Information". Our Payment Providers include Shopify Payments, PayPal, and Amazon Pay. Payment Information is only used to collect the payment for your order and to issue refunds. For your protection, we cannot add additional charges after you place an order.
