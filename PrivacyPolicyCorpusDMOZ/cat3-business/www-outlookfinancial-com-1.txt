Protecting Your Privacy
Protecting the personal information we collect and maintain is as important to us as it is to you.
Like any organization, we require a certain amount of personal information to conduct business and provide you with the products and services you want and need. At the same time, you have a right to know that your privacy is being respected and that your personal information is collected, used and protected appropriately. For that reason, we have policies and practices in place to safeguard and maintain the accuracy and security of your personal information we collect.
Outlook Financial meets or exceeds all privacy standards established by industry guidelines, provincial legislation, the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and all other applicable laws.
