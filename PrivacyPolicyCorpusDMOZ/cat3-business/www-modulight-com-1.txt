© MODULIGHT considers the responsible use of personal information to be a critical element in enabling the Internet to reach its potential as a serious tool for personal and professional activities. As the Internet changes our lives in a number of ways, MODULIGHT is committed to respecting your privacy. In general, you can visit www.modulight.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name, home or business address and e-mail address. MODULIGHT will seek to let you know before we collect any personal information from you over the Internet. Some examples of when we may need information are if you choose to purchase a product directly from MODULIGHT Web sites, subscribe to the Info Messenger notification service, or when you register a new product. When you choose to give us personal information over the Internet that we or our business partners may request, MODULIGHT will endeavor to let you know how we will use this information. MODULIGHT will also seek to take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us.
When MODULIGHT receives information about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you. We will ask you if you want us to use that information to continue contact with you by MODULIGHT and our business partners via e-mail or other means — for example, to send you new product information or notification of special offers. If you do not want us or our partners to contact you, you can choose to “opt out,” and MODULIGHT will endeavor to respect your wishes.
In general on www.modulight.com, IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there.
Some MODULIGHT web pages might use “cookies,” which are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. A cookie helps us remember who you are. It is like when someone frequently visits a certain store — the clerk may not know the customer by name, but recognizes the customer and knows some of that customer’s preferences. Similarly, cookies can make your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.)
