It is the responsibility of the client and end user to ensure that adequate lighting, signage, pedestrian walkways, etc. are in place before the proposed new equipment is installed and operational.
It is emphasised that it is dangerous to permit pedestrians, cyclists or equestrians to pass and travel through the equipment when it is in motion. Therefore, it is recommended that easy alternative routes are provided for non-vehicular traffic and that suitable warning and direction signs are placed on either side of the equipment.
