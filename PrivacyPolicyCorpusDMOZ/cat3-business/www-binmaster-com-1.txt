Privacy Notice and Disclosures for California Residents
This section applies to the data of users who reside in the State of California and supplements information contained in the above Privacy Policy. This information is provided to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA).
The CCPA affords the following rights to consumers:
Access to specific information and data portability rights. You have the right to request BinMaster disclose certain information about our collection and use of your personal information over the last 12 months. This includes:
the categories of information collected about you;the categories of sources for the information collected about you; our business purpose for collecting and, when applicable, sharing that information; the categories of third parties with whom we’ve shared information, if any; the specific pieces of information we collected about you (data portability); if we have shared information, the information categories that each recipient obtained.
Deletion request rights. You have the right to request BinMaster delete personal information collected about you, subject to certain exceptions. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us to:
complete the transaction for which we collected information, provide a good or service you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship, or otherwise perform our contract with you; detect security incidents, protect against malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law; comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.); engage in public or peer-reviewed research in accordance with Section 1798.105 (d)(6) of the CCPA; enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;comply with a legal obligation; or make other internal and lawful uses of information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
To exercise the rights described above or submit questions about BinMaster’s use of your information, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:
Website: https://www.binmaster.com/email-management
Email: privacy@binmaster.com
Phone (toll-free in the U.S.): 800-278-4241
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. Requests for access or data portability may be made no more than twice within a 12-month period. The request must provide enough information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected information and describe your request with enough detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable request within 45 days of receipt. If we require additional time (up to 90 days), we will inform you in writing. Disclosures will only cover the 12-month period preceding the request. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded. If we determine the request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the reason and cost estimate prior to completing the request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. We will not
deny you goods or services; charge a different price for goods or services; provide a different level or quality of goods or services; suggest you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
