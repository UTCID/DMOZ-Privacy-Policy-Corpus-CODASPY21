Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: For certain transactions we work closely with our affiliated businesses to package, ship, and fulfill your order. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. If you choose to opt-in, we may share customer information related to these transactions with such third parties, who may use the information to inform you of their product or service offerings that may be of an interest to you.
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. When you place an order, from time to time we may share your name, email address, mailing address and purchase category information with a few carefully selected marketing partners who may bring you offers of interest. During checkout, you may opt out of receiving marketing information via email.
Protection of MartinLogan and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of MartinLogan, our parent company and its shareholders, or others.
