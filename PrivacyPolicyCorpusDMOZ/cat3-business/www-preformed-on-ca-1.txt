By using the Site, you agree to the terms herein, including the collection and use of your information by us in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, then do not use the Site. Upon our belief that your conduct fails to conform with the Policy, we, in our sole discretion and without notice, reserve the right to block your access to this Site, to investigate and to involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and to pursue a civil action or criminal prosecution for any alleged or actual illegal activities involving this Site.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change the terms of this Policy. Since any changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page regularly. Your continued use of the Site following any changes to this Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
Information We Collect And How We Use It
We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address) unless you voluntarily choose to submit or otherwise disclose such information to us, including information submitted or disclosed by mail, telephone, fax or electronically. When you voluntarily submit information, it constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the purposes stated. We will only use your information to respond to your request for information, and will not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties. We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries. When we do so, these entities will use your information in a manner consistent with the purposes for which it was originally collected and to which you consented, and only as permitted under this Policy.
PLP web sites track information about the visits to those sites. For example, statistics are compiled that show the daily number of visitors to a site, the daily requests received for particular files on a site, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used to customize our web site to better meet your needs and may also be provided to others, but the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a web site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. Certain PLP sites may use cookies so that we can better serve site users. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
We have no obligation to monitor the Site or the use of the Site, or to retain the content of any user session. However, we reserve the right at all times to monitor, review, retain, and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request or to cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities in investigating a claim of illegal activity. We may use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, Site, clients, potential clients, and others.
Protection of Your Information
Protecting your information is important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect the security of your information. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk. We will not be liable for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, once we receive your transmission, we do our best to ensure its security on our systems by making reasonable efforts to protect the information.
