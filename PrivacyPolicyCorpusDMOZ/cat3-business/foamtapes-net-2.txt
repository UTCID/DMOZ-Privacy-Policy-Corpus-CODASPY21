Use of Cookies
The Foamtapes.net Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Foamtapes.net pages, or register with Foamtapes.net site or services, a cookie helps Foamtapes.net to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Foamtapes.net Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Foamtapes.net features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Foamtapes.net services or Web sites you visit.
Foamtapes.net uses Google Adwords tracking cookies for remarketing. This means you may see ads from us on other websites that are part of the Google Content Network (GCN). This allows us to continue to market our services to those who have shown interest in our service. As always we respect your privacy and are not collecting any identifiable information through the use of Google’s or any other 3rd party remarketing system. You may opt out of this technology at any time by using Google's opt out feature
