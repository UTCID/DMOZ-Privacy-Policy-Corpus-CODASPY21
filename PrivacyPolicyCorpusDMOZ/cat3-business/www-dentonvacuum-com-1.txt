This Privacy Policy applies only to us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and not to other companies’ or organizations’ sites to which we may link.Information Collected on The Denton WebsitePersonally Identifiable InformationThe majority of the information provided by Denton on the Denton Website is available to you without Denton collecting any information that is identifiable to you as an individual such as your name, email address, street address or telephone number (Personally Identifiable Information).

You transmit all such information at your own risk.Non-Personally Identifiable InformationThe second type of information collected on the Denton Website is Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as the type of Web browser you use, your domain name and links you may have used to locate the Denton Website, but which otherwise does not identify you individually. When you visit an Internet site, you disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet [Protocol] (IP) address, browser type, the time of your visit, and the referring location (e.g., the site page that offered a link to our Site page). Other information disclosed includes clickstream data, which includes a record of the clicked selections you make while visiting the Denton Website.
