CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
Your Rights Under the California Shine the Light Law (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1798.83)
California residents are permitted to opt out of the disclosure of their personal information, as defined in Cal. Civ. Code 1798.83 (e)(7), to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To opt out, email us at
us.privacy@swarovski.com or call us at +1 800-426-3088.
We will not disclose the personal information of California residents who have opted out to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
Your Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
California law requires businesses to disclose information regarding the rights of California residents pursuant to the CCPA. Any terms defined in the CCPA (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1798.140) have the same meaning when used in this section.
California residents may request that we disclose to them the following information covering the preceding 12 months:
­	- The categories of personal information we have collected about them;
­	- The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
­	- The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;
­	- The categories of third parties with which we share personal information;
­	- The categories of personal information about them that we have sold and the categories of third parties to which the personal information was sold;
­	- The categories of personal information about them that we have disclosed for a business purpose and the categories of third parties to which the personal information was disclosed;
­	- The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them.
A California resident may request the disclosure of the information listed above by calling +1 800-426-3088, submitting a request at
us.privacy@swarovski.com, or submitting a request at one of our retail locations.
Such a request may be referred to as a right to know request.
Pursuant to California law, we will verify the California resident’s identity before complying with any such request, which may include confirmation of the California resident’s name, email address, a recent purchase, and other information, as well as the California resident’s submission of a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that they are in fact the California resident whose personal information is the subject of the request.
To assist us in complying with your request, please provide your full name, email address, postal address, and Swarovski Club member number and/or Swarovski Crystal Society member number (if applicable) in your request, and provide information regarding a recent purchase (identify item, location where purchased, and approximate date).
Please be aware that if we cannot verify your identity from the information we already maintain, we may require additional information from you to verify your identity prior to complying with your request.
Such additional information will be used only for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes, and will be deleted as soon as practicable after processing your request.
If we are unable to verify your identity to the requisite degree of certainty, we will not be able to process your request and will so inform you and explain why.
A California resident has the right to request that we delete any personal information about the California resident that it has collected from the California resident, and that we direct any service provider to delete such personal information from its records. Such a request may be referred to as a request to delete.
However, pursuant to the CCPA, a California resident’s personal information may not be deleted under certain circumstances, including where maintenance of your personal information is necessary to: complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, to provide a good or service that they requested or that is reasonably anticipated within the context of their ongoing business relationship with us, or to otherwise perform a contract between Swarovski and you; to detect security incidents, protect against or prosecute fraudulent or illegal activity; to enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with their expectations based on their relationship with us; to comply with a legal obligation; or to otherwise use their information internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which they provided the information.
For more information about these and other situations in which we may not delete a California resident’s personal information, please see Cal. Civ. Code Section 1798.105(d).
A California resident may request the deletion of their personal information by calling +1 800-426-3088, submitting a request at us.privacy@swarovski.com,
or submitting a request at one of our retail locations. Before deleting a California resident’s personal information, we will obtain confirmation that the person wishes to have their personal information deleted and verify their identity, as required by the CCPA.
Verification may include confirmation of the California resident’s name, email address, a recent purchase, and other information, as well as the California resident’s submission of a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that they are in fact the California resident whose personal information is the subject of the request.
To assist us in complying with your request, please provide your full name, email address, postal address, and Swarovski Club member number and/or Swarovski Crystal Society member number (if applicable) in your request, and provide information regarding a recent purchase (identify item, location where purchased, and approximate date).
Please be aware that if we cannot verify your identity from the information we already maintain, we may require additional information from you to verify your identity prior to complying with your request.
Such additional information will be used only for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes, and will be deleted as soon as practicable after processing your request.
If we are unable to verify your identity to the requisite degree of certainty, we will not be able to process your request and will so inform you and explain why.
A California resident may use an authorized agent to submit a right to know request or a request to delete.
To use an authorized agent, the California resident must provide the agent with written authorization.
In addition, the California resident may be required to verify their own identity with us.
We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the California resident to act on their behalf. Such requirements, however, will not apply where a California resident has provided the agent with power of attorney pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code Sections 4000 to 4465.
In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information about California residents from the following sources and for the following purposes.
The CCPA requires that we refer to specific categories of personal information enumerated in the CCPA.
We may collect only certain pieces of personal information described in a given category and may not collect certain pieces of personal information described in each category.
In the preceding 12 months, we may have disclosed for a business purpose the following categories of personal information about California residents to the following categories of third parties (to the extent the disclosure was made to a third party).

Category of Source of Collection
Business or Commercial Purpose of Collection

Swarovski does not sell your personal information as that term is defined under the CCPA.
We will not discriminate against a California resident because the California resident exercised any of their rights under the CCPA, including, but not limited to, by:
- Denying goods or services to the California resident;
- Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
- Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the California resident; or
- Suggesting that the California resident will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may charge a California resident a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by that resident’s data.
In addition, we may offer financial incentives, including payments to California residents as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the sale of personal information, or the deletion of personal information.
We may also offer a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services to the California resident if that price or difference is directly related to the value provided to us by that resident’s data.
We will notify California residents of such financial incentives and. we will enter a California resident into a financial incentive program only if the California resident gives us prior opt in consent which clearly describes the material terms of the financial incentive program, and which may be revoked by the California resident at any time.
We will not use financial incentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature.
We currently offer the financial incentives listed below:
