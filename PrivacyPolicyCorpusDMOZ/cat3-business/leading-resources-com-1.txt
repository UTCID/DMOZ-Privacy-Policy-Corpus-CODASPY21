Survey User Protection Policy
At Leading Resources Inc., we are committed to providing our clients with the highest quality solutions possible. As part of our services, we develop and manage surveys of various types for our clients. Three examples are organizational surveys, 360 assessments, and customer satisfaction surveys.
We know that the best way for us to ensure quality results is by creating an environment where people responding to our surveys feel comfortable expressing their views openly and freely. Only by protecting the security and anonymity of people’s answers can we collect the most honest and accurate survey data.
For this reason, LRI has chosen to implement the following User Protection Policy: “For surveys of any type, no information linking a person’s name or account to their specific responses will be shared with anyone – except with that person’s express written permission.”
For more information on our User Protection Policy, please contact us at 1-800-598-7662.
