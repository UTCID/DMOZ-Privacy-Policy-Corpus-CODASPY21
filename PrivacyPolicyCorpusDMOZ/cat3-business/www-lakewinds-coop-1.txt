Privacy Policy
Lakewinds Food Co-op Privacy Policy
Since 1975, Lakewinds Food Co-op has been dedicated to providing the highest quality natural and organic products at a good value. As part of our cooperative principle to educate, we strive to inform customers about food, wellness and environmental issues. The Internet is one more way to provide helpful information.
Lakewinds’ website is open for members and shoppers alike. Lakewinds values the privacy of those using our website, and created this privacy policy for your information. Lakewinds understands that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will use the information wisely and legitimately.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “personally identifiable information” means information that identifies a particular individual, such as name, postal address, email address and phone number. When other information, such as email newsletter choices, owner purchases or product preferences, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information.
Please note: By visiting lakewinds.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

For example, our site’s registration process and online forms may require users to give us personal information such as their name, phone, email and mailing address, credit card information for processing an Ownership purchase, etc.
