ATA Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, and Social Media Guidelines
ATA Privacy Policy
The American Translators Association (ATA)
respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its website, www.atanet.org (the “Website”). ATA believes that if electronic
commerce and online activities are to flourish, consumers must be assured that
information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. This policy describes the
type of information we collect, how the information is used and for what
purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your
personal information.
If you do not agree with our policies, your
choice is to not use the ATA website or provide ATA with your information.
Collection,
Use, and Disclosure of Information
Most data ATA collects are used only
to help ATA better serve its members. It is our general policy to collect and
store only personal information that our members and visitors voluntarily provide.
Such personally identifiable information may include your name, company name,
email address, etc. (collectively referred to herein as "Personal
Information"). We do not sell, transfer, or disclose any Personal
Information we gather at our websites to any third parties without your prior
consent. There may be times when we share aggregate information—such as the
number of hits per page—with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and
other third parties in any effort to customize or enhance the content and
advertising on our sites for our users.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ATA
may disclose your personal information as required by law or as needed in legal
proceedings when ATA believes in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
fraud, or respond to a government request.
In addition, in the event of a
merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets to a
third party, we may also disclose your personal information to the third
parties. In the event of such a transaction, the personal information held by ATA
will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.
Credit
Card Account Information
ATA does not disclose credit card
account information provided by its members and customers. When members and
customers choose to pay using their credit cards, ATA submits the information
needed to the appropriate clearinghouse through secure sites to conduct the
transactions.
Security
Measures
This website has security measures in place to protect the
loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under ATA’s control. When you
enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) as part of the
enrollment process, we encrypt the transmission of that information using
secure socket layer technology (SSL).
When you submit information to ATA through our website, you
should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and
that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we
take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive
it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your
information.
Communications
From ATA
We will not send you promotional information without your
prior consent, and you can change your mind at any time by contacting us. If
you no longer wish to receive ATA’s promotional communications, you may opt-out
of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication
or by contacting us at ata@atanet.org.
International
Website Access and Cross-Border Data Transfers
If you are visiting the ATA website
from outside the United States, your information will be transferred to,
stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and ATA
is based. In addition, information that ATA collects may be stored and
processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which ATA operates
to enable the use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
You agree to such cross-border transfers of personal information.
Access and
Correction/Notice to All Users
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if
you no longer desire communications or information from ATA, you may correct,
update, amend, or deactivate it by making the change by contacting us at ata@atanet.org.
You may request a copy of the information ATA holds about
you so you can correct or amend information that may be inaccurate or incomplete
by writing to ata@atanet.org. In addition, we will ask you to provide sufficient
evidence of your identity for your own protection so we can ensure that
information is being released to the correct person. We will respond to your
request to access within 30 days.
To request the deletion of your information, please contact
us by writing to ata@atanet.org.  In some cases, our
business requirements and legal obligations may prevent us from being able to
delete your information. If we are unable to delete your information, we will
let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features
and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the
company providing it.
Amendments
and Updates

will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Any changes to our Privacy Policy
will be posted here so that Users will know what information we gather, how we
might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the
