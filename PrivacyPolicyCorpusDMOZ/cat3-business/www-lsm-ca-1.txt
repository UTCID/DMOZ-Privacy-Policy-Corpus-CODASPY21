For example, if you are applying for a mortgage or loan, or to co-sign or guarantee for another borrower, we ask for information concerning your employment and credit history to help determine your credit worthiness.

You may not withdraw your consent to the ongoing disclosure of your personal information to Credit Bureaus even after the mortgage or credit facility has been retired. This is necessary to help maintain accuracy, completeness and integrity of information held by Credit Bureaus.In the event you refuse or withdraw your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information about you, we may not be able to provide or continue to provide you with some products, services or information of value to you.

Each employee must sign an agreement acknowledging that maintaining confidentiality is a condition of employment.All information in our computer systems has built-in security features including multiple password restrictions. The service bureau handling our computer processing uses security standards comparable to our own, and they have entered into a Confidentiality Agreement pertaining to the personal information in our clients’ files.Other precautions, as simple as locking filing cabinets, contribute to our goal of protecting the privacy of information in our care.Your Information is Destroyed When it is No Longer NeededYour information is retained only as long as we need it for the products and services you are using, to offer you products and services when you are a customer and for a reasonable time thereafter, or to comply with any legal requirements.
