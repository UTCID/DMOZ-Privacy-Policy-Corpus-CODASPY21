Information Collected Automatically
To track how users are interacting with our Sites and improve performance, we may collect information during your visits to our Sites through our automatic data collection tools, which may include web beacons, cookies, embedded web links, pixel tags, and other commonly used information-gathering tools, as further described below. Some of these tools are necessary to the functionality of our Sites, while others help us make your visit to our Sites more efficient by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. Tech to My Door maintains its own pages on many social networking sites, and we may also collect information from you when you interact with our social networking pages.
Use of Cookies and Other Web Tracking Technologies
A “cookie” is a small piece of data stored on a user’s device. When you visit the Sites, Tech to My Door may place “cookies” on your device which allows us to compile information about Sites usage and to recognize you when you visit the Sites again. In addition, we use pixel tags “tiny graphic images ” to tell us what parts of our Sites our users have visited, or to measure the effectiveness of searches performed on our Sites. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that users can read and tell us whether emails have been opened to help assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our users. If you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your email address, we may associate our cookies and tags with that information.
Like many other companies, we use third-party partners to analyze data you provide to us or data about your browsing behavior that we collect when you visit our Sites. Our Sites may include tracking technology from Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics, Pardot, Rakuten Marketing, and other similar technologies. These tools provide us with analytical information, reports, and analysis about the use of our Sites and may record the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, the type of device and operating system you are using, your general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our Site, such as the page that led you to our Sites, how often you visit pages within our Sites, and other data related to the use of our Sites. We may also use these tools to create more targeted experiences or marketing messages and to help serve content that is relevant to you. For more information about these services, the related privacy policies and options available to you, please visit the websites of our analytics service providers listed above.
If you wish to avoid Tech to My Door’s use of these analytics services on our Sites, you may use any opt-out mechanisms provided by our analytics providers and/or actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete or disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. In addition, certain jurisdictions require companies to provide the ability for users to refuse the use of certain types of cookies that are not strictly necessary to the functionality of the site; accordingly, we have modified our Sites to enable such users to opt-out of the placement of cookies that are not strictly necessary to the functionality of the Sites.
In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Sites. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in our email messages.
Do Not Track Features
We want you to be aware that while some web browsers may let you enable a “do not track” feature within the browser itself that sends signals to the websites you visit in the browser, our Sites cannot respond to “do not track” signals at this time. Note that this is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies. The only way to completely opt-out of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools.
