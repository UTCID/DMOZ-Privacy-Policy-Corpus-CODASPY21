Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy The Pincus Group, Inc.
Effective 12/15/15
Privacy is a priority for the Pincus Group. We will never sell or make available any information you give us and we collect only information voluntarily given to us through direct contact.
When you contact us for information, we will contact you in direct response. We will not share your contact information with any third party. On occasion, we do ask clients to serve as references for other potential clients. We will always ask your permission before passing client information along for such references.
Clients are automatically enrolled in our occasional white paper or newsletter offerings, and can opt out at any point for these informational updates.
If payment for services is made by credit card, no personal information is retained or recorded beyond the authorized transaction. All information is secured and encrypted for that authorized transaction and accessed only by the employee responsible for billing. The Pincus Group never shares any identifiable information from any contact or client with any third party.
No part of our website or services collects or retains any information on minors and no personal account information is ever stored. We also have systems and procedures in place to verify caller identities in order to further protect your privacy and security.
