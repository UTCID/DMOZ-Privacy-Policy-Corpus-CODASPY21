Please note that U.S. Global is not responsible for the accuracy or content of websites of other providers that may have links from this Site. Accordingly, U.S. Global can make no representation concerning the content of these sites to you, nor can the fact that U.S. Global has provided this link serve as an endorsement by U.S. Global of this or any other site.

U.S. Global is providing this link only as a convenience to you. The inclusion of these links is not intended to reflect their importance, nor is it intended to endorse any views expressed, or products or services offered, on these outside sites, or the organizations sponsoring the sites. U.S. Global makes no warranties, explicit or implied, regarding the performance of the links, the performance of the outside sites or the contents of the outside sites. If you decide to access linked third party websites, you do so at your own risk.
Registration and Pin Numbers
U.S. Global encourages you to register in order to take full advantage of the information available on this Site. To make your experience easier and more convenient, we will store your registration information for future use. The information we store may include your name, Social Security number, and mailing and e-mail address. We may use the information you provide to electronically send you information related to this Site. Please refer to our privacy policy to learn about what information U.S. Global collects and why. In consideration of your use of the Site as a registered user, you agree to:
(a) Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Site’s registration form; and
(b) Maintain and promptly update the registration information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or U.S. Global has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, U.S. Global has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof).
When you register, you will be asked to select a PIN (personal identification number). You will also be given an opportunity to provide a PIN hint. If you forget your PIN, U.S. Global will provide you with the hint; however, to keep your information secure, U.S. Global cannot provide you with your PIN. Your PIN is your responsibility and must be protected. Treat your PIN to the Site as you would treat cash or your ATM PIN. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to each of the following:
(a) Not to give out your PIN to any other person. U.S. Global may rely on your PIN to identify you when providing services to you.
(b) Never to leave your PC unattended while using the Site.
(c) To always log off the system after using the Site.
(d) To notify U.S. Global immediately if you suspect that your PIN has become known to any unauthorized person. Please be aware that the policy regarding the unauthorized use of your PIN is very different from the policy your bank may have regarding unauthorized use of your credit card or ATM card. Unlike the bank, U.S. Global is not required to, and will not, insure you against the unauthorized use of your PIN. Rather, you are responsible for any activity via the Site using your PIN.
Security
Our highest priority is to ensure the privacy of your accounts. We take steps to ensure that your communications and transactions with U.S. Global through our website are as safe and reliable as any other means of doing business with us. Rest assured that U.S. Global will treat your registration information and other data with the appropriate safety and security features and confidentiality standards.
Our Account Access service uses a secure communications link between your computer and our computer networks. We have a digital certificate installed that uses a special means of communicating with your browser called Secure Sockets Layer Protocol (SSL). This establishes a digital handshake with your computer that verifies that when you connect to our website, you are establishing a secure connection. To provide you with access to your accounts from our website, we require the use of a Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer browser that supports 128-bit encryption. The 128-bit designation refers to the length of the key used to encrypt or scramble the data being transmitted.
On some systems, the Account Access section appears to be non-secure (the key or lock on the browser window appears broken) because of the site’s use of frames. This occurs because the browser will only secure the necessary page parts such as the account access frame; the actual data transfer over internet still occurs with SSL security. If for any reason you exit the Account Access system, your encrypted session will be interrupted, and you will need to log in again when returning to the Account Access system. For additional information on security, please click here.
Please note that e-mail may not be encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting information.
Logging Off
Be certain to log off after accessing information on this Site. If you leave your computer and your session hasn’t “timed out,” or automatically shut down, another user could more easily access your account and any personal information therein.
Indemnification
YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD COMPLETELY HARMLESS U.S. GLOBAL FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION CLAIMS BASED UPON THE NEGLIGENCE OF U.S. GLOBAL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THE MATERIALS IT CONTAINS, THE USE OF YOUR PIN TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, AND ANY SITES LINKED TO THIS SITE.

Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by clicking here or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser.
Read additional important information.
Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
