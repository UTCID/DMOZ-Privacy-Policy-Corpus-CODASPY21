Barium terms & legal documents
Here we have collected all of our terms and conditions
Updated agreements August 2020
DPA is an integral part of the Agreement (GT&C)
The current text of the agreement governing the processing of personal data is being supplemented with a written DPA (Data Processor Agreement). This DPA governs how Barium, as a processor of personal data, processes the personal data which you as a customer and the controller of personal data choose to process in our platform. We have produced a data processor agreement, which is well balanced and adapted to the Barium Live service. This DPA applies automatically and thus no extra approval is required.
Updated DPA aug 2020
The European Court of Justice decided in June 2020 to declare the Privacy Shield invalid as an adequate protection mechanism for 3rd country's transfers of personal data to the United States. Barium has acted on this and has introduced the EU's approved standard contract clauses in the Data protection amendments with each subcontractor we use. On top of this we constantly review our subcontractor's technical protection and security measures to ensure that they are adequate. For questions or clarifications, please contact privacy@barium.se
