How UMB helps protect its customers
Secure online banking sessions
Our online banking platform is built using a secure URL certificate using http Secure (https) which can be identified where the closed padlock icon is displayed in the URL address bar. This additional browser protection provides a secure connection to UMB and helps prevent intrusions into your online banking session.
Text and email alerts
Online banking customers can set up account alerts that notify them when balances hit a preset amount, transactions are processed or when checks clear. This real-time data provides better account management, improved monitoring options, and early fraud detection for unauthorized purchases.
Session "Timeout"
To prevent unauthorized access to your information if your computer is left unattended, online banking customers are automatically logged out of their online banking account after being inactive for a preset period of time.
Digital banking security
UMB uses two-factor authentication to provide an added layer of protection when you bank online or through our mobile application. Two-factor authentication allows you to access UMB online and mobile banking by validating your identity each time you log in.

Important Information
