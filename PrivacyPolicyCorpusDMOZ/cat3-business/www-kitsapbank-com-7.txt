You may need to upgrade your browser(s) to disable TLS 1.0 and use TLS 1.1 or higher. If it is determined your browser has not disabled TLS 1.0, you will not be able to access the Online Banking or Cash Management Services, including Bill Pay. Browsers that have TLS 1.0 enabled may get a warning that stronger security is required. Please upgrade your browser to use TLS 1.1 or higher.You can verify if your browser already has TLS 1.0 disabled by copying and pasting this URL into your browser: https://tls1test.salesforce.com/s/.If you have questions about logging in of using these services, please contact our Customer Service Center toll-free at 800.283.5537, option 7 (Monday - Friday, 8am - 5pm).What is a Secure Access Code?The Secure Access Code is system generated and will be sent to the delivery method you choose. In today's online environment, login ID/password access to your financial information is no longer considered sufficient to securely verify your identity.Therefore, in addition to your login ID and password, our online verification requires us to deliver you a one-time piece of required information via something only you possess (for example, your email account or your telephone). Once you receive the additional piece of information (a Secure Access Code) and enter it into our system, you have the option to register your browser with a cookie for future use.Please note: Secure Access Codes cannot be delivered via email to Cash Management clients.Why do I need to register my device?Once you have successfully logged in to our Online Banking system, during each subsequent login, the Online Banking system will check your computer for a cookie (a tiny bit of information) that shows that your device has been registered. If the cookie is present, the Online Banking system will allow you to access your account information by entering your User Name and Password (or Touch ID or 4 digit Passcode, if set up).If the cookie is not present, the Online Banking system will prompt you to request a new Secure Access Code in order to gain access to your account information. Once the Secure Access Code is entered, you will have two choices for accessing your Online Banking. If you select, “Register Device”, your device will be registered and a cookie will be added to your browser. If you select “Do Not Register Device”, your device will not be registered and a cookie will not be added to your browser. In this case, each subsequent login will require you to enter a new Secure Access Code when accessing your accounts from this device until the device is registered.These cookies are both device and browser specific. Once a cookie has been added to your browser, it will remain active for one year or until the cookie is removed or deleted. If you access the Online Banking system using a different browser or using a different device entirely, a new Secure Access Code will be required. This security feature provides an extra level of protection to you.I need additional help with Online Banking.  Where can I call?Telephone support available Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM PST360.874.1088 800.2TELLER (800.283.5537), Option 7
