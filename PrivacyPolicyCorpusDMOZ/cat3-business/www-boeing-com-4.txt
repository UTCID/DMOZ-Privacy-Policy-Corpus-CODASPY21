Information collected automatically
Boeing uses various digital analytics tools to collect data for metrics, fraud prevention, and service improvement purposes and to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor. Each time you visit Boeing Services, we may automatically collect certain types of information. Some examples of information automatically collected are as follows:
Your IP address and approximate physical location, MAC address, browser type, operating system, device-identifying information, type of computer or device, and type of Web browser software, the specific webpages visited during your connection, and the domain name from which you accessed the Boeing Services.
Information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Boeing Services, the areas or pages of the Boeing Services that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the Boeing Services, the number of times you return to the Boeing Services and other clickstream data.
We may use “cookies” of different types to recognize your device. A cookie is a small text file that a website, online application, or e-mail may save to your Web browser and/or your device memory for use in subsequent visits to the Site or other sites. See below for more information on cookies.
We may use web beacons, match scripts, pixel tags or similar technologies that allow us to know if a particular web page was visited, an e-mail opened, or links in the email used. In some instances, these technologies may allow us to match activities with particular users.
When you visit Boeing Services and you have not otherwise identified yourself (e.g., via registration with a Boeing Service), our web servers automatically recognize your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We also collect firmographic information about your company, if you are visiting Boeing Services from your company domain. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use and traffic patterns to improve the Services that we offer.
Cookies and tracers Cookies are currently the best way to effectively identify unique website visitors and understand how they navigate our Services. Cookies are small data files placed on your device by a website when you visit. Boeing uses cookies set by us or other companies for tracking purposes or to make our Services easier to use and tailored for individual users. Like many websites, we do not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers except where legally required. But with most Web browsers, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your device and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your device is up to you.
Boeing uses, and permits service providers to use, tracking scripts or "tracers" and web beacons that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your device by another website. For example, we use a tracer to determine whether you visit our pages after visiting a site where we placed a banner ad. We also use these technologies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email or other communications, to measure performance, and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image that can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. For example, we include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether our messages have been opened or interacted with and whether our mailing tools are working properly.
While our cookie names will change over the course of time, they generally fall into the following categories:

Organizational Services Data Many Boeing Services are intended for use by organizations. If you interact with our Services through an account provided by your organization, the organization typically administers your Services account, and controls and accesses your data, including the contents of files stored on our Services. Boeing is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of organizational customers, which differ from those set forth in this Statement, as they are administered by these organizations. The types of data processed by our Services include the following:
Date type
Description
Customer Data
Data, including traveler profiles, maintenance records, and other text or image files provided to Boeing by you or your organization through use of our Services. Customer Data is used to provide the Services, including compatible related purposes. For example, we use Customer Data to provide a personalized experience, improve service reliability, combat spam or other malware, or to improve features and functionality of the Services.
Boeing processes Customer Data under the direction of organizational customers, and has no direct control or ownership of the Customer Data it processes. The organizations are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring Customer Data to Boeing for processing purposes.
We will not disclose Customer Data outside of Boeing except as a customer directs, as described here or in relevant agreement(s), as required by law, or in response to legitimate governmental requests. Should law enforcement contact Boeing with a lawful demand for Customer Data, Boeing will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from the organizational customer. In support of the above, Boeing provides basic organizational contact information to the third party.
Account Data
Information provided to Boeing during sign-up, purchase, or administration of the organizational Services. Account Data includes the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses you provide, as well as aggregated usage information related to your organization’s accounts and administrative data. We use Account Data to provide the Services, complete transactions, service the account, and detect and prevent fraud.
We use Account Data to contact your organization to provide information about accounts, subscriptions, billing, and updates to the Services, including information about new features, security or other technical issues. We also contact your organization regarding government or other third-party inquiries we receive regarding its use of the Services. You or your organization will not be able to unsubscribe from these non-promotional communications. Subject to contact preferences, we also send promotional communications about our products and services. You can manage your contact preferences in your account profile or by contacting your Boeing sales representative.
With limited exceptions, Boeing processes Account Data under the direction of its organizational customers, and has no direct control or ownership of the personal data it processes. The organizations are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring Account Data to Boeing for processing purposes.
We share Account Data or Payment Data with third parties for purposes of fraud prevention, to process payment transactions, or to enable a requested purchase, subscription, or use of a third-party offering.
Payment Data
Includes payment instrument number (e.g., credit card), name and billing address, the security code associated with the payment instrument, organizational tax ID, and other financial data. Organizations that make purchases will be asked to provide Payment Data, which we use to complete transactions, as well as to detect and prevent fraud. When you provide Payment Data online, we will store that data to help you complete future transactions.
You can update or remove Payment Data associated with your organization’s account by logging in to individual Services or by contacting customer support. After you close an account or remove Payment Data, however, Boeing will retain that information for as long as reasonably necessary to complete transactions, to comply with Boeing’s legal and reporting requirements, and to detect and prevent fraud.
Support Data
Information we collect when you contact or engage Boeing for support. It includes information you submit in a support request, or about the condition of the device and the app where an error may have occurred, including error-tracking files. We use Support Data to resolve your support incident.
In addition to using Support Data to resolve your support incident, we also use it to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer. Phone conversations, online chat sessions, or remote troubleshooting sessions with support professionals are recorded and/or monitored. Following a support incident, we typically send you a survey about your experience.
Telemetry Data
Information we collect that tells us how our Services are performing and being used. It includes information about when and how long a Service is used, which features are accessed, and the physical location of devices used to access our Services. It also includes information about hardware, software, and other details gathered related to usage, authentication, diagnostics, errors encountered, or the condition of the device and the Service when an error occurred.

Disclosure of personal information When you provide personal information to Boeing or its entities and brands, we share that information with other Boeing entities and brands to provide a more unified customer experience.
Certain Services must disclose information to third parties assisting us in processing a transaction requested by you (e.g., credit card service providers). In addition, Boeing hires service providers to perform work on its behalf. Any such service providers will be permitted to obtain data from the Services only to deliver the services Boeing has retained them to provide and will be prohibited from using data for any other purpose. Boeing discloses personal information to these service providers for the purposes identified in Collection and use of personal information, including to send promotional communications to you via email, postal mail, fax, SMS and phone as permitted by local law and subject to your contact preferences. In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas, or court orders, to protect Boeing and/or Boeing's systems and customers, to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to ensure the integrity and operation of Boeing and/or Boeing business and systems, Boeing accesses and discloses the necessary and appropriate information under the circumstances.
Location of data processing Personal information that Boeing processes is transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Boeing or its affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. The data protection laws in these countries are different from, and could be less stringent than, those in your country of residence. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.
Retention of personal information Boeing stores your personal information for as long as you use the Services, and no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected, or for which it is legitimately further processed. Thereafter, Boeing retains personal information for a period of time set forth in its corporate retention schedules. In the case of organizational Services data, Boeing retains personal information according to the timeframes set forth in relevant customer agreements, or in lieu of an agreement, for as long as a legitimate business purpose exists.
Security of personal information Boeing is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We have implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental loss, destruction or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. The Internet, however, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure the security of any personal information provided to us.
Children’s privacy In general, Boeing does not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children, as defined by local law. If you believe that we have collected personal information about a child, please Contact Us so that we can delete the information. Additionally, please Contact Us to request removal of content or information that was posted to our Services when the registered user was under the age of 18.
However, some Services may collect, use or disclose personal information from children (as defined by local law) where it is necessary to do so; for example, a child member of a group using International Trip Planning Services (ITPS). This information is necessary to fulfil travel arrangements, ensure safety, to meet legal and regulatory requirements, and to provide, or arrange for appropriate assistance or facilities where necessary. This information will be collected with the consent of a responsible adult or guardian where possible. The personal information will be appropriately designated for extra protections and review and removal at the earliest opportunity. This personal information from children will be flagged to avoid direct marketing.
