Security Of Information
Our website uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SLL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology, to provide encryption of personal information such as your name, address and credit card details. In this way, information passed between your computer and our website cannot be read in the unlikely event of someone intercepting it. All credit and debit card transactions are secure. We will only accept orders using SSL/TLS technology-this means you cannot inadvertently reveal personal information by using an unsecured connection. In order for SSL/TLS security to work, you must use an SSL/TLS enabled browser.
Please note that email encryption is not always secure, so please use our website for placing your order. If you still have reservations, you can call to place your order at 1-800-231-5988.
We do not show your credit card details on any paperwork. To prevent fraudulent or unauthorized use of credit cards for first-time buyers, we insist that your first order is delivered directly to the card holder's registered address. Additionally, we randomly select orders for authorization checks prior to processing.
Data Security
In the event of a data breach where your personal information is at risk, we are obligated to notify you, the consumer, as to the extent of the data breach, and what steps are being undertaken to resolve the issue. By law, if your personal data is compromised, we will notify you within 72 hours upon learning of the security incident.
