H20 Insights: Municipal Water & Wastewater Infrastructure Funding Overview, July 2020
Insituform® CIPP has been used for more than 45 years to protect pipelines from corrosion, restore structural integrity, reduce infiltration, eliminate leaking joints, improve water quality and increase pipeline flow capacity. We offer a variety of solutions for renewing wastewater and stormwater pipelines as well as pressurized force mains and water distribution and transmission mains.
We can quickly install our trenchless CIPP solutions in areas not accessible to dig and replace methods. We have renewed pipelines beneath interstates, bridges, busy roadways, airports and military installations without disrupting traffic. Our CIPP tube is designed to meet individual project specifications, and our manufacturing capabilities are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 standard by SAI Global (Certificate No.: CERT-0101077), with each tube tracked from start to finish. Additionally, our regional distribution system helps keep transportation costs to a minimum.
