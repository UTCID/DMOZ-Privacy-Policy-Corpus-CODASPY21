In doing this, we make particular use of what are known as standard contractual clauses stipulated by the European Commission, which can be ac-cessed here , here and here , or rules known as binding corporate rules for an appropriate level of protection or we rely on the legal exceptions of consent, contract processing, determination, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, predominant public interests, published personal data or because it is necessary to protect the integrity of the person concerned.   Retention period for personal data Moser-Baer AG processes and stores your personal data for as long as it is required for the fulfilment of contractual and legal obligations or other purposes monitored for processing and also in accordance with legal retention and documentation obligations.

As soon as your personal data is no longer required for the aforementioned purposes, it will be deleted, or anonymised, as far as this is possible.   Measures to protect your data Moser-Baer AG takes appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised access and misuse, such as controlling access to buildings, network security, employee training, encryption of data, media, etc. The security guidelines and procedures are reviewed regularly to enable us to determine the effectiveness of technical and operational measures.   Rights of the person concerned Within the context of the data protection law applicable to you and as far as provision is made (such as in the case of the GDPR), you have the right to information, amendment, deletion and otherwise restriction of data processing and to object to our processing your data and to the publishing of certain personal data for the purpose of transmission elsewhere (known as data portability). However, please note that we reserve the right to assert the limitations provided for by law, if, for example, we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have a major interest in this data (provided that we may rely on that) or if it is required for the enforcement of any claims. If charges are payable, we shall inform you in advance. We have already informed you of the option to revoke your consent in clause 3. Please note that exercising these rights may conflict with contractual agreements and may have consequences, such as early contract termination or cost implications. If this is the case, we shall inform you in advance, if this is not already covered by the contract. Exercising these rights usually requires you to provide clear proof of your identity (e.g. by providing a copy of your ID card or passport if your identity is not otherwise clear or cannot be verified). To exercise your rights, you may contact us at the address specified in clause 1. Furthermore, all persons concerned have the right to assert their claims or submit a complaint to the responsible data protection authority. The responsible data protection authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch).   Procedure regarding a breach of data protection If Moser-Baer AG identifies a breach of data protection, that is to say if sensitive data is lost or accessed, amended, used or otherwise misused by unauthorised persons, the following steps are initiated:
