Policy - Accessibility
Accessibility
Go Back
Technology is changing our world and lives for the better, including for people with disabilities and age-related limitations. For such individuals, internet-, hardware- and software-based solutions help empower them at home, in school, and in the workplace, enabling them to access information, entertainment, education, and employment opportunities from nearly anywhere in the world.ITI is the leading technology industry voice for accessibility policies and standards. Working closely with governments, consumers, and a range of industry sectors around the world, we encourage policymakers to focus on desired performance and outcomes rather than technical prescriptions, allowing the technology industry the flexibility to innovate and compete to deliver cost-effective solutions that empower everyone, regardless of ability.
To assist government contracting officials and other buyers in identifying commercially available information and communications technology with accessible features, ITI has developed the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template®, or VPAT® to create Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs).
ITI welcomes questions or comments on this or any other matter related to ICT accessibility. Please contact us for further information.
In-Depth: VPAT
ITI is the creator the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT, a recommended reporting format for enhancing industry-customer communications on ICT product and service conformance with relevant accessibility standards and guidelines.
