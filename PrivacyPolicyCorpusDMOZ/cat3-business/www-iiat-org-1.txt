How to Deal with Gaps in Homeowners and Auto Policies
7.5 hour/7.5 CE credit
$175 member/$215 nonmember
This class is designed to look at the changes that have occurred, not just in our families, but in how we use our property.  For example, letting others rent our homes on a short-term basis, but holding these homes out to rent throughout the calendar year.  Purchasing and using drones and looking into how the homeowners policy responds to these “aircraft”, and what individual insurance companies are doing to address this issue.  Thinking about using property differently than our parent’s generation did, what about Car Sharing?  Or, how about picking up a part time job delivering pizza?  Or maybe, driving for companies like Uber and Lyft?  What is it, how does the industry view these, and what has ISO done to deal with these increasing risks?
