See Section 9 (Definitions).Password Protected Pages and Open Pages. Each website that hosts one of our K-12 Learning Platforms (a "Platform Website") is divided into two areas: (i) a password-protected area that provides Online Educational Content and that is designed to be available only to Platform Users who hold requisite passwords for their use ("Password Protected Pages"); and (ii) an open area, that provides General Information and certain educational content to users without password requirements ("Open Pages").Relationship with Your School. HMH enters into relationships with Schools and other Educators, whereby HMH agrees to provide their Administrators, Teachers, Students and other associated individuals with access to its Platforms. These Terms address such access.Use of Our Platforms.

Educators select the Students (and, where applicable, the parents or legal guardians) who will have access to the K-12 Learning Platform and the associated School-Designated Educational Content. The School and its Administrators/Teachers are responsible for registering Students.

School-Designated Educational Content. Educators select the Online Educational Content and K-12 Learning Platform features (where applicable) that will be available for their classrooms ("School-Designated Educational Content"). We then provide this School-Designated Educational Content in accordance with these Terms.
School Code of Conduct. The School is responsible for the conduct of its Students in connection our K-12 Learning Platforms. We encourage Schools and Teachers to apply appropriate codes of conduct to student activities in this regard.
