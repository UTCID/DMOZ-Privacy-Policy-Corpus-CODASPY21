NRCA reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics to measure interest in and use of the various areas of its website and inform advertisers of such information, as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners, sponsored content, etc. NRCA will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.
Registration and order forms
To attend events, meetings, conferences and request products, you may be required to fill out a registration or order form and provide personally identifiable information that NRCA will use to process your registration or order. In addition, your name and information may appear on registration or attendee lists distributed at NRCA events, meetings and conferences to other attendees and third parties.
