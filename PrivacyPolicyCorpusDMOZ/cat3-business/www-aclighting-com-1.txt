By using the website www.aclighting.com (the “Website”), including, but not limited to, registering, making purchases, ordering products, goods and/or services, reviewing past orders and accounts, and/or any other use of the Website whatsoever (the “Use”), the Buyer is agreeing to the terms and conditions within this policy and all ancillary policies.
We, A.C. Lighting, Inc. (“we”, “us”, the “Seller” or “ACL” herein), may from time to time review and revise this policy. A revised policy will be effective and binding on you at the time it is posted on the Website.

1.2 Offer and Acceptance:
The Contract represents the entire terms on which the Seller is willing to sell Goods, and by ordering Goods from the Seller, the Buyer agrees that the Contract represents the entire agreement between the Buyer and the Seller and that the Conditions shall apply to the exclusion of any previous terms and conditions supplied by the Seller, the Buyer’s own terms and conditions, any pre-contractual statement, any terms implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing or any other terms of whatsoever nature not contained herein. The Buyer acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of the Seller which is not set out in the Contract.

If the Buyer fails to accept delivery of the Goods within three (3) business days after the Seller has notified the Buyer that the Goods are ready, then, except where such failure or delay is caused by the Seller’s failure to comply with its obligations under the Contract:
delivery of the Goods shall be deemed to have been completed at 4.00 pm on the third business day following the day on which the Seller notified the Buyer that the Goods were ready; and
the Seller may store the Goods until delivery actually takes place, and charge the Buyer for all related costs and expenses (including insurance) as well as a daily storage fee of $50.00  plus any applicable taxes.

5.2 The price of the Goods is exclusive of the costs and charges of packaging and transport of the Goods, which costs and charges shall be paid by the Buyer when it pays for the Goods.

cancel any contract to supply further Goods;
suspend use of the Website and deliveries of further Goods to the Buyer; and
assess a service charge equal to the lesser of (i) one and a half percent (1.5%) per month on the outstanding past due balance and (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law, plus any costs of collection including attorney’s fees. Such service charge shall accrue from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.

payment in full of the price of the Goods sold hereby, and
payment in full of every other sum owing by the Buyer to the Seller.

The security interest also covers and includes all equipment, accounts, general intangibles, fixtures, and other personal property used, or acquired for use, in connection with the use or operation of the Goods, or otherwise related to the Goods. The Seller shall have all rights available to a secured party with a perfected security interest in the event of the Buyer’s default.
6.3 In addition and without limitation, in the event that the Buyer shall sell the Goods before title has passed as aforesaid, he shall do so as the agent of the Seller and the proceeds shall belong to the Seller unless and until payment in full as provided for in Section 6.1 shall have been made. The proceeds of sale shall be kept in a separate account identified as containing monies from the sale of the Seller’s property and the Buyer shall account to the Seller for the whole of such proceeds collected by the Buyer.
6.4 Without limiting any of the Seller’s other rights, if the Buyer fails to make full payment of the price of the Goods when due, the Seller shall be at liberty at any time:
by notice in writing to require the Buyer forthwith to return the Goods whereupon the Buyer shall cease to be in possession of them with the consent of the Seller; or
to retake possession of the Goods and for that purpose to enter on any premises where the Goods are or are reasonably believed by the Seller to be situated.

The exclusive remedy shall not be deemed to have failed of its essential purpose so long as the Seller is willing and able to replace defective Goods or provide a credit adjustment in the prescribed manner.
8.2 The Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that: (a) the Buyer has, without the Seller’s assistance, determined its requirements for the Goods and that the Buyer has determined that the design and specifications of the Goods are capable of fulfilling the purposes for which the Buyer intends to use the Goods; (b) the Goods are purchased for the purpose for which they were manufactured; (c) the Buyer has all the licenses that are required for the use of the Goods; (d) the Goods will be tested prior to use; (e) the Goods will only be used by suitably qualified individuals; (f) the Goods will be regularly serviced, tested, certified and inspected; (g) the Goods will not in any way be adapted or altered; and (h) the Buyer will not give or imply any warranty to any person whom the Buyer may sell or let the Goods other than the manufacturer’s warranty and that the Buyer will notify that person of the requirements of the Seller as to license, test, use, service, inspection, certification, and adaptation as above and of any statutory authority of any province, state or country in which the Buyer or that person is resident or carrying on business.
8.3 If and to the extent assignable, the Seller hereby assigns to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall have the benefit of, any applicable manufacturer’s warranties with respect to the Goods, provided, however, that the Buyer’s sole remedy for the breach of any such warranty shall be against the manufacturer and not against the Seller.  If the Goods are returned by the Buyer or repossessed by the Seller, all such manufacturer’s warranties will be automatically reassigned by the Buyer to the Seller (without the need of written instrument or other formality) free and clear of all liens, security interests and other encumbrances.
8.4 These warranties and limitations shall apply to any repaired or replacement Goods supplied by the Seller.
