Flying Lessons Near Me.
Flying Lessons are much like driving lessons, save for a few crucial differences. You'll have hours of training in a plane as opposed to a car (at least 45 hours of flight), and instead of driving to get your driving licence, you’ll be flying to get your Private Pilot’s Licence (PPL).
We have a selection of ‘Taster’ packages, available as 30 minute or 60 minute sessions. These are a great way to try out flying - you can get to see if it’s for you, and if you’d like to go all the way and obtain a licence (which is required to be a professional pilot).
Or you can just enjoy a one-off experience flying a plane. Either way, it’s a really enjoyable day out. Lessons are as much about the pre-flight checks as they are about the time spent in the air, amongst the clouds, thousands of feet above the ground.
Flying tuition and pilot lessons are given by fully qualified and licensed flight instructors from approved training organisations like the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority), and they will be on hand to ensure your safety is a prime consideration at all times, so you can focus on getting maximum enjoyment out of the experience.
Thanks to their years of experience, they will be on hand with extensive and invaluable aviation knowledge to anyone lucky enough to be given one of our gift vouchers as a gift, or flying lessons booked for yourself to tick off the bucket list or live the dream of being a fully licensed pilot.
Set you or a loved one on the way to achieving a Private Pilot’s Licence - or even just for some quality airborne time today with FlyDays.
IMPORTANT: We advise you to ensure you thoroughly check the itinerary for the vouchers that you are browsing, as some packages such as our Helicopter Rides are not classed as a lesson, and you will simply be a passenger sightseeing rather than taking over the controls.
Flying Lessons are Expensive, Right?
Now, the answer to this is both yes and no, and here’s why. Generally, there seems to be a misconception that learning how to fly and pilot training can be really expensive.
This statement is true if you are looking to become a fully qualified commercial pilot and fly with commercial airlines. But if you are looking to get your private licence, then the cost of flying lessons can be much more affordable than you’d think.
Here at FlyDays, we believe that everyone should, at least once, get into the cockpit of a light aircraft and feel the buzz of flying a plane. That’s why, thanks to our competitive pricing, we are able to offer cheap lessons to suit all budgets and needs.
If you are not looking at getting your licence, then a cheaper but just as fun alternative would be to look at booking one of our passenger experiences. We have a wide range of experiences at affordable prices to meet anyone’s aviation dreams or ambitions.
What Flying Courses are Available?
We have a fantastic selection of flying lessons and training courses. These consist of both fixed-wing and helicopter flying lessons. We also offer various options in terms of packages. These consist of everything, from short 15 Minute taster sessions, to the more challenging 30 Minute lessons. Either of these options could be used as trial flying lessons.
If you were looking to be up in the air for a little longer in a session, with a more hands-on approach, there’s always our 60 Minute lessons or our tactical helicopter experiences to try out. We also have lessons where the time spent in the air can count towards obtaining your Private Pilot’s Licence.
So whatever your budget, and whatever your requirements are, we’re confident that you’ll be able to find a flying lesson or training course to suit your needs.
Are There Any Flying Schools Near Me?
We have the largest selection of flight schools, training centres, airfields and aerodromes across the UK. So whether you’re down in Cornwall at Bodmin Airfield, or up in Scotland at Cumbernauld Airport, a flying school is closer to you than you might think.
Our locations vary in size, from small family-run businesses or privately run aero clubs, to larger commercial airports and flight schools. Most venues have use of a runway, whether grass or Asphalt, and additional facilities such as hangarage, maintenance and refuelling can also be found.
Many of the airfields listed on our site, such as Eaglescott Airfield in Devon, offer a range of flying lessons, as well as flying experiences including Gliding, Microlights and Vintage Flying. If you are interested in discovering what each airfield/airport has to offer, head to our dedicated Airfields page.
Booking a Flying Lesson with FlyDays
Whether you are looking to either book a lesson for yourself, start yourself or anyone else on the path to a PPL course, or just surprise a loved one or friend with a gift of a lifetime, look no further than FlyDays.co.uk.
You can either browse through the flying lessons listed below, or you could use our Locations page to find a lesson nearest to you for convenience.
If you are buying a gift and you are not sure which type of lesson (fixed-wing or helicopter) your recipient would prefer, you could always purchase one of our open gift vouchers. Simply choose a value between £50 - £400 and we will send an open voucher via email or post - we also have additional gift wrap options available when you check out.
The recipient can then simply book the lesson that they want for when they want to attend, offering them great flexibility and - hopefully - memories to last a lifetime. They may even choose another experience if they prefer.
