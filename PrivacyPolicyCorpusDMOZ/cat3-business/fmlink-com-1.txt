by Brianna Crandall — September 25, 2020 — The Security Industry Association (SIA), a trade association representing security solutions providers around the world, has released its new policy principles guiding the development and deployment of facial recognition technology. SIA believes all technology products, including facial recognition, must only be used for purposes that are lawful, ethical and nondiscriminatory.SIA CEO Don Erickson stated:article continues belowSIA recognizes that some community leaders have expressed deeply held views calling for the end of facial recognition technology use by law enforcement and the private sector. We respectfully but firmly disagree. Facial recognition technology offers tremendous benefits to society when used effectively and responsibly and with appropriate safeguards. We invite all stakeholders to review these well-thought-out principles and engage with us in meaningful discussions leading to commonsense approaches to how this technology is used.SIA has committed to the following principles to be used in the development and deployment of facial recognition technology. SIA believes that that these principles should apply to implementation of facial recognition tools across safety and security applications, in both public- and private-sector settings, and that they should be reflected in development of any organizational or public policies addressing these uses of the technology.SIA’s core principles include:Ensuring transparency surrounding the use of facial recognitionEstablishing a clear and defined purpose for the use of facial recognition by organizationsUsing high-performing and accurate technologyIncorporating human oversight and reviewProtecting data securityEnsuring privacy by designTraining and educating users of technologyImproving or eliminating biased or discriminatory softwareMaintaining ethical acquisition of facial recognition technologyThese core policy principles were developed by and with input from many SIA members, including members of the SIA Facial Recognition Working Group, the SIA Data Privacy Advisory Board, and the SIA Executive Committee. In addition to these core principles, the new document includes guidelines around the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement and in the public and private sectors.SIA Principles for the Responsible and Effective Use of Facial Recognition Technology is available for free download from the SIA website. FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
