Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict, impair, encumber, alter, deprive, or adversely affect the Apps or any of Synaptive’s rights or interests therein or any other Synaptive intellectual property, brands, information, content, processes, methodologies, products, goods, services, materials, or rights, tangible or intangible. All rights, title, and interest in and to the Apps not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Synaptive. You may from time to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to Synaptive with respect to the Apps (“Feedback”). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, shall not create any confidentiality obligation for Synaptive notwithstanding anything else. You shall, and hereby do, grant to Synaptive a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use and exploit the Feedback for any purpose.
3.2 Customer Content. You grant Synaptive a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as set forth in Section 9.1) license, without a right of sublicense, to access, use, reproduce, electronically distribute, transmit, perform, format, display, store, archive, and index the Customer Content for the purpose of supporting your use of the Apps and providing Apps to you. Synaptive may also use Customer Content for the purpose of supporting and developing the Site, provided that when doing so, Synaptive shall only use Customer Content in an anonymized and aggregated way. Subject only to the limited license expressly granted herein, you and your Authorized Users shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Content and all intellectual property rights therein. Nothing in this Agreement will confer on Synaptive any right of ownership or interest in the Customer Content or the intellectual property rights there
3.3 Responsibility for Customer Content and Mentions. You are solely responsible for the Customer Content that you or Authorized Users upload, publish, display, link to, or otherwise make available via the Apps, and you agree that Synaptive is only acting as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of the Customer Content and the online display of Queries and Mentions. Synaptive will not review, share, distribute, or reference any Customer Content or Mentions except as provided herein, as provided in Synaptive’s privacy policy, or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Synaptive retains the authority to remove any Customer Content uploaded that it deems in violation of this Agreement, at its sole discretion.
4. Synaptive Products and Fees
4.1 Purchases By Authorization Form. If an Authorization Form is issued for the purchase of Services, you agree to pay all fees as and when described per the Authorization Form(s). Synaptive shall invoice you for the Fees in the currency set forth on the applicable Authorization Form. Unless otherwise stated on the Authorization Form, all invoices shall be payable within 30 days of the invoice date. Any disputed amounts shall not affect payment of non-disputed amounts. You shall make payments to the entity and address set forth in the invoice.
4.2 Synaptive Pro and PAID Apps. For Synaptive Pro and PAID apps, and other paid services made available by Synaptive (“Paid Services”), you must provide Synaptive with a valid credit card or other forms of cash payment (e.g., PayPal) to pay for Apps. If you are purchasing Synaptive Pro and PAID Apps via an online purchase, you can choose to purchase on a monthly or yearly subscription. You must provide Synaptive with a valid credit card or PayPal account, and you authorize Synaptive to charge the credit card or PayPal account for the recurring subscription, as per the auto renewal terms below. In addition, you agree that Synaptive has permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and payment processing firms (including any institutions or firms Synaptive retains in the future) your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase.
Subscription to Synaptive Pro and PAID Apps are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (as per the option you have chosen when you purchased Apps) and are non-refundable for the subscription period they are purchased for. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. Synaptive does not support all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel or downgrade your account, you authorize Synaptive to continue billing your credit card and/or PayPal account and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your obligation to pay fees continues through to the end of the subscription period during which you cancel your subscription. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.
4.3 Free Trial Period. If you sign up online for a Synaptive Pro or PAID app with a free initial trial period (the “Free Trial”), you must provide Synaptive with a valid credit card or PayPal account. If you do not cancel your account within the first 7 days after it was initially created, your credit card or PayPal account will automatically be billed starting on the first day after the Free Trial is over. If you cancel your account prior to the beginning of the 8th day, no charges will be put through your credit card or PayPal account. The Free Trial is only available to first time users of Synaptive’s Pro or PAID app.
4.4 Auto-renewal and Cancellation.
Synaptive Pro or PAID apps are for subscriptions that renew automatically, such as monthly or annually (depending on the option chosen when you purchased Apps). You agree that Synaptive may process your credit card or PayPal account on each monthly, annual, or other renewal term (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day corresponding to the first day you subscribed to a paid subscription. If your paid subscription to Synaptive Pro or PAID apps began on a day not contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on January 30 and there is no February 30), Synaptive will process your payment on the last day of such month. You may elect to cancel your Synaptive Pro or PAID apps at any time by clicking the “Cancel Subscription” button available in all of Synaptive’s Pro or PAID apps.
If you subscribed to a monthly plan, your Synaptive Pro or PAID app account will be immediately canceled, but no credit will be issued for any prepaid fees for your Synaptive Pro or PAID apps. If you subscribed to a yearly plan, any cancellation will only be effective at the end of the then-current annual billing period and no credits or refunds will be issued to you for prepaid fees.
4.5 Late Payment. If any amounts due hereunder are not received by Synaptive by the due date, then at Synaptive’s discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon 10 days' written notice, Synaptive may suspend your access to the Apps if Synaptive does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder at the expiration of such period.
4.6 Taxes and Withholdings. You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with the subscription to the Apps. If Synaptive has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this Section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide Synaptive with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions or withholdings, Synaptive receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
5. Term and Termination
