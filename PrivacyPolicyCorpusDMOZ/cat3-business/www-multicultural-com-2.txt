If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MMR OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES, PRINCIPALS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF MMR OR SUCH PERSON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) RESULTING FROM ANY ASPECT OF YOUR USE OF THE WEB SITE OR THE SOURCEBOOK, WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE WEB SITE OR THE SOURCEBOOK; YOUR INABILITY TO USE THE WEB SITE; THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION, ALTERATION, OR TERMINATION OF THE WEB SITE; ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN, OR STATEMENTS MADE, BY ANY USER WITH WHOM YOU COMMUNICATE OR CONSULT AS A RESULT OF SEEING AN EXPERT LISTING, SPEAKER PROFILE, OR ANY OTHER USER CONTENT ON THE WEB SITE OR IN THE SOURCE BOOK; OR OUT OF ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEB SITE OR THE SOURCE BOOK OR ANY LINKS ON THE WEB SITE.

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
