If we learn that we possess information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete such information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and other applicable laws. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at customerservice@troyleedesigns.com.     YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and certain other California privacy and data protection laws, you have the right to submit certain requests relating to your personal information, as described below.   Right to Know
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request more information regarding the following, to the extent applicable:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months.
The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected.
The business or commercial purpose why we collected or, if applicable, sold your personal information.
The categories of third parties with which we share personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
The categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months, and for each category, the categories of third parties to which we disclosed the information (if any).
A list of all third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information, as defined under California Civil Code Section 1798.83(e) (a/k/a the “Shine the Light Law”), during the preceding year for third-party direct marketing purposes.
You may submit a request for the information above by calling us at (800) 239-6566, emailing us, or submitting a completed form available here.  In connection with submission of your request, we will take steps to verify your identity as outlined below, and you will need to verify your identity before action is taken.
Please note that due to the different requirements of the applicable laws, our response times may vary depending on the specific type(s) of information sought.  We respond to all verifiable requests for information as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required.
Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
Subject to certain exceptions, and upon your submission of a verifiable request, California residents have the right to deletion of their personal information from our records, and to have us direct our service providers delete your personal information from their records.   Once we receive your request, we will let you know what, if any, personal information we can delete from our records, and we will direct any service providers that may have collected personal information about you through our website to delete your personal information from their records. There may be circumstances where we cannot delete your personal information or direct service providers to delete your personal information from their records.  For example, if we need to: (1) retain your personal information to complete a transaction or provide services; (2) detect security incidents; (3) protect against unlawful activities; (4) identify, debug or repair errors; or (5) comply with a legal obligation. You may submit a request to delete your personal information by calling us at [insert toll free telephone number], emailing us at [insert email address], or submitting a completed form available here [insert link to web form]. In connection with submission of your request, we will take steps to verify your identity as outlined below, and you will need to verify your identity before action is taken.   Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Your Personal Information California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. Although we do not sell your personal information to third parties for money, we do engage in activities—such as targeted advertising—that could be considered a “sale” under California law. To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, visit our homepage and click here, call us at 800-239-6566 or email us here.  Verification of Requests for Further Information or to Delete Personal Information Please note that when submitting a request to know or a request to delete information, you will be asked to provide information to verify your identity before action is taken. Verification is required in order to confirm that the person submitting the request to know or request to delete is the person to whom the information relates, and to prevent unauthorized access or deletion of information. The specific steps taken to verify the identity of the requesting person may vary based on the nature of the request, including the type, sensitivity and value of the information requested, the risk of harm posed by unauthorized access or deletion, the likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors may seek the information, the robustness of personal information provided to verify your identity, the nature of our business relationship with you, and available technology for verification.  We will generally try to avoid requesting additional information from you for the purpose of verification, but we may need to do so if we cannot verify your identity based on the information already maintained by us. If we request additional information to verify your identity, it will be for that purpose only, and will be deleted as soon as practical after processing the request, except as otherwise provided by law. You may designate an authorized agent to make the requests below on your behalf. An authorized agent must submit proof to us that he or she has been authorized by you to act on your behalf, and you will need to verify your identity directly with us through the process described below. The following generally describes the verification processes we use:
Password Protected Accounts. If you have a password-protected account with us, we may use existing authentication practices to verify your identity, but will require re-authentication before disclosing or deleting data. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity relating to your account, we will require further verification (as described below) before complying with a request to know or delete.
Verification for Non-Accountholders. If you do not have, or cannot access, a password-protected account with us, we will generally verify your identity as follows:
For requests to know categories of personal information, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty by matching at least two data points provided by you with reliable data points maintained by us.
For requests to know specific pieces of personal information, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty by matching at least three data points provided by you with reliable data points maintained by us. We will also require a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, that the person requesting the information is the person whose information is the subject of the request or that person’s authorized representative. We will maintain all signed declarations as part of our records.
For requests to delete personal information, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree or a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm posed by unauthorized deletion. We will act in good faith when determining the appropriate standard to apply.
If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity, we will state so in response to a request to know or delete personal information, including an explanation of why we have no reasonable method to verify your identity.
Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights
If you choose to exercise any of the privacy rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, you also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us. This means that, consistent with California law, we will not deny providing our products or Services to you, charge you different prices or provide a different level or quality of products or Services to you unless those differences are related to the value of your personal information.
Nevada Privacy Notice
Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt-out of the “sale” of “covered information” to third parties, as defined by Nevada law, including but not limited to name, address, social security number, and online service activity. Our uses of your personal information are not sales under Nevada law, so no opt-out is required.
INFORMATION SECURITY
The security of your personal information is important to us. We take commercially reasonable and appropriate safeguards to secure and protect the privacy, accuracy, and reliability of your information and to protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or databases. Nor can we guarantee that the personal information we collect about you will not be breached, intercepted, destroyed, or accessed without authorization.
Please do your part to help us keep your information secure by choosing passwords carefully, keeping your password and computer secure (such as by signing out after using the Services), and changing your password from time to time.
INFORMATION STORAGE
We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide our Services to you, to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements.
EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS
You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found in every  marketing email we send, or (if you have an account with us) by logging into your account and changing your preferences, or by sending us a request to unsubscribe here. If you opt-out of receiving marketing email communications, we may still send you email messages related to your account with us, including specific transactions or our services. Unsubscribing yourself from our marketing communications will not affect our service to you.
TEXT MESSAGING
You have the choice to opt-in to receiving text messages and alerts on the mobile phone number(s) you have shared with us. Once you have opted-in, we may send you text messages (i) regarding your account; (ii) to investigate or prevent fraud; and (iii) to alert you in the event of an emergency. We may send you text messages and alerts using autodialed technology. We will not contact you via text messages or alerts for marketing purposes without your prior express written consent. You do not have to opt-in to text messages and alerts to use and enjoy our website and Services. If you opt-in, standard text messaging charges may apply. For more information regarding our text messaging and alerts, please contact us here or call 1-800-239-6566.
You may choose to opt-out from our text messages and alerts at any time using any reasonable means. To directly opt-out, send us a text message from your mobile phone with the word STOP, STOP ALL, END, QUIT, CANCEL or UNSUBSCRIBE, and we will unsubscribe you from text communications. Once you opt-out, you will not receive any additional text messages via your mobile phone. Please keep in mind that if you opt-out of receiving text messages and alerts we may not be able to contact you with important messages regarding your account. However, if there is an emergency or account question, we will make every attempt to contact you in other ways, such as by email or on a landline phone.
DO NOT TRACK
We do not currently have the technology to automatically respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals sent by web browsers, mobile devices, or other mechanisms. You also may limit certain tracking by disabling cookies in your web browser. If you are a California resident who wishes to delete your personal information or opt out of the sale of you personal information, please see the instructions for submitting such requests, above.
LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES
Our websites and apps may contain links to other websites or apps. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites or apps. You should read the privacy statements of these other websites or apps to understand their policies and practices.
PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES
We may update this Policy from time to time, in our sole discretion to reflect our current privacy practices. When we do so, we will post the new Policy on our website, and email existing customers at the email addresses associated with their accounts. Our use of personal information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is provided or collected. You should consult this Policy regularly for any changes. Continued use of our Services following the effective date of any modification to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the changes.

WHAT’S NEW
Effective January, 2020, we changed our Privacy Policy to clarify the types of information we collect about you, the ways we collect your information, and how we use and share your information. We also added a section to our Privacy Policy that explains the rights of California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Finally, we re-formatted our Privacy Policy to make it easier to read, and better enable you to find the information you are looking for.
Our Privacy Policy is now divided into many short sections so that you can quickly find what you need:
