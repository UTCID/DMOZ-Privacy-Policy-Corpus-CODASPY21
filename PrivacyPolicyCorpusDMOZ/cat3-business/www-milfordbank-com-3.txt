In the normal course of our business, we may request or receive social security numbers from customers, employees, job applicants and others. At The Milford Bank, we are concerned about privacy and appreciate the fact that social security numbers deserve special protections. As a result, we have policies and procedures which are designed to: (1) protect the confidentiality of social security numbers, (2) prohibit unlawful disclosure of social security numbers, and (3) limit access to social security numbers.
