To better ensure our users’ privacy protection, we have disabled the interest-based ads that rely on information related to the users’ personal preferences and/or previous navigation.
Our ads are purely contextual, which means that they depend exclusively on the topic of the various pages and on a limited set of information about the users – such as country of origin, language and or type of device. These are generic, anonymized data that cannot be considered as PII (personal identifiable information).
However for statistical purposes the data collected by Google Analytics could be linked with the data collected by Google AdSense and/or DoubleClick for Publishers, which could potentially enable the user’s identification
