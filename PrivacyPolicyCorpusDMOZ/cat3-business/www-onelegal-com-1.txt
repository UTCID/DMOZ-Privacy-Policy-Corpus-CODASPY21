Privacy PolicyLast modified: January 8, 2020
One Legal is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy covers One Legal’s treatment of the personal information we collect from and about you. This policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access, update, or delete this data.
1. Personal information we collect about you and how we use itThe table in Annex 1 sets out the categories of personal information we have collected about you over the past 12 months. The sources of this information and the purposes for collecting it are set forth further below.1.1. Information you give to us: We collect personal information about you when you voluntarily submit information directly to us by filling in forms on our website or by corresponding with us by phone, email, or otherwise. Personal information is data that identifies or is associated with you and includes information you provide when you register to use our website, use the One Legal platform, enter a competition, promotion, or survey, report a problem with our website, or use some other feature of the One Legal service.1.2. Information we receive from other sources:  We work with third parties (including, for example, subcontractors in technical, payment, and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, and credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them, subject to your agreements with them.1.3. We automatically collect personal information about you indirectly about how you access and use the One Legal service and information about the device you use to access the One Legal service. This information includes device ID or unique identifier, device type, geolocation info, and computer and connection information. We also collect personal information using cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, which provide information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take on our services within our advertising or e-mail content. The table in Annex 2 sets out the categories of personal information we collect automatically.1.4. We may supplement the personal information we collect with information from third parties and add it to your account information. For example, we may collect and use demographic information that is publicly available, additional contact information, credit check information, and information from credit bureaus, as allowed by applicable national laws.1.5. We may link or combine the personal information we collect and/or receive about you and the information we collect automatically. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us.1.6. We may anonymize and aggregate any of the personal information we collect (so that you are not personally identified). We may use anonymized information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving the One Legal service, and developing new products and features. We may also share such anonymized information with others. 2. Disclosure of your personal information2.1. We do not sell your personal information. We share your personal information with third parties only as follows:2.1.1. If you request it or to complete a transaction initiated by you (See annex 1 for details);2.1.2.

We may share your personal information while negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate control, such as a restructuring, merger, or sale of our assets.2.2. Over the past 12 months we have not sold your personal information. We have disclosed your information for a business purpose as set forth in Annex 1.2.3. If, in the future, we need to share your personal information for any other purpose, you will be informed in advance and have the opportunity to opt-out.2.4. Publicly accessible blogs. Our website includes publicly accessible blogs or community forums.

These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies. Analytics and targeting cookies are used to monitor performance and improve our website, understand how you use our products and services, serve ads, and remarket products and services to you. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand how our website, services, and products perform and how you use them.

You will continue to receive generic ads.7.5. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our site.7.6. Social Media. Our website includes social media features, such as Facebook Like button and widgets such as the Share button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

The fact that we may send notices to you will not stop you from being able to opt-out of certain types of contact, as described in this privacy policy.12. California do not track notice12.1. Because there are not yet common, industry accepted “do not track” standards and systems, our website does not respond to Do Not Track signals.
