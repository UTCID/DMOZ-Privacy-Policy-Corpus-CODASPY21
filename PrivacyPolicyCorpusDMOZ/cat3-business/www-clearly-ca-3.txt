Thank you for visiting Clearly.ca, an Essilor Group Canada Inc. website (the "Site"). Clearly is a leading online retail store and information site for contact lenses, glasses, and related products. The Site is designed by us, Clearly, ("we" and "us") a company with limited liability situated in and vested under the laws of the British Columbia, to provide a convenient, private and informative shopping experience for consumers to purchase contact lenses and related products 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We offer a large selection of contact lenses, glasses, and related products, along with a wealth of information designed to help consumers make educated purchasing decisions. We want each visitor to the Site ("you") (i.e. any natural person acting on the Site with purposes having no relationship to his/her commercial or professional activity) to have a safe, pleasurable visit, so we have established the following general terms and conditions so that we (we and you) know what to expect from each other.
These general terms and conditions (which include the returns policy, intellectual property policy and privacy policy) are applicable to any use of the Site and to any agreements concluded between you and us through the Site. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions, you cannot use this Site and/or buy any products or services through this Site. We may make changes to the Site, these Terms and Conditions of Use, or the policies and conditions that govern the use of the Site at any time. We encourage you to review the Site and the General Terms and Conditions periodically for any updates or changes. Your continued access or use of the Site shall be deemed to be your acceptance of these changes and of the reasonableness of these standards for notice of changes.

In consideration of your use of the Site, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the checkout form for your account information (the "Account Information") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Account Information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current and future use of the Site. Account Information and certain other information about you are subject to our Privacy Policy. Please review our privacy policy to understand our privacy related practices.
Your Conduct
Any conduct by you that in our sole discretion restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying the Site will not be permitted. You agree to use the Site only for lawful purposes. You are prohibited from posting on or transmitting through the Site any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, profane, hateful, fraudulent, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any kind, including but not limited to any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law.
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Site, use of the Site, or access to the Site unless you first obtain our express written consent to do so. You agree not to access the Site by any means other than through the interface that is provided by us for use in accessing the Site.
Valid prescription required
You hereby certify that you have a valid prescription for the contact lenses or eyeglasses that you are ordering. You represent and warrant to Clearly by placing an order that your information you enter into the Site is valid and true and matches exactly your prescription as provided by your eye care provider. You further certify that you will renew your prescription in strict accordance with your eye care providers suggested regime. You understand that we will not fulfill your order unless you have a valid prescription. You hereby consent to our contacting your eye care provider, or providing a copy of your original prescription to us, if necessary, to verify your prescription information and any other necessary information.
Color and product description
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear at the Site. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate. We have attempted to be as accurate as possible. However, we do not warrant that the product descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by the Site is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
Delivery
Deliveries will be as soon as possible to the address on your order and are "best effort" based. Subject to delays outside our control, the overall delivery period will not exceed 30 days.
From time to time, we will send samples of product, including, but not limited to, contact lens solutions.
Cooling-off period
You may return any products ordered by you and cancel the agreement without stating any reason for doing so, such within seven (7) working days following the confirmation of your order ("the Return Period"). If you return the products you are obliged to comply with the requirement of our Returns Policy (below). You must return all the products in the resalable packaging provided with them. Between the date of your election to withdraw and the date the product is returned by you to us you shall bear all risk in keeping the products safe, secure, and free from loss or damage.
Returns & Exchanges
Return policy extended:
Due to the current challenges of COVID-19, we’ve temporarily extended our return policy to 60 days from the date of delivery.
We offer a 60 day return policy on prescription glasses and sunglasses, and a 60 day return policy on contact lenses, as well as a 365 day warranty on eyewear, from your delivery date. We provide free returns on all of our products during these time periods. To make a return, simply call us within the stated days for a complimentary electronic shipping label that you can print off. Once you have the label, we ask that you ship your glasses back to us as soon as possible to initiate your refund.
Looking for an exchange? We want to help you find your perfect pair of glasses. Our Vision Ambassadors can walk you through finding the best fit, style, and prescription correction.
Glasses and sunglasses must be returned in their original unused and unworn condition. Contact lenses must be returned in unopened, unmarked boxes and must be within 6 months of their expiry date. Returns or exchanges may be denied, in very rare circumstances, based on the nature of prior transactions.
Service credits
All service credits are issued to your MyAccount and will be valid for 3 months from the date of issue, unless otherwise stated. To use the credit, ensure you are logged into your MyAccount prior to placing your order. Your credit will automatically be deducted from your total at checkout. Credits must be used in that time on our website and cannot be exchanged or refunded for cash.
Warranty
We guarantee the quality of our frames, glasses lenses, and coatings. If you experience a manufacturing defect within 365 days of delivery, simply contact our Vision Care Department for a free return label to facilitate a replacement or exchange. Our warranty does not cover the damage caused by the wear and tear of everyday use, or the damaged caused by sudden force or impact.

Eyeglasses Policy
Shipping and Payment
Glasses
Production times for prescription lenses vary in business days depending on the intricacy of the prescription and the type of lens required. Once your lenses have been crafted and mounted into the frame, they will be shipped to you using your chosen shipping method.
Contact lenses
Your wait time depends on your lens type. Some products are in stock, and others — including toric/astigmatism, RGP, and multifocal lenses — are custom orders through the manufacturer. Production times are listed on product pages under the heading "Availability."
Once your contact lenses are in stock, they should be shipped within 1–2 business days and will arrive within the time estimate provided by your chosen shipping method.
When your order ships, you will be sent an email confirmation that includes a tracking number and instructions for how to track your order online.
Please keep in mind that quality assurance technicians inspect and verify each and every eyeglass order. If your eyeglasses happen to fail quality assurance, your expected delivery time will be delayed. You will be kept up-to-date of any delays via email.
For FAQ’s on shipments please visit our FAQ’s
If using a coupon code, please note that only one coupon code can be used per order. We accept the following forms of payment: Visa, Mastercard, Amex or PayPal. Payments can be made online or by phone.
NOTE: The title and risk and rewards of ownership of the product transfers from Clearly (Essilor Group Canada Inc.) to the customer at the point of shipment.
Prescription
When you are fitted for eyeglasses by your Eye Care Practitioner, they should provide you with a paper copy of your prescription. Keep in mind that spectacle and contact lens prescriptions can be different, so you should ensure that you are ordering the parameters for your glasses and not for your contact lenses.
