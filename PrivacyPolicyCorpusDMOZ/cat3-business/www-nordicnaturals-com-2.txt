You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that are applicable to certain services on the Website. The Terms and the Privacy Policy do not alter the terms and conditions of any other written or online agreement between you and Nordic Naturals. The failure of Nordic Naturals to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms or this Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Terms of Use shall be found by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity of the remaining Terms. You may not assign the Terms or any of your rights or obligations under the Terms without Nordic Naturals’ express written consent. The Terms inure to the benefit of Nordic Naturals’ successors, assigns and licensees. The section titles in this Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

Governing Law and Venue for Resolving Disputes
This Terms of Use shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law principles. Those who choose to access the Website from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable, including without limitation, all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside (if different from the United States).

Binding Arbitration
Arbitration Procedures. You and Nordic Naturals agree that, except as provided in Paragraph 4 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this Terms of Use, the Terms or your use of this Website (each a “Claim”), will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of AAA that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “AAA Rules”) and under the terms set forth in this Terms of Use. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Binding Arbitration Section and the AAA Rules, the terms in this Binding Arbitration Section will control and prevail.
Except as otherwise set forth in Paragraph 4 below, you may seek any non-injunctive remedies available to you under state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Terms of Use, (i) you and Nordic Naturals may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision will be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND NORDIC NATURALS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
Location. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Cruz County, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.
Limitations. You and Nordic Naturals agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Nordic Naturals and you individually. YOU AND NORDIC NATURALS AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION WILL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
Arbitration Fees. The party seeking the Claim is responsible for the initial fees to AAA. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules.
Severability. You and Nordic Naturals agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable, except any portion of Paragraph 4, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the Paragraph will be given full force and effect. If Paragraph 4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither you nor Nordic Naturals will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim will be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Santa Cruz County, CA and you and Nordic Naturals agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS TERMS OF USE OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE NORDIC REWARDS PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR PARTICIPATE IN THE NORDIC REWARDS PROGRAM.
These Nordic Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (“Rewards Terms” or “Terms”) apply to your access to and participation in the Nordic Rewards Program (“Rewards Program” or “Nordic Rewards”), which is operated by Nordic Naturals, Inc.. These Rewards Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Nordic Naturals for other products and services. Please note that your access to and participation in the Rewards Program is also governed by the terms, conditions, limitations and requirements linked in these Rewards Terms, all of which (as may be changed over time) are incorporated into these Rewards Terms.
Nordic Naturals reserves the right to change, modify and/or eliminate the Rewards Program and/or all or any portion of these Rewards Terms or any policy pertaining to the Rewards Program at any time and in our sole discretion, including our right to discontinue or change the benefits or change the expiration date of rewards points (defined below) received under the Rewards Program, merge the Rewards Program with another rewards program, or to adjust how rewards points are earned, calculated or redeemed. If we make changes, we will post the amended Rewards Terms to www.nordicnaturals.com/consumers/reward-points and update the effective date above. We may also attempt to notify you in other ways. Unless we say otherwise, the amended Rewards Terms will be effective immediately and your continued participation in the Rewards Program after the amended terms are posted will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Rewards Terms, you must stop participating in the Rewards Program.
1. Rewards Program Eligibility
You must be a United States resident (including residents of U.S. Territories) who is at least 18 years of age to participate in the Rewards Program. The Rewards Program is intended for personal use only, and commercial use by commercial customers and others purchasing items for resale are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program. Current Nordic Naturals employees and contractors are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.
2. Privacy
Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your visit to the NordicNaturals.com website, to understand our practices.
3. Rewards Program Description
The Rewards Program is a free customer loyalty program that allows participants to earn rewards points with qualifying purchases on NordicNaturals.com. Participants may also earn rewards points by participating in promotional activities that may be offered through the Rewards Program from time to time.
Participants in the Rewards Program may redeem accumulated rewards points for discounts on purchases made on Nordicnaturals.com. These Rewards Terms provide a general overview of the Rewards Program.
4. Joining the Nordic Rewards Program
There are no membership fees associated with the Rewards Program. You will enroll in the Rewards Program when you create an account on the Nordic Naturals website. The enrollment form requires that you provide your first name, last name, e-mail address and create a password.
You may only have one Rewards Program account, and it is nontransferable. You are responsible for anyone else who uses your Rewards Program account.
5. Earning Rewards Points
As a member of the Nordic Rewards program you will receive 1 point per $1 spent on qualifying purchases (10% back), and 2 points per $1 spent on auto-ship purchases (20% back). To earn points, you must be logged in to your Rewards Program account. Qualifying purchases include regular and sale priced products purchased at Nordicnaturals.com. Certain purchases may not qualify for accrual of rewards points, including but not limited to shipping fees, sales tax, and any purchase made with rewards points. Customers may also be eligible to receive bonus rewards points for specified promotional offers advertised from time to time by Nordic Naturals at the sole discretion of Nordic Naturals. The details of such bonus rewards points will be provided at the time the offer is made.
The Nordic Rewards points structure, including any bonus rewards points, is subject, at Nordic Naturals's sole discretion, to modification or limitation at any time, including, without limitation, the right to establish additional means of accruing rewards points, the right to modify and delete any or all of the recognized means of accruing rewards points, their values and types, and the rewards points redemption terms, and the right to exclude specific types of transactions from reward point eligibility.
Nordic Rewards points are accrued after customers make a purchase on Nordicnaturals.com once payment has posted. Only the individual named as the primary account holder may accrue rewards points for qualifying purchases.
For returned merchandise, if a customer has paid with rewards points, the refund will be provided as rewards points. For purchases made with both rewards points and a credit card, customers will receive a refund in the same combination used at the time of payment. If you void a purchase or return your purchase, Nordic Naturals will deduct the rewards points that you were awarded for that purchase from your rewards program account. If you have already redeemed those rewards points, this could potentially result in a negative rewards point balance in your rewards program account.
A summary of a customer's Nordic Naturals account may be obtained by visiting Nordicnaturals.com. Nordic Naturals will attempt to credit customers' accounts with rewards points on a timely basis. However, each customer shall have the responsibility of ensuring that his or her rewards points are properly credited. Any claim for rewards points not credited accurately must be received by Nordic Naturals within thirty (30) days of the date of claimed accrual of such rewards points, or else such rewards points will no longer be valid or usable. Nordic Naturals shall have no liability for any printing, production, typographical, mechanical, or other errors in offering or awarding rewards points, for any delay or failure to credit rewards points to accounts, or for any failure to provide account summaries as outlined herein.
6. Redemption of Rewards Points
Once a customer has accrued any rewards points in his or her account, the customer may apply the rewards points as a discount on any purchase on Nordicnaturals.com. A customer may redeem any amount of earned rewards points on any purchase on the Nordic Naturals website. Rewards points can be redeemed in whole or in part for purchases made on Nordicnaturals.com.
No cash will be exchanged for the unused portion of any customer's rewards points. Once rewards points have been redeemed, they are no longer valid for any subsequent redemption and they may not be returned or refunded to a customer's account for any reason except for a refund of purchase using rewards points.
7. Expiration of Rewards Points
Rewards points will expire 18 months from the date they were earned.
8. Miscellaneous
Nordic Naturals reserves the right to invalidate rewards points from a customer's account with notice if it determines, in its sole discretion that such rewards points were improperly credited to such customer's account or were obtained fraudulently or otherwise in violation of these Terms. Nordic Naturals reserves the right to require proof of accrual of rewards points and the right to delay the processing or redemption of any rewards points without notice, in order to assure compliance with these Terms.
Without limiting any other remedies, Nordic Naturals may suspend or terminate any account if Nordic Naturals suspects, in its sole discretion that any customer or other person has engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with the Rewards Program. Rewards points do not constitute property, do not entitle a customer to a vested right or interest and have no cash value. As such, rewards points are not redeemable for cash, transferable, or assignable for any reason. The sale, barter, transfer or assignment of any accumulated rewards points, other than by Nordic Naturals, is strictly prohibited.
