Restrictions on Use of the Sites
You agree that you will not post material on the Sites, or otherwise use the Sites or Content in any manner, that could: (i) humiliate, threaten, defame, harass, or injure other people or their property rights, including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights; (ii) violate the privacy or publicity rights of other individuals or entities; (iii) be considered criminal conduct or give rise to civil liability; or (iv) otherwise violate any law or regulation or these Terms. You further understand and agree that posting unsolicited advertisements on the Sites is expressly prohibited by these Terms.
You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Sites for any purpose without our express written permission. Additionally, you agree that you will not: (i) take any action that imposes, or may impose in our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the site or any activities conducted on the Sites; or (iii) bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Sites.
Any unauthorized use of our Sites or computer systems is a violation of these Terms. In addition to any remedies that we may have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions, we may take any action we deem necessary to prevent or cure the violation, including without limitation, the immediate termination of your access to the Sites.
Unsolicited Submissions
Guardian does not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested. This policy is designed to avoid misunderstandings if projects developed by Guardian’s professional staff seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, Guardian requests that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials except where specifically requested or solicited.
However, if you do send us any unsolicited suggestions, (i) you agree not to assert any ownership right of any kind in against Guardian (including, but not limited to copyright, trademark, unfair competition, moral rights, or implied contract), (ii) you hereby grant Guardian a nonexclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to use the unsolicited submission in every media and for every purpose now known or hereinafter discovered, and (iii) you waive the right to receive any financial or other consideration in connection with such unsolicited submission including, but not limited to, credit. You agree to release Guardian (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any claims, demands, or damages (actual and consequential) arising out of, or in any way connected with, your unsolicited submissions, including, without limitation, all claims for theft of ideas or copyright infringement.
Links
Running or displaying the Sites or any Content displayed on the Sites in frames or through similar means on another site without our prior written permission is prohibited.
From time to time, the Sites may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned, operated or controlled by Guardian.  All such links are provided solely as a convenience to you.  We are not responsible for any content, materials or other information located on or accessible from any other websites.  Nor do we endorse, guarantee, or make any representations or warranties regarding any other websites, or any content, materials or other information located or accessible from those websites.  If you decide to access any other websites linked to or from the Sites, you do so entirely at your own risk.
Availability of Products and Services; United States Only
Certain products and services offered by Guardian through the Sites may not be available in all areas of the United States (“U.S”), and you may not be eligible for all products and services.  Guardian reserves the exclusive right to determine availability and eligibility for our products and services.
The Sites are directed to and are intended to be made available only to persons in the United States and are not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person in any other country or any jurisdiction where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or that would subject Guardian to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Persons who access the Sites do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. Software and other materials from Sites may be subject to export controls imposed by the United States and may not be downloaded or otherwise exported to any country or anyone prohibited by law. Guardian prohibits your downloading or exporting of software or other material from the Sites in violation of U.S. export laws and any applicable international or foreign laws, including the laws of your resident country. By downloading software or other material from the Sites, you represent and warrant that you are able to do so in full compliance with the laws of the United States and all applicable international and foreign laws, including the laws of your resident country.
Limitations of Liability
FOR PURPOSES OF THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION, “GUARDIAN” REFERS TO THE GUARDIAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, INCLUDING ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS.
YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT A CLAIM AGAINST GUARDIAN MORE THAN TWELVE (12) MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST EVENT OR FACT THAT GIVES RISE TO THE CLAIM.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT SHALL GUARDIAN BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OR RESULTING FROM ANY INTERRUPTION IN OR DISRUPTION TO THE SITES OR CONTENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL GUARDIAN BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES), REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER GUARDIAN WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN NO EVENT SHALL GUARDIAN’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (1) $2,500; OR (2) THREE (3) TIMES THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO GUARDIAN PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY TO INJURIES: (1) TO THE BODY OR PERSON; OR (2) CAUSED BY GUARDIAN’S WILLFUL, MALICIOUS, RECKLESS, OR GROSSLY NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS.
THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.  BECAUSE THE LAW REGARDING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY VARIES BY STATE, THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
NOTICE TO NEW JERSEY CONSUMERS: THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY IN NEW JERSEY.
THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY WHETHER THE ASSERTED LIABILITY OR DAMAGES ARE BASED IN CONTRACT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF WARRANTY), TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE GROUNDS. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITES IS TO STOP USING THE SITES.
IF THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE HELD TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, YOU AGREE THAT GUARDIAN'S LIABILITY TO YOU, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ALL CAUSES SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $500.
Indemnity and Release
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Guardian, each of our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates and the successors of each of the foregoing, and the officers, directors, agents, and employees of each of the foregoing, harmless from any and all liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, related to or in connection with (i) your use of the Sites or Content; (ii) your violation of any term or condition of these Terms, including without limitation, your breach of any of the representations and warranties; (iii) your violation of any third party rights, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any law, rule or regulation of the United States or any other country; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any information or material that you provide to Guardian; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of the Sites with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.
In the event that you have a dispute with another user or party related to the Sites or Content, you release Guardian (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
Termination
We may suspend or terminate your account or your access to the Sites at any time without notice, for any reason or for no reason. You understand that any termination of your account may involve the permanent deletion of your data.  Guardian will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of your data. The provisions of these Terms regarding Restrictions on Use of the Sites, Intellectual Property Rights and Ownership, Unsolicited Submissions, Warranty Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Indemnity and Release, Severability and Interpretation, and Governing Law shall survive any termination.
Severability and Interpretation
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. You agree that these Terms and all incorporated agreements may be assigned by Guardian in our sole discretion. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.  Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.  A printed version of these Terms will be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent as other business documents originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Governing Law
Any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Sites and Content shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law provisions. You expressly agree to submit any disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, New York.
Binding Arbitration
a. Purpose.  Any Dispute (as defined below in these Terms) involving you and Guardian shall be resolved through individual arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court. This Section (the “Arbitration Provision”) shall be broadly interpreted.
b. Definitions. The term “Dispute” means any claim or controversy related to the Sites, including but not limited to any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the expiration or termination of these Terms; and (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. As used in this Arbitration Provision, "Guardian" means Guardian Life and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and “you” means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Disputes relating to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this arbitration provision will not be subject to arbitration.
c. Right to Sue in Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision, either party may elect to bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.
d. Right to Opt Out. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES YOU MAY DECLINE TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTES WITH GUARDIAN ARBITRATED BY NOTIFYING GUARDIAN IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE LATER OF YOUR FIRST ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITES, BY MAIL TO GUARDIAN, ATTN; PRIVACY OFFICE, LAW AND COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT, 10 HUDSON YARDS, NEW YORK, NY 10001. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO GUARDIAN MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND TELEPHONE NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH GUARDIAN THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GUARDIAN OR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY GUARDIAN.
e. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll free number (1-800-778-7879). You may deliver any required or desired notice to Guardian by mail to Guardian Life, Attn: Privacy Office, Law and Compliance Department, 10 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001.
f. Arbitration Procedures. This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify Guardian about your Dispute. You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the AAA rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If the AAA will not administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written applying the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Guardian agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the area where you receive or received any of the Sites from Guardian; or, if you reside in a location outside of the area where you receive or received any of the Sites, then the arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the county where you reside. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator’s essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator’s award. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
g. Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT. THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
h. Arbitration Fees and Costs. If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be governed by the AAA rules. If your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs will be Guardian’s responsibility. However, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the AAA’s fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules and you shall reimburse Guardian for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, Guardian will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.
i. Continuation. This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.
General Legal Terms
The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Guardian and govern your use of the Sites, and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Guardian in relation to the Sites. No modification or attempted modification of these Terms by you shall be binding on Guardian unless made in writing and physically signed by an authorized representative of Guardian.
WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, Guardian and its third party service providers reserve the right to delete all your data, files, electronic messages, or other information that is stored on Guardian’s or its third party service providers’ servers or systems. Guardian shall have no responsibility whatsoever for the loss of any such data.
You agree that Guardian may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Sites.
You agree that if Guardian does not exercise or enforce any contractual or legal right or remedy to which it is entitled, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Guardian’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Guardian.
You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Guardian is the parent shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms and that these other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than these entities, and the entities described in the Apple Disclaimer above, no other person or entity shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms.
