Privacy Policy
At Synergy International, we have invested heavily into protecting our customer’s data and privacy. Over the years we have used various types of encryption methods to make sure that confidential information stays confidential.
Our website is largely informational and we do not use it to collect personal information. We do not share or sell information about our customers, whether obtained in person or electronically, with any outside groups other than those working directly on our behalf (such as a mailing house).
We do not offer the opportunity to purchase items through our website, therefore, the only information you supply would be basic contact information (i.e., name, address, etc.). This information will primarily be used to process for correspondence, and may also be used to make other information about Synergy International’s products and/or services available to you via e-mail or regular mail.
In order to facilitate operation of our website, we may also utilize “cookies,” which are a standard and non-personally identifiable feature found in browser software. Cookies are small electronic files assigned to each website visitor as an anonymous form of identification. They cannot be used to identify individual people – just the computers used by those people. Cookies allow us to determine which pages of our website are being visited and how users are interacting with them. You always have the option of setting your browser not to accept cookies, although that may limit your ability to take full advantage of our site.
Like most websites, our Web servers also automatically collect limited information about your computer’s connection to the Internet (such as your IP address). This again is not linkable to an individual.
Refund Policy
Customer satisfaction is our number one goal. If you are unhappy for any reason please do not hesitate to contact our office and we will do our best to correct the problem.
