Privacy Policy
Medical Education Resources and Quantum Medical Education maintain high standards for the protection of privacy over the Internet. The purpose of this statement is to explain what information we obtain, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure.
The only information MER obtains is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor.
We do not sell or disclose individually identifiable information obtained online unless it is required by law or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees, or property.
We use the information to grade your posttest and to send you a certificate of completion of the activity. If we use a third-party company to grade your posttest and issue certificates of completion, we will give the information to that company for that purpose only.
For each activity that you take, you must complete an evaluation questionnaire. That questionnaire asks if you are willing to participate in a follow-up survey. If you answer yes, we will use your name and contact information to send you the survey.
We may use the information to invite you to participate in other activities that we may offer.
Medical Education Resources is committed to safeguarding customer privacy, and we require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers. Should you wish to delete your information from our files or discuss our privacy policy, please contact us.
