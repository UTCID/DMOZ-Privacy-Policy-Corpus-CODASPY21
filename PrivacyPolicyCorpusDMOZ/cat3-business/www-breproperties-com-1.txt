3. Acceptable Use of the Web Site and Services
You are responsible for your use of the Web Site and Services, and for any use of the Web Site or Services made using your account. Our goal is to create a positive, useful, and safe user experience. To promote this goal, we prohibit certain kinds of conduct that may be harmful to other users or to us. By way of example, you may not use the Web Site or Services to:
violate any law or regulation;
violate, infringe, or misappropriate other people's intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other legal rights;
engage in spidering or harvesting, or participate in the use of software, including spyware, designed to collect data from the Web Site or Services;

attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any of the software or other underlying code used to provide the Web Site or Services; or
advocate, encourage, or assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.
4. Equal Housing Opportunity
Essex communities are equal housing opportunities. Essex is committed to the letter and spirit of all fair housing laws. Essex does not discriminate in its housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law.
5. Ownership
We own or license all right, title, and interest in and to (a) the Web Site and Services, including all software, text, media, and other content available on the Web Site and Services ("Our Content"); and (b) our trademarks, logos, and brand elements ("Marks"). The Web Site and Services, Our Content, and Marks are all protected under U.S. and international laws. Except as stated in these Terms and Conditions, no content may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, including without limitation, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise without Essex's prior written consent.
You agree to grant Essex a non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide, and perpetual right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense, display, transmit, publish, and otherwise use in any manner all or any portion of any material or information you post or submit to us (on or via the Web Site, or by means other than the Web Site, including without limitation via our social media pages and accounts such as Facebook and Twitter), and derivative works thereof, for any purpose whatsoever.
6. Third-Party Portals
Essex works with third-party web site operators to provide services such as online rental applications, resident services, and investor relations information ("Portal Sites"). Essex's Portal Sites may utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Web Site when the user is actually on a Portal Site. For example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of www.essexapartmenthomes.com, but the URL listed in your browser is a different URL than www.essexapartmenthomes.com, then know that any information you provide is being collected by this third party and may not be governed by these Terms and Conditions. Among other things, the option to pay rent electronically may be made available by a third-party using a Portal Site. Electronic payments are governed by the Portal Site's terms and conditions. Essex is not responsible for ensuring the uptime or functionality of any such service and if the electronic payment is not successful for any reason, then the tenant should use an alternative method of payment.
When you leave the Web Site and are transferred to a Portal Site, you will be notified that you are no longer on the Essex Web Site. You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of use for any Portal Site before using a Portal Site.
Please note that the information you provide to any Portal Site may be shared with Essex. For information on how Essex uses your Personal Information, we encourage you to review the Essex Privacy Policy.
7. User Interactions
The Web Site may contain features that link you or provide you with access to third-party services and content that are completely independent of Essex. For example, Yardi hosts and maintains the Resident Portal. Essex uses the Resident Portal to process payments, and you may interact directly with others through the Interactive Areas of the Resident Portal. Your interactions with organizations or individuals found on or through the Site are solely between you and such organizations or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any interaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Essex is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind or nature incurred as the result of any of these dealings. If there is a dispute between users of the Web Site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that our Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with any other user of the Web Site, you hereby release Essex and its affiliates, and their officers, employees, directors, shareholders, agents, and successors ("Affiliates") from any claims, demands, costs, liabilities, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes or the Web Site. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH PROVIDES: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.
8. Contact with Essex
By registering on this Web Site and providing your contact information, you (a) agree that your registration constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws, and (b) consent to receive calls, text messages (including SMS and MMS messages), and other electronic messages (including those made using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice) from us and from our affiliated entities at any phone number, email address, or other telephonic or electronic form of contact you provided, including your home, work, cellular, or other telephone number, even if that number is registered on a corporate, state, or National Do Not Call Registry. You also understand and agree that your consent to such calls, text messages and other electronic messages is not required to use the Services. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve any applicable charges and to consent to receive calls, texts or other communications at the number you provide.

Your privacy is very important to us. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and when we share personal information and other data with others. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your username and password. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and you agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or use of your account. We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to any unauthorized access or use of your account.
10. Links
The Web Site and Services may contain links to other websites and online resources. A link to a third party's website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any third-party website. You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website before using it.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ESSEX OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR THE INDIRECT LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, OR DATA) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE WEB SITE OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND UNDER WHATEVER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY BROUGHT (INCLUDING UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORT THEORY OF LIABILITY) EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit our liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.
15. Indemnification

You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms, the Web Site, or Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.
The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.
We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.
