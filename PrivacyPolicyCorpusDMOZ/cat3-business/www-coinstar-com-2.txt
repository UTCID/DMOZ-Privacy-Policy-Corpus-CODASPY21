16. Financial Material Disclosure
16.1. Forward-Looking Statements. The Services, and any documents issued by us and available through the Services, may contain statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Those statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “anticipate” or similar statements or the negative of these words. Forward-looking statements include statements made as to future operations, costs, capital expenditures, cash flow, improvements in infrastructure, distribution and replenishment systems and operating efficiencies, sales and earnings estimates or trends and expansion plans and projections. These forward-looking statements are based on our expectations as of the date such forward-looking statements are made. Known and unknown internal and external risks and uncertainties may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. The information contained in any Annual Report on Form 10-K and any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including information contained under the section captioned “Risk Factors”, identifies important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statements were made.
16.2. Press Releases. The information contained within press releases issued by us should not be deemed accurate or current except as of the date the release was posted. We have no intention of updating, and specifically disclaim any duty to update, the information in the press releases. To the extent any information therein is forward-looking, it is intended to fit within the safe harbor for forward-looking statements, and is subject to material risk.
16.3. Third-Party Financial Information. We may provide links to third-party websites or services that contain financial or investment information about us. Access to such websites and the information contained therein is provided as service to those interested in the information. We neither regularly monitor nor have control over the content of third parties’ statements or websites. Accordingly, we do not endorse or adopt these websites or any information contained therein, including, without limitation, analysts’ reports and stock quotes. We make no representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness of the content, information, or opinions of third-party websites or other third-party information that is identified on the Services. Users visit these websites and use the information contained therein at their own risk.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Coinstar and our affiliates, subsidiaries, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and our and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (together with Coinstar, the “Coinstar Parties”) from and against any and all actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (collectively, “Claims”) arising out of or related to (a) your use or misuse of the Services, (b) any User Content or Feedback you provide, (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your violation of the rights of any third party. You agree to promptly notify Coinstar of any third party Claims, cooperate with the Coinstar Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees).

We reserve the right to change the Services and the Materials and to modify, suspend or discontinue the Services or any features or functionality of the Services at any time without notice, obligation or liability to you.
22. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION 22 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES WITH COINSTAR AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COINSTAR.
22.1. Binding Arbitration. Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action within the limited jurisdiction of a small claims court (a “Small Claims Action”) or seeks only injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents (an “Intellectual Property Injunctive Action”), you and Coinstar agree: (a) to waive your and Coinstar’s right to have any and all disputes arising from or connected to these Terms and/or the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in a court; and (b) to waive your and Coinstar’s right to a jury trial. Instead, you and Coinstar agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
22.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. YOU AND COINSTAR AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES  ARE PERSONAL TO YOU AND COINSTAR, AND THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND COINSTAR AGREE THAT A DISPUTE CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS.
22.3. Federal Arbitration Act. You and Coinstar agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 22 shall be governed by, construed and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
22.4. Process. YOU AND COINSTAR AGREE THAT WE WILL NOTIFY EACH OTHER IN WRITING OF ANY DISPUTE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF WHEN IT ARISES SO THAT WE CAN ATTEMPT IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY. Notice to Coinstar shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Coinstar, LLC, Attn: General Counsel, 1800 114th Avenue SE. Bellevue, WA 98004. Your notice must include: (a) your name and contact information; (b) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking.. If you and Coinstar cannot agree to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of Coinstar receiving your notice, then either you or we may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 22, commence an arbitration proceeding, file an action to compel arbitration or, in the case of a Small Claims Case or an Intellectual Property Injunctive Action, file a claim in court. YOU AND COINSTAR AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM MUST BE COMMENCED OR FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISE; OTHERWISE, YOU AND COINSTAR AGREE THAT THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT A CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). You and Coinstar agree that (1) any arbitration will occur in the county of your residence or a mutually agreed-upon location, which you may attend either in person or via video conference or telephone; (2) the state or federal courts in the county of your residence, or in which you used our Services shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action to compel arbitration; (3) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (4) the state or federal courts in the county in which the arbitration occurred will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award and over any Intellectual Property Injunctive Action and that small claims courts in the jurisdiction in which you reside will have jurisdiction over any Small Claims Case.
22.5. Authority of Arbitrator.
As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
22.6. Rules of JAMS. The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
22.7. Severability. If any provision of this Section 22 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law and all other provisions will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 22.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable except as prohibited by applicable law.
22.8. Changes. Notwithstanding the modification-related provisions in these Terms, if we revise the dispute resolution provisions of the Terms, you may reject any such change within thirty (30) days of the date such change becomes effective by providing Coinstar with written notice of such rejection by writing to: Coinstar, LLC, Attn: General Counsel, 1800 114th Avenue SE. Bellevue, WA 98004. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Section 22. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the last version of the Terms you accepted.

24. Termination

25. Severability
If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
