On termination of an order either party may by notice require that its confidential information be returned, destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable by any person (regardless of the format in its is held). This requirement does not apply to copies held in the other party’s automated electronic back-up systems or information which has to be retained by the other party under applicable law. To the extent that such materials are to be returned, they shall be delivered up in such intelligible form as the requesting party shall reasonably require. The party requested to return or destroy materials shall have a duly authorised signatory confirm in writing that it has been done, and shall procure that its authorised sub-contractors do likewise. Termination of an order does not prevent you or us enforcing any rights you or we may have against each other, which relate to the period of time before termination. You and we may use any legal means available to you or us to do so.
All the provisions of an order which are expressed or intended to have effect on, or at any time after, the termination of that order shall survive its termination.
OUR REMEDIES
If you do not comply with the terms of an order (for example, if you deliver an instalment late, outside of any permitted tolerances, without the relevant certificates, or the products do not comply with the relevant specification) or if we exercise our rights of termination under these terms and conditions, then we may at our sole discretion: • reject the affected delivery in whole or in part; • reject any subsequent delivery by you; • where we reject any products that do not conform with the relevant specification, testing and/or certification requirements, require you to replace the same with products that do conform within such reasonable timescale as we may determine at our sole discretion; • return some or all of the products to you at your cost and risk. • require you to repay some or all of the sums we have paid to you relating to the order; • require you to pay an amount to us in accordance with the section “liquidated damages” below; • order compliant products from a third party at then current market rates, in which event you shall indemnify us for all costs and expenses (including legal and other professional expenses) that we incur in doing so; • accept any non-conforming delivery in whole or in part, which may be subject to contractual conditions; and/or • require you to provide us with a written report setting out the reasons for such non-compliance and the steps you are to take to rectify the position so as to ensure that such non-compliance is not repeated, and in the event of any repeated non-compliance, on us giving notice to you to such effect, you shall provide us with an equivalent report that shall be contractually binding on you as if incorporated directly into these terms and conditions, and which (at our discretion) shall be initially delivered to us by means of a presentation in a face to face meeting, given by your chief executive director (or equivalent).

SUB-CONTRACTING AND SUB-AGENTS
You shall not sub-contract your obligations under an order without our prior written consent (which may be subject to conditions).

You shall ensure that any such sub-contractor complies with the terms of an order, including all agreed quality assurance procedures.
NO PUBLICITY
You may not do anything with a view to seeking publicity concerning our relationship with you (whether specific to an order or generic) without our prior written consent in each case, which may be subject to conditions. MISCELLANEOUS We may record each telephone call you and we hold in relation to an order.
Only the parties to an order shall be entitled to benefit from its terms. Each order constitutes the entire agreement between you and us in relation to its subject matter, and (save as expressly set out above) it supersedes any prior agreement between you and us on the same subject matter. You and we each enter into an order without relying on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any representation of the other party (however given, including any forecast) which may have been made prior to its effective date. This paragraph shall not affect your or our liability in respect of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. Each order shall be governed by the law of England and Wales.

Except as expressly set out in these terms and conditions, no variation or amendment to an order shall be effective unless in writing and agreed by both parties.
A waiver of any right under an order is only effective if it is in writing and signed by the waiving party, and it applies only to the person to whom the waiver is addressed and the circumstances for which it is given. Any failure by either party to enforce at any time and for any period any one or more of the terms of, or rights arising pursuant to, an order shall not be a waiver of such terms or rights, or of the right at any time subsequently to enforce all the terms of, and rights arising under, an order. If any provision of an order (or part of a provision) is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the parties.

OUR REMEDIES
If you do not comply with the terms of an order (for example, if you deliver an instalment late, outside of any permitted tolerances, without the relevant certificates, or the products do not comply with the relevant specification) or if we exercise our rights of termination under the these terms and conditions, then we may at our sole discretion: • reject the affected delivery in whole or in part; • reject any subsequent delivery by you; • where we reject any products that do not conform with the relevant specification, testing and/or certification requirements, require you to replace the same with products that do conform within such reasonable timescale as we may determine at our sole discretion; • return some or all of the products to you at your cost and risk. • require you to repay some or all of the sums we have paid to you relating to the order; • require you to pay an amount to us in accordance with the section “liquidated damages” below; • order compliant products from a third party at then current market rates, in which event you shall indemnify us for all costs and expenses (including legal and other professional expenses) that we incur in doing so; • accept any non-conforming delivery in whole or in part, which may be subject to contractual conditions; and/or • require you to provide us with a written report setting out the reasons for such non-compliance and the steps you are to take to rectify the position so as to ensure that such non-compliance is not repeated, and in the event of any repeated non-compliance, on us giving notice to you to such effect, you shall provide us with an equivalent report that shall be contractually binding on you as if incorporated directly into these terms and conditions, and which (at our discretion) shall be initially delivered to us by means of a presentation in a face to face meeting, given by your chief executive director (or equivalent). Our rights under this section can be exercised concerning any instalment agreed as part of an order, or an order as a whole. They can also be exercised at any time, even if we have earlier accepted some products relating to the same order.
Our rights under this section are in addition to, and are not in place of any lawful rights and remedies we may have, including concerning latent or other defects which cannot be readily identified on reasonable inspection.
General No term of an order is intended to exclude or limit any liability which cannot be limited or excluded in accordance with applicable law, or to entitle us to recover twice for the same loss. This paragraph takes precedence over all other terms of an order. Our maximum liability to you under an order (however arising, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) shall be to pay an amount equal to the price for the products.
Liquidated damages If you are in breach of an order, we may require you to pay an amount to us on demand in accordance with the order form by way of liquidated damages. You acknowledge and agree that any such amount is a reasonable pre-estimate of the losses we may suffer in the event of a relevant breach by you.
General indemnities You shall indemnify us and keep us indemnified against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, fines, costs and expenses (including legal and other professional expenses) however arising, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, that we incur arising from: • any action or investigation by any governmental regulator in any jurisdiction relating to the products save to the extent that such action or investigation is a result of our own negligence, breach of contract or breach of applicable law; • your, or any of your authorised sub-contractors', fraud; or • any claims by a third party resulting from your material breach of an order or negligence.
AUDIT
We shall be entitled to audit you in connection with your compliance with an order, either ourselves or through use of third party auditors acting as our agent. We may do so no more than once per calendar year, without notice. You shall co-operate with any such audit and during its course, on request supply us with all such information, data and records of whatsoever nature as may be requested by us (including all relevant test samples, laboratory test data and test records) which we shall be entitled to copy. All information, data and records obtained during the course of any such audit shall be treated as your confidential information.
During the course of any audit you shall make available such of your staff as we may reasonably request, including members of your senior management with the appropriate level of expertise and authority to answer any reasonable enquiries we may have.
Without prejudice to our other rights and remedies under an order, if as a result of an audit, we discover that you are not acting in compliance with an order, then you shall promptly take such actions as are necessary in order to achieve such compliance. In carrying out any audit, we shall comply with any health and safety and security requirements you notify to us in writing.
CONFIDENTIALITY
You and we shall both, during the term of an order and for 6 years thereafter (a) keep confidential all of the other party's confidential information, (b) only use the other party's confidential information for the purpose of complying with, or taking professional advice regarding, an order, and (c) protect the other party's confidential information in its possession from unauthorised use or disclosure using at least the same standard of care as it employs in protecting its own confidential information. Each party acknowledges that, if it is in breach of its obligations under this section "Confidentiality", the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any other right available under applicable law.
ANTI-CORRUPTION
You shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidance relating to the prevention of bribery and corruption. You shall not engage in any activity, practice or conduct which involves the provision of any financial advantage to any person in return for the improper performance of their or another person’s duties, or which would otherwise constitute an offence if such activity, practice or conduct had been carried out in the United Kingdom. You shall comply with any anti-corruption policy we provide to you from time to time. You shall immediately notify us of any request or demand for any undue financial or other advantage of any kind received by you.
You undertake that no public official (for example, an individual holding any legislative, public administrative or judicial position): • is an officer or employee or yours or shall be an officer or employee of yours in the future; • has any direct or indirect interest in you or shall have any such interest in the future. You shall provide such supporting evidence of compliance with the provisions of this section as we may reasonably request from time to time.
NOTICES
All notices and other communications about an order shall be communicated:
(a) by pre-paid courier or registered post, in which event it shall take effect one week after the date of sending or posting (as applicable). (b) by hand, in which event it shall take effect when actually delivered; (c) by email sent in accordance with this paragraph. An email notice must be sent from an authorised sender of one party to all of the authorised recipients of the other party. It must also be sent between 9am and 5.30pm (local time, place of receipt) on a business day with “delivery receipt” functionality enabled in the sending party’s email application (wherever such functionality exits). An email notice shall not be effective if a delivery error message or valid out-of-office message is received in response from all of the receiving party’s authorised recipients. An email notice shall take effect when receipt is acknowledged by any of the receiving party's authorised recipients, or in the absence of such acknowledgment, 3 hours after the time of transmission as recorded by the sending party's email application.
If the above provisions result in a notice taking effect on a date that is not a business day, or after 5.30pm (local time in the place of receipt) on a business day, the notice shall instead take effect at 10am (local time in the place of receipt) on the next following business day.
Notices and other communications shall be served in accordance with the details specified in the order form, as updated from time to time by notice from the relevant party.
SUB-CONTRACTING AND SUB-AGENTS
You shall not sub-contract your obligations under an order without our prior written consent (which may be subject to conditions). The appointment of a sub-contractor in relation to an order shall not relieve either party from any of its obligations. You shall ensure that any such sub-contractor complies with the terms of an order, including all agreed quality assurance procedures.
NO PUBLICITY
You may not do anything with a view to seeking publicity concerning our relationship with you (whether specific to an order or generic) without our prior written consent in each case, which may be subject to conditions.
MISCELLANEOUS
We may record each telephone call you and we hold in relation to an order.
Only the parties to an order shall be entitled to benefit from its terms. Each order constitutes the entire agreement between you and us in relation to its subject matter, and (save as expressly set out above) it supersedes any prior agreement between you and us on the same subject matter. You and we each enter into an order without relying on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any representation of the other party (however given, including any forecast) which may have been made prior to its effective date. This paragraph shall not affect your or our liability in respect of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. Each order shall be governed by the law of England and Wales.
Except as provided in this paragraph, neither party shall novate, assign, declare a trust over or otherwise transfer or create any encumbrance over or in respect of any order except with the prior written consent of the other party. We may assign an order to any member of our group without your consent. You may create an encumbrance over an order where expressly permitted by the terms of the order form. Except as expressly set out in these terms and conditions, no variation or amendment to an order shall be effective unless in writing and agreed by both parties.
A waiver of any right under an order is only effective if it is in writing and signed by the waiving party, and it applies only to the person to whom the waiver is addressed and the circumstances for which it is given. Any failure by either party to enforce at any time and for any period any one or more of the terms of, or rights arising pursuant to, an order shall not be a waiver of such terms or rights, or of the right at any time subsequently to enforce all the terms of, and rights arising under, an order. If any provision of an order (or part of a provision) is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the parties. Unless specifically provided otherwise, rights arising under an order are cumulative and do not exclude rights provided by law.
