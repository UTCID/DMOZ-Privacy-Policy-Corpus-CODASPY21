How We Disclose Personal Data
Carhartt will only disclose your Personal Data with your knowledge and as stated in this Privacy Policy or as indicated at the time of collection. This includes disclosures that will enable us to fulfill our obligations to you, and allows us to manage our business operations. We will only share your Personal Data with third parties in certain limited instances, namely with your consent, or as is necessary to complete a transaction or provide a product, service, or feature that you have requested.
We may disclose your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy and in the following ways:
To Affiliates, Partners, Vendors, and Suppliers
We share Personal Data among our Carhartt family of companies. We do this to run our business more efficiently and to have a better understanding of our Consumers across all of our business lines.
We also work with partners, vendors, distributors, and suppliers. These third parties may have access to or process your Personal Data, but only to the extent it is necessary for them to (1) provide their products and services to us, or (2) to provide you the products and services that you have requested. For example, we may use third-party providers to assist us with marketing and advertising our products and Services, delivering customer service and support (for example, when you have a question, complaint or technical issue with your account), and for e-commerce order fulfillment.
During Recruitment and Job Applications
When you submit an application for employment, we will collect your Personal information, including any information contained on a resume or curriculum vitae. This information is used worldwide to build our team as we look to hire talented teammates. We also may keep the information you submit in connection with an application for employment on file for future consideration.
To Enable the Use of Our Services
Personal Data that is collected through the Services may be used or disclosed to third parties in order to enable us to provide Services. For example, the Carhartt website may allow you to interface with a third-party website or application, such as PayPal or UPS.
In Community Forums
Any information you post or disclose in our community forums (for example, Facebook, BoldChat, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Olapic, Turn To, or other sponsored pages on the Carhartt Blog) is public. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in community forums, such as bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, and networking functions of mobile applications. Exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas, and be careful what Personal Data you disclose and how you disclose it. Content posted in our community forums, including advice and opinions, represents the views of the individuals who post that Content and such individuals bear sole and exclusive responsibility for the posting of that content. Carhartt does not necessarily endorse, support, verify, or agree with any content posted in our Community Forums.
As We Grow and Change – Corporate Transactions and Reorganizations
If we should ever merge with another company, or if Carhartt should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, we may disclose or transfer, to the extent permitted by law and in compliance with any applicable requirements to notify you, your Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers or successor entities in connection with one of these transactions or reorganizations.
As Required by Law and Special Circumstances
We may be required, subject to applicable law, to disclose your Personal Data if: (i) it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority, (ii) such a disclosure would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) it is necessary to protect our legal rights or property, or (iv) it is necessary to protect the legal rights or property or physical security of others, or for the prevention or detection of crime and such disclosure is lawful.
