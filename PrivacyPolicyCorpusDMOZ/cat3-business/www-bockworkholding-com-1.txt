IN NO EVENT WILL JERGENS’ LIABILITY ARISING OUT THESE TERMS AND YOUR USE OF THE SITE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FROM YOUR PURCHASE OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES VIA THE SITE, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR OWE FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED VIA THE SITE IN THE LAST TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.  THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND JERGENS.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
14. IndemnificationNOTICE TO NEW JERSEY USERS:  If you live in New Jersey, this section does not apply to you.  You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Jergens, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers from and against any claim, action, demand, loss, liability, expenses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential, or otherwise), arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Site or these Terms.  YOU AGREE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR LOSSES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
15. Limitations on LiabilityNOTICE TO NEW JERSEY USERS: If you live in New Jersey, this section does not apply to you.
We exclude all representations, warranties, conditions, and terms (whether express or implied by statute, common law, or otherwise), to the fullest extent permitted by law.
To the extent permitted by law, you agree that Jergens will not be liable for any damages, claims or losses incurred (including, but not limited to, compensatory, incidental, indirect, special, consequential, or exemplary damages), however caused or under any theory of liability arising in connection with (i) the Site; (ii) the use or inability to use the Site; (iii) the use of or reliance on any content or information displayed in or on the Site; (iv) the purchase or use of any products through the Site or otherwise; (v) unauthorized access to or alteration of your data that is sent to or received by the Site; or (vi) errors, system down time, network or system outages, file corruption, or service interruptions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Jergens’ liability to you for any cause of action or claim will be limited to the amount paid, if any, by you in the last twelve (12) months to Jergens for any products or services supplied by Jergens through your use of the Site or otherwise.
Jergens will not be liable in any amount for failure to perform any obligation under these terms if such failure is caused by the occurrence of any unforeseen contingency beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, internet outages and/or communications outages.
These exclusions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. If any provision or part of any provision of these terms is declared invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, it will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these terms.
The terms of this section survive any termination of these Terms.
16. International UsersOur website is controlled, operated, and administered by Jergens from its offices in Cleveland, Ohio.  Jergens makes no representation that materials on the Site are appropriate or available for use at other locations outside the United States, and access to them is prohibited from territories where the contents or products available through the Site are illegal.  You may not use the Site or export its website content or products in violation of United States export laws and regulations.  If you access the Site from a location outside of the United States, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws.
17. TerminationNOTICE TO NEW JERSEY USERS: If you live in New Jersey, this section does not apply to you.Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Jergens reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, to terminate your ability to use the Site and to block and prevent future access to and use of the Site.  You agree that Jergens will not be liable for any termination of your use of or access to the Site.
18. No Third-Party BeneficiariesOnly you and Jergens are entitled to enforce these Terms.  These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Jergens.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the payment card networks are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms for purposes of enforcing provisions relating to payments, but that their consent or agreement is not necessary for any changes or modifications to these Terms.  You and Jergens also agree that if Jergens assigns, transfers, or sub-contracts any of our rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party in writing, such third party may enforce the Terms that are assigned, transferred, or sub-contracted.
19.  SeverabilityIf any provision of these Terms, or part thereof, is deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision, or part thereof, will be deemed severable from the rest of the Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions or part thereof.
The terms of this section survive terminations of the Terms.
20. Disputes, Binding and Confidential Arbitration, and Waiver of Class Actions and Class ArbitrationsAS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, WE EACH AGREE TO SETTLE DISPUTES (EXCEPT CERTAIN SMALL CLAIMS) ONLY BY ARBITRATION.  BY USING THE SITE AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO WAIVE AND ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SUE JERGENS IN COURT AND YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.  YOU AND JERGENS EACH AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE ARBITRATED.  THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT.  THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, AND REVIEW IS LIMITED, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THE AGREEMENT AS A COURT WOULD.
Disputes.  The terms of this section will apply to all Disputes between you and Jergens.  For purposes of this section, “Disputes” means any dispute, claim, or action between you and Jergens arising under or relating to our products, the Site, , the Jergens Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and these Terms, and/or any other transaction involving you and Jergens, whether in contract, warranty, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and will be interpreted to have given the broadest meaning allowable under law.  You and Jergens agree that “Dispute” as defined in these terms will not include any claim or cause of action by you or Jergens for (i) trade secret misappropriation; (ii) patent infringement; (iii) copyright infringement or misuse; or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution.  Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you and Jergens agree that a court, not an arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.
Confidential and Binding Arbitration.  You and Jergens agree to confidential and binding arbitration of all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in this section.  ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU AND JERGENS WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.  You and Jergens also agree that (i) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (ii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this section; and (iii) this section will survive termination of these Terms.  The arbitrator may award the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction could, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief warranted by a claim.  In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation, and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.  The decision of the arbitrator will be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.
Small Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.  Jergens does not hereby waive any defense and expressly reserves its right to assert any defense available to it in any such action, whether jurisdictional or otherwise.
Dispute Notice.  In the event of a Dispute, you or Jergens must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that includes a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”).  The Dispute Notice to Jergens must be addressed and sent by certified mail to:  Attn: Dispute Notice Agent, Jergens, 15700 South Waterloo Rd. Cleveland, OH 44110 (the “Jergens Notice”).  The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.  If Jergens and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, either you or Jergens may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this section.  Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.
WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.  YOU AND JERGENS AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION, AN ARBITRATOR WILL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.
Arbitration Procedure.  If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be governed by the terms set forth in this section and the Expedited Arbitration Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Procedures”), which are available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  The parties expressly agree that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration will be limited to the resolution of individual claims only.  If there is a conflict between the JAMS Procedures and the terms set forth in this section, the terms in this section will govern.  The parties may, in arbitration, seek all remedies otherwise available to them pursuant to federal, state, or local laws.  All Disputes will be resolved by a single neutral JAMS arbitrator, and both parties will have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this section.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.  Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the JAMS arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, each of which is excluded from the definition of “Dispute” as stated above.  The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.  The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The parties may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.  Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone will take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Washington, DC, at your option.
Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.  If either you or Jergens decide to arbitrate a Dispute, the parties agree to the following procedure:
Write a Demand for Arbitration.  The Demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered (the “Demand for Arbitration”).  A sample demand for arbitration is available at http://jamsadr.com.
Send three (3) copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to:JAMS555 13th Street, NWSuite 400 WestWashington, DC 20004
Send by certified mail one (1) copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address listed for the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to in advance by the parties.
Hearing Format.  In all hearings, the arbitrator will issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.  The amount of any settlement offer made by Jergens or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator, if at all, until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Jergens is entitled.  The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute will be governed by the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures.
Arbitration Fees.  Jergens will pay, or (if applicable), reimburse, you for all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitration fees for any arbitration commenced by you or Jergens pursuant to the terms of this section.
Opt-Out.  You may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure or waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this section by sending a written letter by certified mail to Jergens, Inc., 15700 South Waterloo Rd., Cleveland, OH 44110 within thirty (30) days of your first visit to and use of the Site that specifies your (i) name; (ii) mailing address; and (iii) request to be excluded from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure or waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this section.  In the event you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms and conditions in these Terms will continue to apply.
Amendments to this Section.  Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, you and Jergens agree that if Jergens makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions set forth in this section (other than a change to the parties’ addresses), Jergens will post notice of such amendments on the Site and you will have thirty (30) days from your first visit to, or use of, the Site containing such amendments to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments.  If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you agree you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this section as stated in this current section, without any of the proposed amendments governing.  If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to such future amendments.
Severability.  If any provision of this section is found to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section and these Terms remaining in full force and effect.  The foregoing will not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire section will be null and void.  The terms of this section will otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.
21. Exclusive Venue for Other ControversiesJergens and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure or class action waiver provisions in these Terms (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) will be filed only in the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.
22. Entire AgreementThese Terms and Jergens’ Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy constitute the entire agreements between Jergens and you with respect to your use of the Site and your purchase of any products or services through the Site.
23. Time Period for Bringing ClaimsYou and Jergens agree that any cause of action either may have with respect to the Site, or Jergens’ products or services must be commenced within one (1) year after the Dispute arises, notwithstanding any statutes of limitations to the contrary.  Many states’ laws set statutes of limitations that are longer than one (1) year.  If you live in a state that has statutes of limitations that are longer than one (1) year, by agreeing to these Terms, you are agreeing to shorten the time you have to bring a claim.  This means that if you wait longer than one (1) year to initiate an arbitration under this section, you will lose some or all rights you may have to any recovery, including the right to recover damages, in connection with a Dispute.
NOTICE TO NEW JERSEY USERS:  If you live in New Jersey, your agreement to this provision shortens the time within which you may bring a Dispute.
24. Miscellaneous Terms  The section titles used in these Terms are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
Nothing in these Terms will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Jergens, and you do not have any authority to create any obligation on Jergens’ behalf.  You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations of these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Jergens’ written consent.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against you and Jergens and their respective successors and assigns.
The terms of this section survive any termination of these Terms.
25. Other Important TermsThese Terms supersede any other terms and conditions previously posted or published by Jergens and any other representations or oral statements made by us to you.  No delay by Jergens in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms will operate as a waiver of that right or remedy or will affect our ability to subsequently exercise that right or remedy.  Any waiver must be agreed by Jergens in writing.
