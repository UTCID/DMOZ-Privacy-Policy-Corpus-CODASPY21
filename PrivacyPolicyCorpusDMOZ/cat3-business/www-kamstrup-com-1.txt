Source
Personal data is collected directly from you, including any queries made by you or the company you represent by telephone, e-mail, at trade fairs etc. Data is also received via the website e.g. through e-mail inserts and other tracking mechanisms.
Legal basis for collecting and processing personal data
The legal basis for the processing of data for the above purposes is as follows:
Consent for direct marketing e-mail, cf. the Danish Marketing Practice Act
Website and the use of other tracking mechanisms in e-mails, cf. ePrivacy Directive
The provision on the balancing of interests in Article 6(1)(f), as it is in Kamstrup’s legitimate interests to provide you and the company you represent a focused service and to be able to protect IT systems and data about the company
Our legal obligations as a data service provider e.g. in terms of IT security
Necessary steps taken at your request prior to entering into a potential contract
Necessary steps taken in order to provide in queries with any information requested by you
Should a dispute arise between a third party, e.g. your employer and us, the legal basis defines how we can determine, defend and plead our legal claim.
Withdrawal of consent
If the processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. This will not affect the processing of data handed over or done prior to the withdrawal of consent.
Storage period
We keep your personal data on file in our CRM system during the period we are in contact with you, and the company you represent. It is possible that we will keep them longer, if this is required to manage documentation, contractual performance or legal requirements.
Data concerning documentation of consent for receiving promotional material sent by e-mail (direct marketing only) is kept for three years after being sent (as per the rules on limitation of action). This is unless other data is included in the same communication that justifies a longer processing period for other purposes e.g. a legal requirement.
In conformity with legal requirements, we process this data for as long as it is necessary to manage third party interests or our interests.
Obligation to provide information
You are not obligated to give us the information we request from you. However, please be informed that if you refrain from submitting the required information, you may not be entitled to use services offered.
