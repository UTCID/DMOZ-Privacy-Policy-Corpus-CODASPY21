Policy - Forced Localization
Forced Localization
Go Back
Technological innovation has driven growth and revolutionized all economic sectors, creating unimagined goods and services and offering new opportunities for companies large and small. In response to the rapid and profound changes brought about by technology, some governments have implemented forced localization policies—essentially, policies that require part or all of companies’ business operations to take place within their borders—in an effort to promote economic growth, advance privacy and security, or protect local firms and industries. Such policies are misguided, however; they impose significant negative impacts on economies by increasing the costs of doing business, diverting trade and investment, distorting markets, undermining security, and discouraging innovation. ITI leads efforts to inform and engage governments around the world on the dangers of forced localization policies, while working with them to implement more effective options for achieving their public policy objectives.
Our Forced Localization Blog Series goes in depth to educate and address various forms of forced localization.
To see how ITI is engaging on forced localization issues around the globe, see ITI’s Country Strategy Briefs.
For an introduction to data flows and their importance to the global economy and society, see the ITI Decodes Data Flows Video
In-Depth: Data Localization
ITI works to counter misguided policies called data localization that can have serious, harmful, and unintended consequences to economies and citizens alike.
