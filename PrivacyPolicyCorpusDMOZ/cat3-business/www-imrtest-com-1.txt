Sample and Document Retention Policy Change
Due to recent changes in regulatory requirements, IMR Test Labs is providing notification of current quality policies, as well as a change to sample and test report and supporting documentation retention time occurring at all IMR locations worldwide:
SAMPLE RETENTION: Beginning Dec. 1, 2018, all test samples will be stored for THREE (3) months after completion of testing and then recycled, unless otherwise instructed by the customer. If 3 months retention does not meet your requirements, please click the "COMPLETE REQUEST FORM HERE" link below and let us know your needs.
DOCUMENT RETENTION: Test reports and supporting documentation will be retained for a minimum of FIVE (5) years and then securely destroyed, unless otherwise instructed by the customer. If 5 years retention does not meet your requirements, please click the "COMPLETE REQUEST FORM HERE" link below and let us know your requirements.
DECISION RULE: When customers request conformance of results to specifications, conformance will be reported based on results without measurement uncertainty applied. Note that this is not a change to our current policy, we are now required to state this policy to our customers.
HANDLING FEE: IMR Test Labs reserves the right to charge a handling fee (in addition to regular shipping charges) for preparation and shipping of samples that have been requested to be returned, handled on a case by case basis.
COMPLETE REQUEST FORM HERE
Please note, if we do not hear from you, these new policies will be instituted beginning December 1, 2018.
