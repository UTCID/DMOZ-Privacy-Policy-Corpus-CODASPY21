Blackmer Technologies
Sliding Vane Pumps
Positive displacement sliding vane pumps are designed with unique "self-adjusting" vanes that allow them to maintain near-original volumetric performance during the life of the pump - meaning these pumps are not subject to efficiency-robbing slip that occurs from wear in gear and lobe pumps.
Reciprocating Gas Compressors
Designed to deliver high efficiency in handling LPG, natural gas and other industrial liquefied gases, Blackmer oil-free reciprocating gas compressors are ideal for the unloading, transfer and recovery of all liquefied gases under the most severe service conditions.
Centrifugal Pumps
Centrifugal pumps are designed for high volume, severe duty applications. These pumps offer the widest window of operation off the BEP (Best Efficiency Point) of any conventional centrifugal pump, and are designed specifically for operation in severe process industry applications.
Regenerative Turbine Pumps
Regenerative turbine pumps offered by Blackmer have been specifically designed and precision built for high-pressure transfer in Autogas applications. The secret to the success of these pumps is the innovative impeller design, which optimizes hydraulic performance.
Screw Pumps
Available in both twin and triple screw models, Blackmer S Series screw pumps are self-priming, double-ended positive displacement pumps that offer outstanding performance in the most demanding applications regardless of temperature, viscosity or pressure.
Our Markets
Industry-leading expertise across each of these markets allows us to work closely with our partners and customers to solve their most complex industrial application issues.
