If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Site after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.

Generally
The Site is intended to be accessed and used only by adults 18 years of age or older.

You verify that the information you provide while creating an account regarding your age is accurate and truthful.
Online Store
The shopping cart and checkout features of the Site may only be accessed and used by persons 18 years of age or older. For each browsing session, navigating to the shopping cart or checkout features on the Site requires affirmative confirmation that the User is over the age of 18.  By responding to this age gate, you verify that the information you provide regarding your age is accurate and truthful. Age is also verified by the payment information required to complete the checkout.
Children
While the Site is intended to be accessed and used only by adults 18 years of age or older, we understand that the nature of our business and the content of our Site may lead to children accessing the Site. We consider a child as any person under the age of 18 years old. If you are under 18 years old, you may not access or use any part of the Site unless and until your parent or guardian has provided written consent.
We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of children should any children access or use our Site. Accordingly, we take extra steps, including, but not limited to, compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), to make sure children have a safe experience should any children access or use our Site. For instance, age gates are used throughout the Site to prevent children from providing information and making purchases. By responding to an age gate, you verify that the information you provide regarding your age is accurate and truthful.
We strongly encourage every parent or guardian to take an active role in monitoring their child’s use of the internet and adopting appropriate safeguards, such as device and browser controls and preferences.  If you have any concerns that your child is accessing or using the Site without your consent, please let us know by e-mail to website@safariltd.com.  For more information on how we handle the personal information of children, please visit our Privacy Policy.

If you want to use certain features of the Site, including earning Bernie Bucks, you’ll have to create an account (“Account”) via the Site and provide your name and e-mail address. Creating an Account will enable you to access and use additional features on the Site.
It is important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we may suspend or terminate your Account. You agree not to disclose your Account password to anyone and to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account.

Orders
Order Confirmation
We will provide an e-mail or other form of confirmation after receipt of your purchase order. Your receipt of an order confirmation merely confirms our receipt of your order and neither indicates our acceptance of your order nor confirms our offer to sell. We reserve the right to refuse or limit any order you place with us. We may also, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, household or order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same Account, Method of Payment (as defined below), e-mail address, and/or using the same billing and/or shipping address. We also reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors. In the event we make a change to or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail address provided at the time the order was made. If we cancel all or any part of your order after your Method of Payment has been charged, we will refund the billed amount.
Shipment Confirmation and Delivery
All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance by sending you an e-mail confirming the products (each, a “Product”) have been shipped. You may choose the method of shipment and timing of delivery for Products you order if more than one method is available, and you will be charged shipping and handling charges accordingly based on your choice. We will not be held liable for deliveries that are delayed due to events that are beyond our control. However, we will work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.
Prices
The prices displayed for Products available for purchase via the Site represent the applicable retail prices, and do not include taxes, shipping or handling charges (to the extent applicable). Any applicable taxes, shipping or handling charges will be communicated to you before you place an order. The prices displayed on the Site are quoted in U.S. dollars. Products in your shopping cart reflect the current price displayed on the Product’s details page. Please note that this price may differ from the price displayed when the Product was first placed in your shopping cart.
Payment
By submitting an order through the Site, you agree to pay in advance the price of the Product(s) ordered, plus any applicable taxes, shipping and handling and/or other charges. Payment may be made by credit card or any other method of payment we may make available to you (each, a “Method of Payment”). In order to make a payment, you must provide us with valid credit card and/or other billing information and authorize us (or any third party payment service provider engaged by us) to charge your Method of Payment for all orders placed and accepted via the Site.
Cancellation, Return and Exchange Policies
Cancellation, return and exchange policies are available to you via the Site. If a Product is not what you expected it to be, please review such policies to learn how and when you may return or exchange a Product purchased via the Site. You agree that any applicable shipping and/or handling charges are non-refundable.
Errors, Inaccuracies and Omissions
We make every effort to present the most recent, accurate, and reliable information on the Site at all times. However, occasionally there may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to Product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, and availability. Any errors are wholly unintentional and we reserve the right to amend errors or to update Product information at any time without prior notice. In the event a Product is listed at an incorrect price due to photographical error, typographical error or any other error in pricing information, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for any Product listed at the incorrect price. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your Method of Payment charged. If your Method of Payment has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we will issue a credit to your Method of Payment in the amount of the incorrect price.
Colors and Style
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and styles of Products that appear on the Site. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any color or style will be accurate.
Cancellation of Orders
We reserve the right to cancel, modify or suspend any order placed if we determine in our sole discretion that a User has violated these Terms, including by engaging in any fraudulent or misleading activity (for example, by using false names, multiple identities, multiple e-mail accounts or e-mail addresses, impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or misleading information), or if we believe, in our sole discretion, that a User’s conduct violates applicable law or is harmful to our interests.
Alerts and Notifications
As part of the Site, you may receive notifications, alerts, e-mails, or other types of messages regarding the Site or your orders (for example, order confirmations, shipment confirmations and/or delivery information). We may also periodically send you e-mails that directly promote the Site and Products (for example, new Product offerings or features we provide, recommendations, special discounts or promotions). Where required, we will obtain your consent before sending any such e-mails.  If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future e-mails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each e-mail or you may contact us online or by e-mail to website@safariltd.com.

In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
