About Ad Choices - Privacy and Data Collection
Johnson & Johnson Inc. ("we", "us" or "our") is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information. We and our media agencies use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, or other similar technologies on our web sites which allow our media agencies to deliver advertisements about our products and services when you visit other web sites or web properties across the Internet. For example, we place a small piece of computer text, a "cookie", on your web browser when you visit one of our sites (including our brand web sites (e.g. NEUTROGENA®)). The cookie allows our media agency to track when your browser visits other web sites within an advertising network, which consists of a number of web pages available for advertising. The browsing information obtained from following your preferences when you visit different sites, can help our media agency to make a prediction about the type of information you may be interested in and can then be used to provide you with ads that are tailored to your interests when you visit other web sites. For example, individuals who visit our NEUTROGENA® website may find ads for NEUTROGENA® on other web sites they visit.
If you would like to learn more about our privacy practices please visit our Privacy Policy. You may also visit the Ad Choices consumer opt-out page to learn more about interest based advertising and manage your preferences for interest based advertising by any of the participating companies listed on the tool. Companies listed in that tool which our media agency uses, as of May 16, 2016, are Turn Inc. and TubeMogul, Inc.
