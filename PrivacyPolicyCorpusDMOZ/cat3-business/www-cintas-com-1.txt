You agree that Cintas is not liable to you or any third party for any termination or suspension of your Membership or for blocking your use of our Services. (B) Any suspension or termination shall not affect your obligations to us under these Terms of Use.

COPYRIGHT POLICY (A) We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect users to do the same. In appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, we may terminate and/or disable the Membership of users suspected to be infringing the copyrights (or other intellectual property rights) of others. Additionally, in appropriate circumstances and in our sole discretion, we may remove or disable access to material on any of our websites or hosted on our systems that may be infringing or the subject of infringing activity. (B) In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512 (“DMCA”), we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the agent that we have designated to receive notifications of claims infringement (its “Designated Agent”). Our Designated Agent is:
Cintas Corporation
Chief Compliance Officer
6800 Cintas Boulevard
Mason, Ohio 45040
privacy@cintas.com
(C) If you are a copyright owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner) and believe that your work’s copyright has been infringed, please report your notice of infringement to us by providing our Designated Agent with a written notification of claimed infringement that includes substantially the following:
(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material. (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted. (v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
We will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the DMCA. Inquiries that do not follow this procedure may not receive a response. 13. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
Any legal proceedings against Cintas that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with our Services or these Terms of Use shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of Cincinnati, Ohio and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. 14.	DISPUTE RESOLUTION & MANDATORY ARBITRATION (A) We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution. You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at Cintas Corporation, Attn: General Counsel, 6800 Cintas Boulevard, Mason, Ohio 45040. We will contact you based on the contact information you have provided us. (B) If after 30 days the parties are unable to resolve any dispute raised under the previous provision, the dispute may only be submitted to arbitration consistent with this Section.
The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate disputes through a court and to have a judge or jury decide their case, but they choose to have any disputes resolved through arbitration. (C) We each agree that any claim or dispute between us, and any claim by either of us against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not signatories to this agreement, whether related to this agreement or otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS under its rules and procedures in effect when the claim is filed. The rules and procedures and other information, including information on fees, may be obtained from JAMS’ website (www.jamsadr.com) or by calling JAMS. (D) We are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Accordingly, this arbitration agreement and any proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction. (E) Exception to Arbitrate. Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court. Further, as set forth below, we each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Cintas, not as part of a classwide claim (i.e., not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn't apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court. 15.	NO CLASS ACTIONS TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING. 16. NO TRIAL BY JURY TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING. 17.	AMENDMENT; ADDITIONAL TERMS (A) We reserve the right in our sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, to modify or discontinue any aspect or feature of our Services or to modify these Terms of Use.
In addition, we reserve the right to provide you with operating rules or additional terms that may govern your use of our Services generally, unique of our Services, or both (“Additional Terms”).
To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms of Use, the Additional Terms will control. (B) Modifications to these Terms of Use or Additional Terms will be effective immediately upon notice, either by posting on the Website, notification by email or through any of our Applications.
It is your responsibility to review the Terms of Use from time to time for any changes or Additional Terms.
Your access and use of our Services following any modification of these Terms of Use or the provision of Additional Terms will signify your assent to and acceptance of the same.
If you object to any subsequent revision to the Terms of Use or to any Additional Terms, immediately discontinue use of our Services and, if applicable, terminate your Membership. 18.	MISCELLANEOUS (A) No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import. (B) Except where specifically stated otherwise, if any part of these Terms of Use is unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, we both agree that only that part of the Terms of Use shall be stricken and that the remaining terms in the Terms of Use shall not be affected. So, for example, if a provision in these terms is found to be unenforceable, we agree an arbitrator (or, if permitted, a court) shall only strike that provision and that the remaining terms of these Terms of Use shall remain in force. (C) Where we have provided you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy or Additional Terms, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English version governs your relationship with us. The English language version takes precedence if there is any contradiction between the English and translated versions. (D) These Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter. (E) You may not assign these Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent.
Any such purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent will be null and void and of no force and effect.
We may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent and without notice.
