Consumer Resources
The Disaster Planning, Recovery, and Rebuilding Resource site provides information on preparing for and recovering from natural disasters.  There are a number of tools and support materials available on the site.  In addition to these resources, a post-storm resource link will be added as necessary by the Fed, to provide banking and other information for targeted recovery zones.
The Foreclosure Resource Center offers information on the Federal Reserve's efforts to mitigate the impact of foreclosures as well as links to local and national news, events, resources and data.  By consolidating numerous resources into a single site, the Center aims to help consumers better understand and, when possible, avoid foreclosure.  There is also  a research and policy section that will help explain federal and state response to foreclosure.
The FDIC provides an easy-to-use tool called the Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) that helps consumers find out if the money they have in deposit accounts at FDIC-insurance banks is fully protected.
