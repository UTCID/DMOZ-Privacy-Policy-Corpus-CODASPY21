Cole Gallery is located in the heart of downtown Edmonds, just blocks from the ferry landing in the center of town. We feature nationally acclaimed Northwest painters and sculptors.  Many of our artist’s works come from the influences of the Impressionists with a wide range of subject and style. We also feature an exquisite collection of realism from masters of still life, landscape and the figure. Beyond that, we have Cole Contemporary, a line of abstract, modern and whimsical paintings. In addition to our beautiful gallery space, we have Cole Art Studio, an 800+ square foot teaching space where Cole Gallery offers over 100 workshops annually, both in-person and through online Zoom classes.
