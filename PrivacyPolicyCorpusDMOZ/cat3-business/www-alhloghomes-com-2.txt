LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
NOTHWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPALACHIAN LOG HOMES, INC., OR ANY OF ITS PARTNERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, OR CONTENT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “PROTECTED ENTITIES”) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM, OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO, THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THIS SITE OR THE CONTENT, MATERIALS AND FUNCTIONS RELATED THERETO, LOST BUSINESS OR LOST SALES, EVEN IF SUCH PROTECTED ENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO CERTAIN USERS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE PROTECTED ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING FROM THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR YOUR USE OF THIS SITE EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU TO APPALACHIAN LOG HOMES, INC. DIRECTLY IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR USE OF THIS SITE.
The Terms and Conditions and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be revised to the minimum extent required by applicable law for such provision to be enforceable and such revised provision shall be considered a part of these Terms and Conditions.
You agree that if any dispute, controversy or claim arises under the Terms and Conditions, and this Site in general, either party may, upon written notice to the other party, request facilitated negotiations. Such negotiations shall be assisted by a neutral facilitator acceptable to both parties and shall require the best efforts of the parties to discuss with each other in good faith their respective positions and, respecting their different interests, to finally resolve such dispute.
Each party may disclose any facts to the other party or to the facilitator, which it, in good faith, considers necessary to resolve the dispute. However, all such disclosures will be deemed in furtherance of settlement efforts and will not be admissible in any subsequent litigation against the disclosing party. Except as agreed by both parties, the facilitator shall keep confidential all information disclosed during negotiations. The facilitator shall not act as a witness for either party in any subsequent arbitration between the parties.
Such facilitated negotiations shall conclude within sixty days from receipt of the written notice unless extended by mutual consent. The parties may also agree at any time to terminate or waive facilitated negotiations. The costs incurred by each party in such negotiations will be borne by it; the fees and expenses of the facilitator, if any, shall be borne equally by the parties.
If any dispute, controversy or claim arises under the Terms and Conditions, and this Site in general, and cannot be resolved by facilitated negotiations (or the parties agree to waive that process) then such dispute, controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration. The arbitration proceeding shall take place in Knox County, Tennessee, unless the parties agree to a different locale. The proceeding shall be governed by the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) or, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines the FAA inapplicable, by the laws of the state in which the proceeding is to take place. In any arbitration instituted hereunder, the proceedings shall proceed in accordance with the then current Arbitration Rules for Professional Accounting and Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association, except that no pre-hearing discovery shall be permitted unless specifically authorized by the arbitration panel.
Such arbitration shall be conducted before a panel of three persons, one chosen by each party and the third selected by the two party-selected arbitrators. The arbitration panel shall have no authority to award non-monetary or equitable relief, and any monetary award shall not include punitive damages. The confidentiality provisions applicable to facilitated negotiation shall also apply to arbitration. The award issued by the arbitration panel may be confirmed in a judgment by any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by an arbitration panel or a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitration panel or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect. The headings in these Terms and Conditions are for reference only and do not affect the substance of the text of these Terms and Conditions.
