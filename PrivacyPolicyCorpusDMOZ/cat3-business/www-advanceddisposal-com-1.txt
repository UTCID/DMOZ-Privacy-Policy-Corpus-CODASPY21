Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Your safety matters.
Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Advanced Disposal," "we," "our," "us" or similar phrases) has tremendous respect for your non-public personal information, and protecting your personal information is one of our top priorities. We respect the privacy of our customers and other users who access this website to learn about or interact with us concerning the collection, storage, access and use of their personal and business information. This privacy statement explains our privacy practices, including how we use the personal information we receive from you. By accessing our website, you agree to the Advanced Disposal privacy policy. It is important that you review this privacy policy prior to registering on or using our website.
Advanced Disposal reserves the right to change, supplement, update or modify this privacy policy at any time without notice at the sole discretion of Advanced Disposal. In the event we modify or change our privacy policy, the modified policy will be posted on our website. The most current privacy policy will apply to all data and other information collected on the website, no matter what version of the privacy policy was in effect when the information was collected.
1. Personal Information Collected by Advanced Disposal We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on our latest services, information and events that you might like to hear about.
We may collect personal information about you from the following sources: (i) information we receive from you pursuant to any service agreement or other agreement with Advanced Disposal, such as your name, address, telephone number or business information; (ii) information we receive from you through our website, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, payment information and your activity while using or reviewing our websites; (iii) information about your transactions with us or information about the services performed by us, our affiliates, or others, such as information concerning your payment history or information about your site location for service, billing and credit card information; and (iv) information we receive from publicly recorded documents.
In addition, we may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate or when purchasing service. We may also collect certain personal information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers in order for us to provide more valuable service.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the website user, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Advanced Disposal and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
2. Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information by Advanced Disposal Advanced Disposal will use personally identifiable information voluntarily submitted to us to respond to requests you make of us for service or to contact you in connection with the service being provided to you by Advanced Disposal. Additionally, we may use that information to determine how we can improve our website, business and services and to market our services. As a general rule, we will not sell or rent your personal or business information to any third party, except as described below or in connection with effectively maintaining and operating the website.
Advanced Disposal may disclose your personal information to others when we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or to protect the safety of our customers, employees or property and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process. We may respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. In addition, we may collect and possibly share personal information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Advanced Disposal terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
Advanced Disposal will share your personal information with our corporate affiliates to carry out transactions you request or to make our business more responsive to your needs, and we may disclose your personal information to non-affiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf. Advanced Disposal may also disclose your personal information to third parties where it is necessary for completing the transactions that you authorize and in order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party. We reserve the right to provide non-personal identifying information to third parties. Except as described above, we will not disclose your personal information to other third parties unless you have provided consent.
3. Payment System If you are using our website to access our electronic payment system, we may request certain financial information so that we may effect the payment transaction. Our payment system may collect, store and use personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, credit card number, bank routing and account number, Advanced Disposal account number and email address to process your payments. In addition, the payment system will also collect information regarding the actual bill payment transactions, including the dates and amounts paid. Advanced Disposal will store and protect this information in the same manner that we store and protect other personal customer information.
Advanced Disposal will typically send emails regarding your bill availability, or we may attach your bill to an email, depending on the choice you have made. We may also send confirmation emails regarding payments and certain types of maintenance. Confirmation emails help guard against fraudulent use of the system.
Advanced Disposal will record your use of the payment system to the extent that we are aware of when login occurs. We will also keep statistics about how the payment system is used. This information helps us plan better services and improve system performance.
4. Security Advanced Disposal is concerned with the security of the data and information we collect, and we use commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help ensure the security, integrity and privacy of all personal information. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide service to you or in order to do their jobs.
We use encrypted transmission (Secure Socket Layer - SSL) for all transactions on our website. If we attach your bill to an email, we use encrypted Adobe Acrobat PDF files. However, due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet, no security measures should be viewed as 100 percent effective in all circumstances. Advanced Disposal cannot absolutely guarantee against a breach of its security or the actions of third parties who may seek to obtain unauthorized access to personal information. All transmissions of your personal information are done at your own risk.
You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal account, passwords and other personal information when using our website or the Internet in general. Change your passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers.
5. Links to Other Websites Our website may contain links to websites that are provided and maintained by third parties and that are not subject to this privacy policy. Please review the privacy policies on those websites. We make no representations concerning, and are not responsible for, any such third-party websites or their privacy policies or practices.
6. Cookies As is standard practice on many corporate websites, our website uses "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. The use of cookies or similar technologies helps us to improve our service to you. Our cookies do not collect your personal information. Your browser can most likely be configured to notify you when cookies will be received and offer you the option of refusing cookies. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some areas may be limited. Advanced Disposal will not share cookies with any third party other than as set forth in this privacy policy, and we will not place shared cookies or customer profiling banner advertisements on our website.
If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact our IT Department or Legal Department at (904) 737-7900.
