Host Dorothy Cociu interviews once again attorney Marilyn Monahan of Monahan Law office. In part 2, we will start with an update from Part 1, where we discuss the newly signed California law AB 1867, which expands paid sick leave similar to FFCRA for California employers with 500 or more employees, then we discuss several California state and federal legal updates, including AB-5, the independent contractor’s law in California, recent changes to the ACA, new federal forms that were released, Grandfathered Plans proposed rule changes, California Paid Leave Programs, and Harassment training requirements in California.
