Children's Privacy Policy
DDL takes great pride in the relationships we have established with our customers.  DDL recognizes the need for additional protection when children provide personally identifiable information online.  Building upon our Privacy Policy/California Privacy Rights, the Children's Privacy Policy of Dippin' Dots, LLC is designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and other applicable law.  Our information collection practices as applied to children under the age of 13 are described below.  However, we encourage any child under 18 to check with their parent or legal guardian before entering any information on any website, and we would further encourage parents or guardians to discuss with their children the consequences of disclosing any identifying information on the internet.
Information Collected.  DDL prefers not to collect and usually does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  However, from time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes, surveys, clubs, or newsletters in which children under the age of 13 will be required to register in order to participate.  The information we collect from kids during our registration process generally consists of a  first name, initial of the last name, e-mail address, date of birth, zip code, username, and a password.  The birth date is used for age validation for contest or sweepstakes purposes and potentially future internal marketing purposes if enrolled in our clubs or newsletters.  We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from kids during our registration process or require the disclosure of more personal information than is needed to participate in any activity.
Parental Notification.  When a child under the age of 13 has registered at our Site, we will provide an e-mail notifying the parents or guardians of the child's registration within 5 business days.  A parent or guardian has the right to refuse entry into any sweepstakes or contest for a child under the age of 13, and we will delete any stored information about the child from our database after a request by a parent or guardian.  However, if we have not received a refusal of entry by a parent or guardian within 48 hours after a reasonable attempt of notification, we will assume that participation in any sweepstakes or contest is acceptable to the parent or guardian.
Use of Collected Information.  Except for parties contracted to administer online activities, such as but not limited to contests, sweepstakes, or surveys, DDL does not willfully transfer, disclose, or share any information containing the personal identification of children to third parties.  Parties contracted to administer these online activities will have access to the information only to the extent needed to conduct the contest or sweepstakes.  No other use of collected information is allowed by such a third party.  If any artistic representation has been submitted to DDL for posting to our website, the art will only be identified by the username selected by the user unless further consent has been obtained.  The personal information obtained from children may be used in a variety of internal ways.  If the child has enrolled in one of our clubs or newsletters, they may receive periodic updates or special offers.  In addition, the information may be used to contact a child who is a contestant winner or survey participant in order to obtain needed information.
Log Data and Cookies. Generally, all information containing personally identifiable information is provided to DDL on a voluntary basis from you.  However, our servers may automatically detect information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, page views, or other statistical data (Log Data) related to our Site.  This information generally does not contain personally identifiable information, and this information generally is not linked to any personally identifiable information that you may provide DDL during your visit to our Site.  While we may disclose, sell, or distribute this statistical information about our Site to other parties, the information will not contain any information traceable to a single person or entity.  If for some reason this type of information becomes linked to you in a personally identifiable way, it will be treated as personal information under this policy and will not be disclosed to third parties.
Cookies may also be used by our website.  Cookies will not damage your computer or read information from your hard drive.  Cookies allow certain actions by a user to be remembered by a website.  We do not store any personal information in our cookies, and our cookies are not linked to any personal information stored in our database.  However, you can disable the use of cookies on your computer by changing the preferences of your web browser.
Parental Access of Personally Identifiable Information.  At any time, a parent or guardian may refuse to allow us to collect further information from their child, and the parent or guardian can request that all the information be removed from our database.  You may accomplish this by using any of the contact information disclosed below.
