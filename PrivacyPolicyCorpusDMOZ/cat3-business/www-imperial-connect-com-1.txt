Dear Customer,
As of 2011, Imperial Connector Systems has merged with Global Connector Technology (GCT).
For existing designs incorporating Imperial products, the Imperial part numbers will no longer be found when searching on this site.  There are two options:- Add an Imperial part number to the basket - Contact your local GCT sales office with the Imperial part number.
We look forward to working with you and thank you for your continued support.
