Privacy Training
Compliance Requires Training
HIPAA Compliance Calls for training of your employees and Privacy Work Group.  Any audits conducted by HHS or OCR will look for documented training of your organizations people and a lack of records follows the common rule of audits – if it’s not in writing, it didn’t happen.   But perhaps most importantly, your people need to be trained WHY following proper procedures is critical and WHAT the rules are.  People need to understand the motivation behind the rules to really get on board and PREVENT data breaches from happening.
Do you need privacy training?
We offer public Privacy Work Group Training. It’s a full-day program for training your Privacy Officer and Privacy Work Group. Can’t wait for our next public training? We are available to do on-site training as well for groups of 20 or more (smaller groups may also be trained but a flat fee will be charged).
