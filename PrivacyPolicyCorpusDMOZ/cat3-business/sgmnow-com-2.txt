TERMS-CONDITIONS-DISCLAIMER
The SGM website (the “Site”) consists of various web pages owned and operated by Security Guard Management (“SGM”).  SGM is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the “Terms”). Your use of SGMtraining.com, sgmnow.com and all website pages constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.  SGMtraining.com is an E-commerce Site providing more than 30 Online Security Officer Training Videos with tests.
INITIAL PROCEDURE
When you purchase the VOD program successfully, you will be granted immediate access to the training video library.  Within 24 business hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays), you will be mailed a customized link that you will be able to share with your employees to sign up for a free VOD membership under your account.  Do not share your personal login information with any employee, because your billing and credit card information will be able to be seen.  Only share with them the free link we send to you to distribute.  Using the free link will give them access to the training library, but they will not be able to see your billing or credit card information.  As long as your account remains valid, your employees’ access will remain active.  Employee sign up links are valid for thirty days.  At the end of thirty days if you wish them to continue, you will need to provide them with a new link (provided by SGM to you at no charge). VOD access is unlimited for all of your employees, up to 300 employees per month.  Each additional block of 300 employees is $99 per month (per each block of 300 monthly users).   SGM reserves the right to change as needed.  If any change is made, an advance notice will be sent to current active customers.

SUBSCRIPTIONS
