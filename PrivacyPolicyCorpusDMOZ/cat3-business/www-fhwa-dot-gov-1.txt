We employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties;
We train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures so that our personnel know what is required for compliance;
We physically secure the areas where we hold hard copies of the information we collect online;
We regularly back up the information we collect online to insure against loss;
We use technical controls to secure the information we collect online as appropriate, including but not limited to: Secure Socket Layer (SSL), encryption, firewalls, password protections;
We periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance; and
We employ external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts of outsiders to hack into, or cause harm to, the information in our systems.
Tampering with the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration Web site is against the law. If anyone tries to tamper with it, they may be punished under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
What are your rights under the Privacy Act of 1974?
The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in "systems of records (SOR)" (information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier). The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.
The Act's major provisions require agencies to:
Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR;
Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and
Allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it.
When the Federal Highway Administration collects information from you online that is subject to the Privacy Act (i.e., information to be kept in a SOR), we will provide you, through a link on the Web page from which we collect information, access to our Privacy Act Notice. This Privacy Act Notice will inform you what portion of the information is maintained and retrieved by your name or other personal identifier.
Each Privacy Act Notice will also notify you of the following:
The authority for and purpose and use of the collection of information subject to the Privacy Act;
Whether providing the information is voluntary or mandatory; and
The effects on you if you do not provide any or all of the requested information.
