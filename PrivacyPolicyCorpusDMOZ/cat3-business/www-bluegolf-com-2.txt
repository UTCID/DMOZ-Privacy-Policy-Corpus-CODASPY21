Privacy Policy
BlueGolf, LLC. and its related companies ("BlueGolf") recognize the
importance of protecting the privacy of Personal Information collected about its Users.
"Personal Information" includes, but is not limited to, usage data, along with
the name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card and salary
information of BlueGolf Users. Therefore, BlueGolf does not sell or otherwise disclose any
Personal Information. Nor does BlueGolf include in BlueGolf any functionality for
performing "reverse searches" to identify BlueGolf Users from their e-mail
addresses. However, BlueGolf reserves the right to analyze and utilize User data in order
to more effectively optimize the User experience and to present certain opportunities to
Users for their benefit. BlueGolf has adopted this Privacy Policy to inform BlueGolf Users
how it does collect, store, and use Personal Information. BlueGolf's intent is to balance
its legitimate business interests in collecting and using Personal Information against the
reasonable expectations of privacy of its Users.
Collection
BlueGolf collects Personal Information during e-mail and site registration, store
purchases, and other user registration processes. In addition, BlueGolf collects Personal
Information from BlueGolf Users in the form of usage data (for example, length of session,
pages viewed, etc.) for use as provided in paragraph 3 below.
Cookies
"Cookies" are pieces of information that BlueGolf transfers to the hard drives
of BlueGolf Users for record-keeping purposes. BlueGolf places Cookies with BlueGolf Users
visiting from advertising banners and hyperlinks on other websites to track the success of
a particular advertising campaign or marketing program. In addition, BlueGolf places
Cookies with BlueGolf Users to provide them with seamless access to BlueGolf, since
storing their user name and password in a Cookie eliminates the need to reenter that
information on every page. (Note: Browsers set to provide notice when a Cookie is placed
will prompt BlueGolf Users to accept or reject the Cookie.) The use of Cookies is an
industry standard and occurs at most major websites.
Usage
BlueGolf uses Personal Information for: developing enhancements to BlueGolf; marketing and
promotional purposes (for example, offering BlueGolf Users the opportunity to take
advantage of special promotions and acquire BlueGolf products); and evaluating BlueGolf
usage by analyzing usage data in the aggregate, but not with respect to any individual
BlueGolf User.
In addition, BlueGolf uses Personal Information to direct e-mail to BlueGolf Users who
provide their e-mail address in connection with specific promotions (for example,
receiving notice of winning a BlueGolf contest), or to direct e-mail regarding BlueGolf
updates and service enhancements to Users who opt in either during the BlueGolf
registration process or afterwards.
Third Parties
BlueGolf may provide demographic information in the aggregate regarding BlueGolf Users to
third parties in connection with BlueGolf advertising campaigns and marketing programs;
however, no Personal Information relating to any individual BlueGolf User is disclosed.
The only exception to this is if a User purchases an item at our online Store and we are
using a commerce partner to fulfill orders for that particular item. In the event that
sharing personal information is necessary under those circumstances, we only disclose that
which is required to deliver your order. No credit card information is disclosed.

Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any Personal
Information to BlueGolf or purchasing any products or services from BlueGolf.

BlueGolf only collects Personal Information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to
serve its legitimate business purposes, and it uses state-of-the-art security technology
to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of all Personal Information. In addition,
BlueGolf uses security measures in connection with the collection and transmission of
Personal Information during the BlueGolf registration process. Nonetheless, BlueGolf is
not responsible for any breach of its security or for the actions of any third parties
that may obtain any Personal Information.
