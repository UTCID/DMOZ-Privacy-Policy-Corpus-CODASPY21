Some of our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our products or company.

Furthermore, we encourage feedback and promise to take action against any linked site that, in our mind, exhibits behavior that falls outside standard practices.
Occasionally we run contests or other promotions on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address).
