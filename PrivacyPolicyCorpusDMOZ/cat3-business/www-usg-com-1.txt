USG Privacy Policy
USG Privacy Policy
Privacy
USG does collect certain information about the users of our web site. Collection and use of this information is governed by USG’s Privacy Policy which is set forth below:
Privacy Policy
USG Corporation ("USG") supports the highest standards of integrity for every online visitor. When you register at the USG web site, our goal is to respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets forth how we handle information we obtain from you and learn about you when you visit our web site, including:
The choices that are available to you regarding how the information is used and to whom it is disseminated; Your rights to access and correct or update your personally-identifiable information; and Our pledge to have reasonable security procedures that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.
If you live outside the United States (including in the European Economic Area (“EE”) and Switzerland (“CH”) collectively the “EEA/CH”), and you use this site or provide us with your personal information directly via this site, your information will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using this site or giving us your personal information, you are directly transferring your personal information to us in the United States. You agree and consent to our collection, transfer, and processing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for compliance with any data protection or privacy obligations in your jurisdiction when you use this site or provide us with your personal information. Regardless of where we transfer your information, we still protect your information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect and How We Use It
USG collects two types of information about you when you visit our site: personal information (including, by way of example only, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) and non-personal, aggregate information (such as information regarding the pages on our site that you have visited and your IP address).
Personally Identifiable Information
The only personally identifying information we collect and store about you is the information that you choose to provide to us.
Electronic Mail
We will also gather your personally-identifiable information when you send us an e-mail. We will use this information to respond to your e-mail. We may also use the information to send you notifications about our service.
Business Partners/Professional Visitors
Business partners and professional visitors requesting access to specialized content areas of this web site may be required to provide identifying information.
Sharing Your Information
We may share your personally-identifiable information within USG.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
The USG web site may collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit, such as type of browser, operating system, domain name, or IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers — the big computers that "serve" up web pages — automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit pages on USG's web site, our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. IP address information is used only to improve the service of the USG site, and is then discarded at the end of each session on our site. USG also collects information through "referrers" and various environmental variables. A "referrer" is information the web browser passes along to USG's web server that references the URL from which you came. "Environmental variables" include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed our web site, type of web browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the web site you left to visit USG, the names of the pages you visit while at our web site, and the Internet address of the web site you then visit. We collect all of this information to allow us to detect broad demographic trends, to provide information tailored to your interests and to enhance your experience on USG's web site. USG may store "referrer" information for a limited period of time prior to deleting this information. Analytical Tools: USG and our third party service providers collect information about you, your device, and your use of the web site through analytical tracking tools and methods (collectively, “Analytical Tools”). Analytical Tools collect information such as operating system type, IP address, browser type and language, mobile device ID, device hardware type, the web site or application visited or used before or after accessing USG’s web site, the parts of the web site accessed, the length of time spent on a page or using a feature, and access times for a webpage or feature. These Analytical Tools help us analyze how users use the web site, including what features they use, what pages they visit, and what other sites or applications they used prior to or after visiting the web site.
Profiling
To help us improve our web site and to ensure that we make every effort to provide you with information and offers that are of interest to you, we may merge your personally-identifiable information with click-stream data and other data we have (including cookies and offline data). We will provide notice of this, as well as an opportunity to opt-out of it, at the time and place of information collection and before data is entered on our system. We may also develop a non-identifiable profile on you based on the pages within our site that you visit.
Links
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected when you visit our web site.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
Special Policy Regarding Information from Children Under Thirteen
This web site is not targeted to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly request personally identifiable information from any child under the age of 13 without parental consent. When we do receive such information, we delete it as soon as we discover it and do not use it or share it with third parties.
