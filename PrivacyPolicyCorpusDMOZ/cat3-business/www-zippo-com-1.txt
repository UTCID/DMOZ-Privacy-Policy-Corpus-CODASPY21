4. PERSONALIZED LIGHTERS - PRODUCT CUSTOMIZATION – USA CONSUMERS ONLY
a) These are ZIPPO’s guidelines for a personal photo or artwork (hereafter “artwork”) intended to be placed on a Zippo lighter or other product. Consumers that submit artwork for use by ZIPPO to create a customized product (products may include lighters, hand warmers, candle lighters, etc.) are responsible for making sure the proposed artwork complies with these Guidelines AND all applicable law. Prior to accepting an order, users will be required to confirm the photo or art is their intellectual property to use. ZIPPO does not knowingly accept any artwork that infringes another person’s intellectual property rights. If you believe that artwork on a ZIPPO lighter infringes your intellectual property rights or those rights of another person or entity, please email us at: legal@zippo.comb) QUESTIONABLE MATERIAL & PROHIBITED ARTWORKThe consumer takes full responsibility for any photo or artwork presented to ZIPPO. ZIPPO reserves the right to review it to determine if, to the extent it is possible to do so, the artwork can be used without violation of some other person’s intellectual property rights or applicable law. However, the fact that we accept the artwork does not mean ZIPPO or any other person or entity excuses you from your obligation.
Photos or artwork that appears to be acceptable for use will be accepted. Content that appears to be not acceptable will be rejected, subject to the consumer providing proof of right to use. c) GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PHOTOS OR ARTWORKBelow are some general types of photos or artwork (hereafter “artwork”) that are not acceptable for decoration of ZIPPO products: Whether artwork is acceptable for decoration on a ZIPPO lighter or other product is determined solely by ZIPPO. Summary of artwork that will not be acceptable:
Artwork that may infringe the copyright of a third party
Artwork that may infringe the trademark of a third party
Artwork that infringes the Right of Publicity of a third party
Names, logos, pictures, or other intellectual property of musical groups or musical artists
Sports teams names, logos or other intellectual property of colleges/universities, clubs, or organizations, such as New York Yankees, Real Madrid, Notre Dame, or a non-profit organization – e.g. the Red Cross
Trademarks, names, or logos of companies. For example, you cannot use the name of a company such as ZIPPO or a company logo such as the ZIPPO logo
Copying of an existing piece of artwork, cartoon, photograph or video frame. Changing a piece of artwork by rearranging the elements of the artwork is not acceptable
Photos, logos, caricatures, or other artwork depicting celebrities or other third parties. Just because you take a photograph does not give you the right to use that photograph on merchandise, even if you digitally manipulate the photograph
Inappropriate content or nudity
Artwork that exploits minors
Artwork that is obscene or vulgar, contains offensive remarks or harasses, threatens, defames or abuses others, or is racist or Nazi
Artwork that depicts violence, is obscene, abusive, fraudulent or threatening
Artwork that glamorizes drug use or alcohol abuse; or
Material that is generally offensive or in bad taste, as determined by ZIPPO in its sole discretion
The list is not exhaustive. It is only a general guideline for you to consider when you submit artwork to ZIPPO.If your artwork is deemed by ZIPPO to be unacceptable, a refund of the purchase price will be made as a credit to the credit card you used to make the purchase. d) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSDoes ZIPPO own the rights to my artwork?If you submit artwork to be placed on lighters that you intend keep or gift to someone else, you retain all rights to your artwork but do grant a limited, non-exclusive license to ZIPPO to allow ZIPPO to place your artwork on its lighters or other product and ship your products to you. If it does not have a copyright notice, is it ok to use?Almost all works are protected by copyright, even if they do not have a copyright notice. Therefore, you need to obtain written permission to use any artwork that you did not create.Is it ok to use an image I found on the internet? No. Simply because an image (artwork, photograph, etc.) is on the internet does not mean that it is in the public domain or available for your use. You cannot use the work unless the author of the work has explicitly granted you a license to use the work or it is in the public domain. Further, a person who posts an image on the internet and claims that you are free to use it may not have had the right to post the image in the first place. Thus, your use of the image may violate the rights of the actual copyright owner or a person’s right of publicity or right of privacy.If I took a photograph of a celebrity or a company logo can I use it to make merchandise? No. Taking a photo of a person, company building, product, brand, or logo does not give you the right to sell merchandise featuring that photograph. There are two distinct intellectual property rights in a photograph: (1) the rights in the photograph itself and (2) the rights in the subject of the photograph, such as the product or person shown in it. In order to order merchandise with the photograph, you will need to obtain explicit permission from the celebrity. I based my artwork on the artwork of a third party, is that ok? Not generally speaking. It depends on what you mean by “based it on.” Artwork derived from the previous work of another will likely violate the rights of the owner of the previous artwork. If you are creating a design that is based on the work of someone else, you will probably need to obtain permission from the owner of the original artwork prior to using it. If the other artwork just inspired you to create a new piece of artwork that is truly new artwork then you should not be violating the copyright of the other person. However, you should consult with an attorney before using any artwork based on the artwork of another person. Is parody ok?Maybe. ZIPPO generally does not accept parody artwork and will not automatically accept such artwork for use on its lighters or other products. Often we require you to obtain an opinion from your attorney that such use is legally acceptable. I am using Clip Art, is it ok?No. Most clip art, photo collections, or graphic programs contain a license agreement. The license agreement sets forth the specific permissible uses for the clip art. In most instances the license does not grant you the right to use the clip art commercially, for the sale of merchandise. You should consult the clip art license agreement and your attorney to determine whether you can use the images. e. RETURNS ZIPPO inspects all personalized product ordered on any Site for manufacturing errors or product defects. If you believe there is a quality issue with your product, you may return it in as-new condition and in its original packaging for a prompt exchange for the same item, or immediate full refund of the product purchase price. Understandably, personalized products cannot be accepted for return unless there is a manufacturing error or product defect. All refunds or exchanges must be made within 30 days of receipt. ZIPPO wants your personalized order to arrive just the way it was ordered by you. Please review your personalization information carefully before submitting your order. ZIPPO will not accept cancellations or changes to orders once they are placed as they are immediately sent to production. If you have purchased ZIPPO products from another online retailer or store, please contact that retailer directly for instructions.
5. ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES AND LINKS

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS SHALL ONLY APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. 6.2 To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, Zippo Manufacturing Company aggregate liability, and the aggregate liability of our subsidiaries, affiliates and officers, to you or any third party is limited to One Thousand U.S. Dollars ($1000).
