Company founded by Georg Neumann
CMV 3
First Condenser Microphone
The 'Neumann Bottle', the first ever mass produced condenser microphone. Diameter: 9 cm, height: 40 cm, weight: 3 kg. Telefunken, a subsidiary of AEG, took on the marketing rights to this Neumann microphone.
Discover
AM 31
Recording Machine For Wax
The AM 31 was the successor to Neumann’s first disk cutting lathe AM 29, which was still belt driven. The AM 31’s innovative oil-damped direct drive ensured an extremely even rotation.
R 21
Portable Recording Machine
The R 21 was a portable disk recorder for electronic news gathering. While stationary disk cutting lathes engraved the signal in heavy wax disks, the R 21 used gelatine foil as its recording medium.
Level Recorder
Logarithmic Level Recorder
Early on, Neumann also developed measuring equipment such as this Level Recorder, which was able to draw frequency response curves on wax paper.
MM 2
Measuring Microphone
Neumann’s first measurement microphone. Its tube amplifier was based on the U 47’s, but instead of a large diaphragm capsule it used a tiny high-precision condenser capsule on a long neck to avoid reflections from the microphone body.
Discover

Stereo Microphone
Neumann’s first large diaphragm stereo microphone SM 69 was still tube based. Polar patterns were selectable for each capsule individually via the power supply.
Discover
U 64
Miniature Microphone

Discover
KM 73
Miniature Microphone for Modulation Lead Powering
The KM 73 was an omnidirectional small diaphragm microphone with solid state electronics. It was powered via T-power, P48 phantom power had not yet been invented.
Discover
KM 74
Miniature Microphone for Modulation Lead Powering
The KM 74 the successor to the KTM, Neumann’s first transistorized microphone. It used the same cardioid capsule as the KM 64 and KM84, but the grounding scheme of its T-powered circuit necessitated a different capsule head design.
Discover
KM 75
Miniature Microphone for Modulation Lead Powering
The KM 75 was a cardioid microphone for short distances, e.g. in speech applications. Its capsule had a built-in low cut to compensate for the proximity effect. Like all KM 70 microphones, the KM 75 was T-powered.
Discover
KM 66
Switchable Miniature Microphone
The KM 66 was a small diaphragm microphone with switchable patterns similar to the KM 56 but with two cardioid capsules with mylar diaphragms. The KM 66 was to remain Neumann’s last tube microphone design for almost 30 years.
Discover
KM 83
Miniature Microphone for Phantom Powering
The KM 83 was the omnidirectional model of the KM 80 series, which introduced a technology, which, due to its many advantages, soon became the new standard: P48 phantom power.
Discover
KM 84
Miniature Microphone for Phantom Powering
The small diaphragm cardioid microphone KM 84 was built until 1992 and remains one of the most popular Neumann classics. Its even frequency response and consistent pickup pattern make it a sought-after microphone for all genres.
Discover
KM 85
Miniature Microphone for Phantom Powering
The KM 85 was a cardioid microphone like the KM 84 but with a low cut built into the capsule to compensate for the proximity effect. The KM 85 was thus optimized for short distances as are typical in speech applications.
Discover
KML
Clip-on Microphone
Neumann’s first Lavalier microphone. Its solid state amplifier could be battery powered and used with wireless transmitters of the day, such as the Sennheiser SK 1007.
Discover
KM 76
Switchable Miniature Microphone
The KM 76 was the solid state successor to the KM 66 small diaphragm tube microphone. The KM 76 offered switchable patterns (omni, cardioid, figure-8) and operated T-powered.
Discover
U 87 i
Switchable Studio Microphone
The Neumann U 87 is probably the best-known and most frequently used studio microphone the world over. Its smooth and refined sound is as iconic as its elegant exterior design. The U 87 is the standard microphone for speech and vocals.
Discover
KM 86
Switchable Miniature Microphone
Like the KM 76, the KM 86 was a transistorized successor to the KM 66 small diaphragm tube microphone. The KM 86, however, was developed for P48 phantom power, introduced a few years earlier by Neumann – and soon the world standard.
Discover
KMA (1968)
Clip-on Microphone
The KMA (not to be confused with today’s KM A modular microphone system!) was an improved Lavalier microphone with an omnidirectional capsule and a detached amplifier. It ran on batteries or phantom power.
Discover
U 77
Switchable Studio Microphone (Mod. Lead Powering)
Like the U 87, the U 77 was a solid state successor to Neumann’s classic tube microphone U 67. But instead of phantom power – which was not yet a studio standard – the U 77 operated on T-power.
Discover
KM 88
Switchable Miniature Microphone
The KM 88 was a multipattern small diaphragm microphone (omni, cardioid, figure-8) with FET electronics, similar to the KM 86. However, it used the same nickel capsules previously found in the KM 56 tube microphone.
Discover
SM 69 fet
Stereo Microphone (Transistor)
With the beginning of the new decade, Neumann’s large diaphragm stereo microphone SM 69, too, was converted to solid state electronics. Nonetheless it still required a dedicated power supply due to its remote pattern control.
Discover
KMS 85
Handheld Microphone
Neumann’s first handheld vocal microphone had an unusual shape, but it proved that clever engineering could render condenser microphones stage-ready.
Discover
SRM 84
Long Neck Stage Microphone
The successor to the SRM 64 long neck stage microphone. Instead of a tube amplifier the SRM 84 had a solid state circuit hidden in the lower part of the stand tube.
Discover
U 47 fet (1972)
Studio Microphone
By the early 70s Neumann’s tube microphone U 47 was legendary among seasoned engineers, and many wished for a direct solid state successor. The U 47 fet never quite filled those giant footprints, but was eventually (re)discovered as a classic in its own right.
Discover
