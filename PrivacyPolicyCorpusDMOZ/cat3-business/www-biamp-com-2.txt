You and Biamp agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Biamp agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.Federal Arbitration ActYou and Biamp agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.Notice; Informal Dispute ResolutionYou and Biamp agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

Our notice to you will be sent to the email address you provided at registration and will include (x) our name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking.  If you and Biamp cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Biamp may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.ProcessExcept for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 10 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Biamp agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Portland, Oregon, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Service of Portland, which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.  You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.Authority of ArbitratorAs limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable Arbitration Service of Portland rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.Rules of Arbitration Service of PortlandThe rules of Arbitration Service of Portland and additional information about Arbitration Service of Portland are available on the Arbitration Service of Portland website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of Arbitration Service of Portland or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of Arbitration Service of Portland and any claim that the rules of Arbitration Service of Portland are unfair or should not apply for any reason.SeverabilityIf any term, clause or provision of this Section 17 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 17 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 17.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

Any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon.Modifications to the ServicesBiamp reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any content, features or portions thereof at any time without prior notice and without obligation or liability to you. You agree that Biamp will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof.TerminationNotwithstanding any of these Terms, Biamp reserves the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to use the Services, or any portion of thereof, and to block or prevent your future access to and use of the Services or any portion thereof.SeverabilityIf any term, clause or provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
