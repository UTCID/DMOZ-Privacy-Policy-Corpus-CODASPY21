1. AsiaPaperMarkets is a Venue
AsiaPaperMarkets acts as a venue to allow users who comply with AsiaPaperMarkets’s policies to offer, sell and buy goods. AsiaPaperMarkets is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, AsiaPaperMarkets has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. AsiaPaperMarkets does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. AsiaPaperMarkets cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.
Consequently, AsiaPaperMarkets does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.
AsiaPaperMarkets cannot guarantee the true identity, age, nationality, or sense of humor of a user. AsiaPaperMarkets encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners via the tools available on the Sites. You may also want to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.
You agree that AsiaPaperMarkets is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on AsiaPaperMarkets.
