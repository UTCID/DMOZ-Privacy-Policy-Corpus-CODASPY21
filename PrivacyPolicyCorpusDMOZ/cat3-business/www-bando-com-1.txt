Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: 1/14/2020
We Are Committed to Helping You Make the Most of Your Time Online Within a Trusted Environment.
Ban.do (“We,” “Our,” or “Us”)  respect your privacy and are letting you know about Our online privacy policies. This Privacy Policy discloses how We collect, protect, use, and share information gathered about you on www.bando.com and webpages sharing the same domain (the “Site”). We hope that this disclosure will help increase your confidence in Our site and enhance your experience on the internet.  Your use of the Site indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Our Terms of Use.  Furthermore, for Site visitors located in the European Union, please see Our EU Privacy Policy.
Types of Information We Collect and How We Collect It
The majority of the product and service information posted on Our Site is offered without Our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can navigate the Site and view much of Our content without providing personal information to Us.
Information You Provide
There are a few activities on Our Site where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like entering a contest or sweepstakes, giveaway, making a purchase, requesting a catalog, newsletter or other information, registering on Our Site, filling out a survey or questionnaire, or contacting us. We do not market to, seek to solicit information from, or knowingly collect information from children under 13. When We collect personally identifiable information, you will know because you will have to provide that information to us. For most activities, We collect only your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code  , birth date   and any other relevant information necessary to complete your requests. For example, when you make a purchase, we also collect your billing address, your phone number, and credit card information. If you visit Our pages on social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter, we may collect both personally-identifiable and non-personally-identifiable information.  For example, if you ask a customer service question through our Facebook page, we will receive your username along with your question and will use that information to respond to your question.  We will store personally identifiable information so long as We have a legitimate business purpose to do so in accordance with applicable law.   We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as Site visits, in order to improve Our services.
We do not market to, seek to solicit information from, or knowingly collect information from children under 13 nor is the Site is not intended for use by children.   Consistent with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), if We learn that We have received any information directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving his or her parent's verified consent, We will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian if known) to inform the child that he or she cannot use the Site and subsequently We will delete information associated with the child.
Information Collected from You with Technology
Our Site collects some information about you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you visit Our Site, We automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information from your browser, such as your Internet service provider's address, the web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on Our Site. This information is not personally identifiable. If you visit Our Site on a mobile device, We collect information about the device, including the operating system and your location. Our Site uses information collected through technology to make Our Site more interesting and useful to you, help Us with usability on Our Site to make your life easier, help Us to ensure that Our Site works properly on your device, and help Us generally improve the content and layout of Our Site, notify you about updates to Our Site, and contact you for marketing purposes.
Description of Cookies, Tracking Pixels and Other Technologies and How We Use Them
Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. These pieces of information allow the websites to remember important information that will make your use of those sites easier and more helpful. Our Site and other websites use cookies and other similar technologies, including tracking pixels and clear GIFs, for a variety of purposes. They enable Us to identify your device when you move between different websites and applications so that We can help you find products you might be most interested in or serve targeted advertising and marketing offers to you.
As a result of your accessing Our Site, We may use third party cookies and other technologies and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on Our Site. Some of this information will be used to market our products to you on third-party websites.
We contract with one or more third-party service partners to provide Us with a data collection and reporting service. When you access Our Site, a third-party service partner may use cookies and other technologies on Our behalf and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on Our Site. Such data collection may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and We may share this aggregated data with Our affiliates, agents, and business partners, such as Google Analytics. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe Our market to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Edge) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many of Our features that make your web experience more efficient.
The Type of Security We Provide
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with Our users is of utmost concern to us. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption across Our Site to protect your information.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.  As such, We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.
There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the web so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information.  You should use caution when using public Wi-Fi, which can make your personal information available to others if not properly secured.
How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect
We use personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, if you contact Us for help, We will use the information to contact you. If you place an order, We use your information to ship those goods to you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a game or contest. Information We collect is also used to send you e-mail updates or news, information on products and services, discounts, upcoming events and newsletters about Our brand(s) and other information we think you will find valuable, periodic mailings, and in some instances telephone contact.
