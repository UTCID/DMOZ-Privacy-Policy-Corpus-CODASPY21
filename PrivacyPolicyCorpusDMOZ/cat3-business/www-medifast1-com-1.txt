This information may be used by Medifast to evaluate use of the Application and make enhancements to Medifast's customer experience. The Sites provide weight loss management tools and related information and are intended only to assist users in their personal weight loss, health, wellness and fitness related efforts (the foregoing together as "Health Regimen"). Medifast is not a medical organization and our personnel cannot give you medical advice or diagnosis. Nothing contained in is or should be construed as such advice or diagnosis.

You are urged and advised to seek the advice of a physician before beginning any Health Regimen. The Sites are intended for use only by healthy adult individuals. The Sites are not intended for use by minors, pregnant women, or individuals with any type of health condition. Such individuals are specifically warned to seek professional medical advice prior to initiating any form of Health Regimen.

If you choose to participate in any Health Regimen in connection with the Sites, you do so of your own free will and accord, knowingly and voluntarily assuming all risks associated with such Health Regimen, including any risks of property damage, bodily injury, or death even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction, or negligence of Medifast or by the action, inaction, or negligence of others. Certain Health Regimens promoted by the Sites may pose risks even to those who are currently in good health. Your use of the Sites does not constitute or create a doctor-patient, therapist-patient or other healthcare professional relationship between you and Medifast. Success stories posted by users or Medifast on our Sites may not represent typical or even accurate results obtained from any particular Health Regimen. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Medifast has no and assumes no obligation or liability associated with the accuracy, reliability or effectiveness of any Health Regimen recommendation contained in any success stories on the Sites. The Sites are intended to provide you with information to encourage you to support your wellness and fitness activities. Some of the Sites may be aimed at tracking your physical movements and sleep activity ("Activity Tracking Services"). These Activity Tracking Services rely on sensors and/or GPS functionality that track your movement or body at rest. The data and information provided by the Activity Tracking Services are intended to be a representation of your activity, but may not be completely accurate, including with respect to step, sleep, speed, distance, or calorie data. By using Activity Tracking Services, you acknowledge and agree that Medifast is not responsible or liable for any inaccuracy in such data. For more information, you should review the FAQ available at https://www.medifast1.com/faqs/general-information. 4. USER COMMENTS, FEEDBACK, AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS.

Subject to the foregoing, the owner of a Comment retains any and all Rights that may exist in such Submission. You also warrant that, to the extent you are not the exclusive holder of all applicable Rights in a Comment, any third party holder of any such rights, including moral rights in such Comment, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license stated above. You further acknowledge that Medifast and its applicable successors and assigns shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Comments for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Comments. You also permit any user of the Sites to access, display, view, store or reproduce any Comment that you have made available in any part of the Sites for their personal use.

This Agreement shall not be interpreted as granting any licenses or transferring any rights in any Content except those expressly granted herein. Any rights not expressly granted in the Content are hereby reserved.

You are not permitted to use any Marks without the prior written consent of Medifast or the applicable mark owner or licensor. 6. DMCA COMPLIANCE AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT NOTICES. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") permits anyone who believes in good faith that material available via the Sites infringes their copyright (a "Claimant") to send to our agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement ("Agent") a written notice requesting that we remove or block access to the infringing material ("Notice"). The Notice must include the following information: (i)     identification of the copyrighted work that is claimed to have been infringed; (ii)
a description of where on the Sites the allegedly infringing material is located; (iii)
information, if possible, sufficient to permit us to notify the individual who posted the allegedly infringing material; (iv)
Claimant's address, telephone number, and email address; (v)
a statement by Claimant that he or she has a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (vi)
a statement by Claimant, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notice is accurate and that Claimant is the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and (vii)
the electronic or physical signature of the Claimant. The DMCA permits anyone who believes in good faith that a Notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly made against them to send our Agent a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see www.loc.gov/copyright). Notices and counter-notices should be sent to our Agent at: Medifast, Inc.
Attn: Senior Staff Counsel 100 International Drive 18th Floor Baltimore, MD 21202 Responses to Notices will be made in accordance with the requirements of the DMCA and within Medifast's sole discretion. 7.

These obligations and prohibitions continue even after any termination or cancellation of your relationship with Medifast. Medifast reserves the right to cancel or refuse to process any orders within its sole discretion, including but not limited to orders that Medifast feels may be placed with an intent to resell and/or distribute. 17. TERM AND TERMINATION; SURVIVAL. This Agreement applies to all access to and use of the Sites. It will continue as long as any Visitor or user accesses or uses the Sites.

No waiver hereunder shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. No writing that is required to be executed in order to be effective hereunder shall be effective unless executed by a duly authorized representative of such party. This Agreement shall not be construed as creating a joint venture or other business relationship. The construction of this Agreement shall not take into consideration the party who drafted or whose representative drafted any portion of this Agreement, and no canon of construction shall be applied that resolves ambiguities against the drafter of a document.
