Privacy
We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying fully with the UKs Data Protection Act 1998. We are registered under the Act. We cannot collect personal information, whether by email or forms or any other method, from anyone under 14 years of age.
We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. We may use such data held on our servers for statistical analysis and release anonymous data which cannot be traced back to any individual.
By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to us passing on personal data if we should transfer our customer database to a third party who acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock in our company or our website services, whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise (or to an interested third party as part of the due diligence process before concluding such a sale). If at any time you wish to withdraw such consent you may do so by contacting us at the address stated below.
No personally identifiable information will be passed to any third party without your consent unless we are required to do so by law. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us on one of our group companies. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of your support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access
