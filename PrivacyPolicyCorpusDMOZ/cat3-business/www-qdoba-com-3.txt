Please note that there are changes to how Qdoba Catering Rewards points are earned and redeemed. Please see “Use of Rewards Program with Catering Orders” and “Participants in the (prior) Catering Rewards-Only Program” sections below.The Qdoba Rewards program is valid only at participating Qdoba Mexican Eats® or Qdoba Mexican Grill® locations. Upon registering, you receive credit towards the program (points) through qualifying purchases made at participating Qdoba restaurant locations, which points can be used to redeem menu items at participating locations. The following terms apply:Points are non-transferable or devisable, and may not be combined with other members’ accounts.Points are only credited to your account when presenting your registered digital or physical Qdoba Rewards Card or Mobile App QR Code in the restaurant or at the time a catering order is placed or, where allowed, by entering a Claim ID received in restaurant to a registered account on qdoba.com within 30 days of a visit.Specific point values and redeemable awards may vary by participating market or restaurant. Points are awarded for qualifying transactions based on your Tier Level, any completed Qdoba Mobile Challenges (if offered), and other circumstances, at Qdoba’s sole discretion.There are four Tier Levels. Your Tier Level is based on qualifying in restaurant and catering transactions using the Mobile App, Digital Card or Physical Rewards Card accrued by the member at a participating restaurant within the preceding 12 month periods, beginning on the date you registered for Qdoba Rewards.When points are used to redeem menu items claimed online or in-store, some additional charges may apply, such as for add-ons or extras (which will be explained at time of redemption/purchase).If you fail to participate in a qualifying transaction for 12 consecutive months, all unused points and rewards expire.Points and rewards cannot be redeemed for cash and have no cash value. Points can only be redeemed for qualifying items determined by Qdoba, and may not be redeemed for items including, but not limited to: discounted items, promotional items, alcohol, tax, tip, Q-Cash gift cards and items whose value is offset in whole or in part by a coupon.Users are not eligible to earn points for alcohol and gift card (Qcash) sales and are only applied to the pretax total of your order.Points are not earned, and may not be redeemed, on orders placed through a third-party delivery service.Points may not be sold or transferred, and may not be combined with other rewards or transferred to any other Qdoba Rewards account. When using the Mobile App, you may redeem points for rewards and then gift those rewards to another participant via email or text(this functionality is not available via the Qdoba.com website).You will be asked to opt in to location tracking services (in order to determine the closest restaurant, receive geo-targeted promotions or other marketing messages, and for internal data analysis and other purposes), but will be able to modify the Mobile App settings to opt out of tracking. When using the Mobile App, you will be also asked to opt in to receive “push” notifications in order to receive account information, promotions and other marketing messages, but will be able to modify push notification settings within your device’s operating system. When using the Qdoba.com website, you will also be asked to provide an email address to receive account- or transaction-related emails and to opt in if you wish to also receive exclusive offers, information about new products, and restaurant and local event information.

Once your birthday is set, this cannot be changed. You may be offered the opportunity to participate in individual Qdoba Rewards Challenges and other offers that may have specific terms and conditions.If you order items that qualify for both redeemable points and “Tier Benefit Perks”, the Tier Benefit Perk will generally be redeemed and deducted from the check first, unless the rewards value is higher.You may be offered incentives to provide feedback through push notifications or embedded in the app (also known as the mobile app inbox) as well as through push notification and email. Any incentives awarded will be added directly to your Rewards account or sent via coupon offers within the mobile app or via email.Use of Rewards Program with Catering Orders: Qdoba Rewards members can also earn Qdoba Catering Order Rewards Points (“Catering Points”) on Qdoba catering orders. These Catering Points are tallied and counted separately from general rewards points. Catering points may only be redeemed for catering discounts, free entrees, and Qdoba gift cards, and only at certain locations, and may not be used toward online orders at this time.In addition, the following terms apply to catering orders:You must have at least one catering transaction within the 12 month period following your registration or first catering transaction and each anniversary thereof (“annual catering transaction”) in order to continue to earn or redeem points based on dollars spent on catering orders or to redeem those catering transaction points. If you fail to have an annual catering transaction, all catering points will be removed from your account.You need to accrue a minimum of 1,000 catering reward points within that 12 month time period to redeem points for catering rewards discounts or Qdoba gift cards; a minimum of 100 points is needed to redeem for free entrée reward. As with general rewards points, catering points cannot be redeemed for cash and have no cash value.Catering Discounts cannot be stacked, only one may be used per catering order.Participants in the (prior) Catering Rewards-Only Program: If you registered for the Qdoba Catering Rewards program prior to 11/20/2016 and transfer into the new program after 12/5/2016 any existing accrued catering points will be deposited into your new Rewards Account, Triple points and 1400 bonus points only apply to in store reward points. NOT Catering Rewards points. Guests will receive 1400 bonus rewards points, and their rewards points balance will be tripled. Any existing Catering Reward point balance will simply carry over. i.e. guest has 1500 catering points pre 11/20 – 1500 points will appear in their account when they log in after 12/5.You will be assigned a Tier Level based on your qualifying transactions since your anniversary date of joining the program. If you had already registered in the Qdoba Rewards Program, your catering points will transfer, and no further action is required by you.The Qdoba Rewards program may be changed or discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of Qdoba.
