How do I order checks for the first time?
You can order personal checks using the Services link under the Customer Service menu in Regions Online Banking or by visiting your local branch.
If you are ordering personal checks through Online Banking, the check personalization and mailing label information fields will be locked and pre-filled from your current records to ensure your account security and protection. The check starting number will default to 101 on first-time orders, but this field may be changed.
Business check orders are currently not available in Online Banking, but the team at Harland Clarke Business Solutions can assist business customers with computer and laser checks, compatible software, three-to-a-page checks, deposit solutions and other checking needs. Call 1-877-275-4427.
