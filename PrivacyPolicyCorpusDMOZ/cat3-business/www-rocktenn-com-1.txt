Personal Data and How We Collect It
Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
We collect personal data from you that is necessary and appropriate based on the type of relationship we have with you. This data may include your name or other identifier, your contact information and the content of any requests or other communication from you to us. For example, a job applicant may provide details about their education or employment history.
We collect some personal data through your interactions with us, such as completing a visitor log when you visit one of our facilities.
Some personal data may be created by WestRock itself. Examples may include an employee identification number, department name/number, and WestRock email address.
WestRock may obtain some information, where lawful to do so, from public sources or third parties, including benefit providers, other colleagues, government, tax or law enforcement agencies, customers, suppliers, reference and vetting service providers and others.
Finally, we collect some personal data through our IT equipment, software and communications systems which may be used by you, as well as software used to assist with the performance and administration of human resources, benefits, staffing and other related functions.
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 18 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 18 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.
Our Legal Basis for Collecting and Processing Personal Data
We will only collect and process personal information where we have a lawful basis to do so. This is particularly important under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal basis under GDPR may be different for different types of processing of personal data, and may fall into one of the following categories:
“Legitimate Interests” – Those pursued by WestRock as a business, except where such interests are overridden by the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject. For example, we may rely on this legal basis when processing personal information to ensure IT security, or to communicate with business contacts.
“Performance of a Contract” - We may rely on this legal basis in dealing with the personal information of employees with an employment contract, for example. It also applies to pre-contractual data exchanges such as job application information.
“Compliance with WestRock’s Legal Obligations” - For example, we are usually required by law to report employee payroll information to the relevant tax authority.
“Vital Interests” – We may process some health-related personal information in order to protect the data subject or another person, such as during an epidemic.
“Consent of the Data Subject” – We may process some personal data based on the specific, freely given and clearly documented consent of the data subject.
Transfer of Personal Data Within WestRock
The WestRock group operates in many countries and may share your information among its affiliate companies including those that operate in countries outside your own. WestRock has put in place standard contractual clauses between these companies to ensure your personal information is protected, as described in this Notice.
Transfer of Personal Data Outside WestRock
Personal data may be transferred to our outsourced service providers, including those located in another country. In these circumstances WestRock will, as required by applicable law, put in place appropriate technical, organizational, contractual and/or other lawful measures to protect your personal data.
WestRock may transfer personal data to public authorities when we are required by law to do so.
WestRock does not, and will not, sell personal data.
Retention of Personal Data
We will retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes provided in this Notice or to meet other legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements.
We may keep an anonymized form of personal data, which will no longer refer to an individual person or have personally identifying information, for statistical purposes without time limits, to the extent that we have a legitimate and lawful interest in doing so.
Security of Personal Data
WestRock is committed to protecting the personal data you share with us or that we process. We have implemented technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The measures include:
Logical Access Control
Personnel Security
Network Security
Physical Access Control
Hardware Management
Back-up and Recovery
Vendor Security
Security Reviews
Monitoring
WestRock may monitor use of its physical facilities, its informational and communications systems and other assets. ‘Monitoring’ includes without limitation intercepting, blocking, recording or otherwise accessing systems and processes whether on a full-time or occasional basis, as permitted by applicable law. It may also include the use of CCTV cameras at various physical locations on and around our facility premises, as permitted by applicable law.
Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data
If you are covered by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Californian Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) you have the right to view your personal information, change it, or request to have it deleted. In particular, you may:
request copies of your personal data. To do so, please contact the WestRock Global Privacy Office. We reserve the right to request that you provide proof of your identity.
request that we correct any inaccurate and/or incomplete personal data.
withdraw consent to the processing of personal data at any time. Such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your prior given consent. Please note that if consent is withdrawn, you may not be able to benefit from certain service features for which the processing of personal data is essential.
request that we stop processing, including automated processing and profiling, of your personal information. In the case of computerized or technology driven automated processing, you may request human intervention.
request that we erase your personal data. We will comply with such requests unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so. For example, we may be required to keep some payroll information for tax reporting purposes.
lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority. We suggest contacting us about any questions or complaints in relation to how we process personal information. However, based on applicable law you may also have the right to contact the relevant data protection authority in your country, state or jurisdiction directly.
WestRock will not discriminate against you based on your decision to exercise your rights.

If we change our privacy policies, we will update this Notice.
