Thank you for visiting the Wisconsin Oven Web Site (the “Site”). In light of the complexities governing the use and operation of web sites, we have set forth below a series of Access and Use Terms (“SATS”) that apply to your access to and use of the Site. Compliance with and acceptance of the SATS are required in order for you to have access to and use of the Site. Please read the SATS very carefully. We hope that you will understand that, in the complex legal world of the internet, access and use terms are required. We have also included below, as part of the SATS, an identification of Wisconsin Oven’s agent for receipt of notice regarding copyright claims and other communications regarding the Site. If you do not agree with or do not accept any of the SATS, please immediately exit the Site and refrain from further access.
Thank you for your understanding. We hope that you enjoy the Site and find it useful. Also, please keep in mind that information provided on this site and via linked sites is not for the purposes of seeking or encouraging investment unless specifically designated as such.
1. Limited License
As described below, your compliance with the SATS provides a limited, terminable license regarding access to and use of the Site Contents. “Site Contents” or “Contents” means images, text, information, sounds, interactive features, links, and other features of the Site. “Site Code” means any and all underlying elements of the Site, including, but not limited to source code, object code, and other sets of statements or instructions that relate to the operation or functions of the Site.
You agree:
a) Not to alter the image and text in any manner or use them in a manner specifically prohibited by these SATs or by the instructions in the Site.
b) To use the copies for your own informational purposes only. For example, unless expressly authorized by Wisconsin Oven, you agree not to place any Site Contents on a network and will not use any Site Contents to advertise or otherwise promote any products or services not provided by Wisconsin Oven.
c) To place the following notation on your copies: “© 2016 - Wisconsin Oven. All Rights Reserved. See Wisconsin Oven Web Site for Access and Use Terms for additional information and conditions of use.”
d) Wisconsin Oven may, solely in its own discretion and without advance notice, revoke the limited license regarding all of the Site Contents or with respect to specific images, texts or other Site features. If requested by Wisconsin Oven, you agree to cease using and/or destroy any copies of the subject Content.
e) Unless expressly permitted in writing from Wisconsin Oven, you will not frame, link, or commercially exploit either the Site, Site Contents or the Site Code unless specifically authorized by Wisconsin Oven to do so.
f) You are responsible for ensuring that other parties that have access to the Site or Site Contents through your system or with your permission agree to the SATS.
2. Ownership of Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Proprietary Rights
All trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade dress, copyrights, patent rights and other proprietary rights in or associated with the Site, the Site Contents, and Site Code are the properties of Wisconsin Oven or its licensors. Nothing in these SATS or any Site Contents shall convey an ownership interest or a non-terminable license in any Site Contents or any Site Code.
3. Submissions and User Grant of License
Wisconsin Oven is pleased to hear from its customers and Site users. We welcome your input. However, due to legal requirements, we cannot provide compensation for, agree to consider, or agree in advance to keep confidential, any submission of creative ideas, disclosures of inventions, other disclosures of potentially useful information, or submissions of any other content. In order to avoid confusion and unmanageable situations, all content submitted by you via the Site or through any contact information provided in the Site (e.g., addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, links) is provided with a paid-up, perpetual, non-exclusive license, effective everywhere, to Wisconsin Oven to consider, retain, copy, use, publish, modify, disclose and otherwise exploit the content, at Wisconsin Oven’s sole discretion. Wisconsin Oven does not, however, engage in the practice of selling Site users identifying information to third parties. Wisconsin Oven may, in its sole discretion, determine that the submission and its contents should be kept confidential. Any or all of these license rights can be assigned and sublicensed by Wisconsin Oven and they apply to all manner of copying, display, distribution, transmission, storage, recording or other media or means of exploitation now known or hereafter invented. If any applicable law, judicial decision or regulatory requirement restricts or limits the provisions of this paragraph, Wisconsin Oven’s liability, if any, will be limited in accordance with THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY terms in Section 6 of these SATS.

Wisconsin Oven may, in its sole discretion without advanced notice, discontinue provision of any Visitor Features to any or all Site visitors and may, in its sole discretion, remove any content provided by a Site visitor.

d) Infringe the copyrights, trademarks, or other personal or proprietary rights of any person or entity.

12. Jurisdiction, Dispute Resolution, Interpretation, Severability, and Merger
These SATS, and all disputes arising from or related to them, their interpretation, or their subject matters (including but not limited to Site Contents) shall be governed by, resolved and remedied in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, USA (without resort to conflict of law principles) as it applies to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such State and to acts or omissions occurring wholly within the State. Any claims arising from or related to the SATS or their subject matters shall be brought and resolved only in the appropriate State or Federal Courts located in Pennsylvania, and you expressly consent to the jurisdiction and exclusive venue of said courts. However, Wisconsin Oven, at its sole discretion, can also institute or convert any action (no matter which party initiates it) to an arbitration under the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association, said arbitration to: (1) apply the choice of law specified above; and (2) take place in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
If otherwise applicable hereto, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (as adopted by any State) and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods are hereby agreed not to be applicable to these SATS and their subject matters. In addition, all disclaimable or waivable local and international provisions related to choice of law or dispute resolution are waived or disclaimed by you in favor of the above choice of Pennsylvania law, jurisdiction and forums for dispute resolution.
You agree and represent that you have carefully considered the SATS and that ambiguities, if any, shall not be enforced against the drafter but shall be fairly read so as not to prejudice the rights of Wisconsin Oven.
If any provision(s) of the SATS are deemed unenforceable in a determination by a body with proper jurisdiction, the Parties agree (without waiving rights of appeal) that the unenforceable provision(s) shall be: (1) reconstituted to approximate as closely as lawfully possible the evident intent of the original provision(s); or (2) if option (1), above, cannot be implemented, the unenforceable provision(s) shall be excised from the SATS and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith with respect to their modification. If the Parties cannot agree to a modification, the SATS shall be enforced, without the unenforceable provision, in a fair manner and without undue prejudice to either Party.
These SATs comprise the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the matters contained herein and shall not be modified except in writing supplied by Wisconsin Oven.
