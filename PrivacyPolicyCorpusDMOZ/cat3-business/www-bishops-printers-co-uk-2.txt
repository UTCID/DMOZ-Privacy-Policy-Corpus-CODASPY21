Flyers and Inserts
What’s the difference between a flyer and a leaflet? Well, unless the leaflet is folded, nothing. The terms are used interchangeably to describe collateral comprising a single sheet, printed on one or both sides. Typically, flyers tend to be A5 size and leaflets A6, but there is no hard and fast rule. What’s more, they don’t have to be rectangular either. Find out more
