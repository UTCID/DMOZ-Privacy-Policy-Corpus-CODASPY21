Cross-Border Data / Data Localization
The rapid and seamless movement of data across borders is essential to the 21st century global economy. Cross-border data transfers allow software companies to provide new and innovative services to every sector of the economy – driving growth, enabling the technologies of the future, improving health and safety, and promoting social good. BSA supports international data transfer agreements such as the EU US Privacy Shield, data transfer frameworks such as the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules, and data transfer provisions in trade agreements.
Data Localization
Some countries are considering, or have implemented, measures that mandate data localization.  Laws that require data to be stored locally, or that restrict the movement of data across borders, not only impede innovation in the development of cutting-edge technology, but also put every local business at a competitive disadvantage by limiting the services available to them. BSA advocates the adoption of trade norms to prevent data localization requirements and opposes new localization proposals and requirements in markets around the world.

The Future of Transatlantic Data Flows
SEP 23, 2020 | US
Companies of all sizes and in all industries need to move data across the Atlantic to reach customers, manage supply chains, collaborate on research, and improve the services they provide to businesses and individuals. And customers—on both sides of the Atlantic—deserve to know that their personal data will be maintained private and secure when their data is transferred. Transatlantic data flows are among the most important for both Europe and the US, accounting for over one-half of Europe’s data transfers and about half of US data transfers. A disruption of transatlantic data flows could have significant adverse effects on consumers, businesses, and economic vitality.
