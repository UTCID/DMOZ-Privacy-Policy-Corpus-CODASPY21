IS A TOOL FOR PRINT COMMUNICATION
Zairmail
provides a service that allows clients to submit documents over the Internet that are automatically printed, addressed, and mailed through United States Postal Service. You are solely responsible for and assume all liability arising from all correspondence that you and any other person using your account submit using the Zairmail
service.
YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS WILL BE ON YOUR CORRESPONDENCE
Zairmail
software will automatically print a return address on every piece of correspondence that you create, print and mail using the Zairmail
service - unless you have included the return address in your mail piece design and you have explicitly asked Zairmail
not to). According to the terms of this agreement, you authorize Zairmail
to print a return address on every piece of correspondence that you create, print and mail when it is not already present. You may not otherwise alter or prevent your name and address from being printed on your correspondence.
NCOA PROCESSING APPROVAL
The Zairmail
service takes advantage of discounts provided by the USPS for pre-sorted First Class mail and pre-sorted Standard A mail.
These discounts require processing lists through the Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) and the National Change of Address database (NCOA) prior to mailing.
The USPS requires a signed NCOALink Processing Acknowledgement Form (PAF) from the owner of each list processed.
When you use the Zairmail
service you give us (or our agents) permission to complete, sign, and retain a copy of this form physically or electronically on your behalf.
You understand and agree that the sole purpose of the NCOALink service is to provide a mailing list correction service that will be used for preparation of mailings. Furthermore, you understand and agree that NCOA Link may not be used to create or maintain new mover lists.

We act merely as a passive conduit for your online composition, creation, printing, and mailing of your Content.
There is NO guarantee that your campaign will be successful or generate new sales for your business even if Zairmail has provided a template, helped design your direct mail piece, supplied your list, or provided consultative or design services.
You are responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of your list, your offer, and your creative, and you bear the full risk and responsibility for the results of your direct mail campaign.
When in doubt we always recommend that you start with a small low-risk test campaign, test thoroughly to come up with a formula that works, and then increase the size/frequency of your campaigns.
We are only responsible for producing and mailing/shipping what you have approved and submitted.
