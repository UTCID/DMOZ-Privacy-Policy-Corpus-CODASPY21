Open Systems International, Inc. Privacy Policy
Open Systems International, Inc., on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries ("OSI"), is committed to protecting
your privacy. We want to assure you that when we ask for information about you, your personal information will be
processed in a lawful and transparent manner and in accordance with the provisions of current legislation on the
protection of personal data, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This policy aims to give you
information about how we collect and process personal data in accordance with our obligations.
Personal Data
Personal data that we may process from you includes data such as first name, surname, email address,
avatar/profile photo, IP address, job role, contact information, or any personally identifiable content.
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to
provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into
with you (for example, to provide you with support for our products). In this case, we may be relieved of that
specific contractual obligation or choose not to proceed with a request but we will notify you if this is the case
at the time.
Collecting and Processing of Personal Data
When you visit our website or use our services, we may process the following personal data about you:
Personal data that you voluntarily provide us via the website or other media (e.g., when accessing OSI Member's
Secure Site, contacting us with your inquiries or for support, registering for events, or participating in surveys,
etc.), including name, e-mail address, telephone number, information submitted as part of a support request, etc.;
and
Information automatically received when visiting our website, such as such as your IP address, the date and time
you visited our website, device type, browser type, referring site, or sites accessed during your visit at our
website.
We process your personal data for the following purposes:
To provide support services and functions and/or to administer your use of our website;
To verify your identity (if you are accessing our Members Secure Site, Hardware Technical Support Site, or our
Customer Support Site);
To answer and fulfill your specific requests; and
As reasonably necessary to enforce the applicable terms of use, to establish or preserve a legal claim or
defense, to prevent fraud or other illegal activities, including attacks on OSI's information technology systems.
Lawful Basis for Use of Your Personal Data
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to, following one of the lawful bases within the
privacy laws. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and, your interests and fundamental rights do not override
those interests. Generally the legitimate interest pursued by OSI in relation to our use of your personal data is
the efficient performance or management of your use of the OSI Member Secure Sites.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Where you have given your consent.
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that
we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an
explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal
basis which allows us to do so.
You have the right to withdraw consent or opt out at any time by contacting us or using the relevant mechanism
provided in the communication at the time, e.g., unsubscribe from a mail marketing campaign, or 'do not contact'
response in a specific email sent by one of our staff. Once opted out, a minimal amount of data will be held in a
suppression / do not contact list so that we avoid any future contact.
For Transfer of Personal Data Outside the European Economic Area
OSI is a global organization and your personal information may be stored and processed outside of your home
country, including in countries that may not offer the same level of protection for your personal information as
your home country. We have measures in place to ensure that when your personal information is transferred
internationally, it is subject to appropriate safeguards in accordance with data protection laws. Often, these
include contractual safeguards. More information about these safeguards can be obtained by contacting us at Privacy_Officer@osii.com.
How long do we keep your data?
Personal data provided will be kept for the period of time necessary to comply with the purpose for which they
were collected, and in any case until the end of the contractual relationship and once the statute of limitations
for any legal actions involved has expired.
Your Legal Rights
Under applicable data protection laws you may have the right to:
Obtain from OSI confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed, and where that is the
case, access to the personal data;
Request correction of your personal data;
Request the erasure of your personal data;
Request the restriction of processing regarding your personal data;
Request transfer of your personal data; and
Object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing of personal data concerning you.
Withdrawal of Consent
You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this
will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
consent, we may not be able to provide certain services or support to you. We will advise you if this is the case at
the time you withdraw your consent.
Email Marketing
We deliver marketing and event communications to you across various platforms such as email, telephone, text
messaging, direct mail and online. If we send you a marketing communication it will include instructions on how to
opt out of receiving these communications in the future. Honoring your marketing preferences is important to us. You
have the right to opt out of receiving direct marketing and targeted online advertising.
When we send marketing emails, we provide unsubscribe options for your use within our emails. In addition, you can
contact us via info@osii.com or contact our privacy team at Privacy_Officer@osii.com.
Even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications by email, we may still send you technical services
bulletins or important transactional information for purposes such as providing customer support.
