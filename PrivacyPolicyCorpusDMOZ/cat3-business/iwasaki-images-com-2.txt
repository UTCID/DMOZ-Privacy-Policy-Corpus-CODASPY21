PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS
IWASAKI IMAGES OF AMERICA and its affiliates attempt to be as accurate as possible.
However, IWASAKI IMAGES OF AMERICA does not warrant that product descriptions or other
content of this site is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If
a product offered by IWASAKI IMAGES OF AMERICA itself is not as described, your sole

PRICING
Except where noted otherwise, the List Price displayed for products on our
website represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested
by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard
industry practice. The List Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may
not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day. For
certain items that are offered as a set, the List Price may represent
"open-stock" prices, which means the aggregate of the manufacturer's estimated
or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set. Where an
item is offered for sale by one of our merchants, the List Price may be provided
by the merchant.
With respect to items sold by IWASAKI IMAGES OF AMERICA, we cannot confirm the price of
an item until you order; however, we do NOT charge your credit card until after
your order has entered the shipping process. Despite our best efforts, a small
number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If we discover a mispricing,
we will do one of the following:
If an item's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge
the lower amount and ship you the item.
If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at
our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel
your order and notify you of such cancellation.
Please note that this policy applies only to products sold and shipped by IWASAKI IMAGES OF AMERICA. Your purchases from third-party sellers using IWASAKI IMAGES OF AMERICA
Payments are charged at the time you place your order, and third-party sellers
may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
