My confidence level has zoomed upIn my work with Deborah, I have been able to release a lot of emotional baggage / blockages that have inhibited me as a speaker. She has the ability to go at a comfortable pace while keying in on what is important to work on in the moment. She provides wonderful positive affirmation. My confidence level has zoomed up and I am much more effective and powerful as a speaker.
