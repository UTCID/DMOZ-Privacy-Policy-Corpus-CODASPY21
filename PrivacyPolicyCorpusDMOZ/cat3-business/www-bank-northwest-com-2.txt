Customer Identification Notice Internet Privacy Policy Kid's Privacy PolicyCustomer Identification NoticeIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: when you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.Internet Privacy PolicyIn continuing our commitment to provide quality service to our customers, Northwest Bank has adopted the following privacy statement for officers, directors and employees. This privacy statement applies to individuals (consumers) and Northwest Bank reserves the right to amend it at any time.Our Internet Web SiteVisitors to the Northwest Bank web site remain anonymous. We do not collect personal identifying information about site users, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Standard software is used to collect and store ONLY the following non-identifying information about our visitors: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or iastate.edu if you are connecting from Iowa State University’s domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site. If you submit an online application, it will be transmitted over a secure connection using encryption and will alert you to this fact.

Visitors may elect to provide us with personal information via e-mail or our feedback form. This information is used internally, as appropriate, to handle the sender’s request and manage the Northwest Bank web site. It is not disseminated or sold to other organizations.
