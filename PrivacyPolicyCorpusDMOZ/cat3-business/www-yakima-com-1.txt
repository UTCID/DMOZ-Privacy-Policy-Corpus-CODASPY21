In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information about your use of Yakima.com through software on your device and other means.

Direct Marketing
We may use information about you to provide you with information about products or services, promotions, special offers and other information which relates to our products or services or which we believe may be of interest to you.
Where your consent is required, we will usually ask for it by asking to you tick an "opt-in" box on the pages of our website where we ask for information about you. The "opt-in" box may or may not be split between different classes of information or different means of marketing.
We may send you such information by:
email
post
smartphone applications
social networking websites
phone
or any other method which becomes relevant from time to time.
You can change your mind about your preferences (as defined above) in respect of direct marketing by contacting our Customer Service Team at 888-925-4621, support@yakima.com, or at 4101 Kruse Way, Lake Oswego, OR 97035. You can do this at any time. In addition, if you receive direct marketing from us by email, you will be reminded in the email that you are free to request a change to your preferences. If you do change your mind about your preferences, we would not remove your Personal Data from our data base(s) but we would note your changed preferences and would cease using your information for the purpose of direct marketing as soon as reasonably possible. If you want your email address deleted permanently, please contact us directly.
