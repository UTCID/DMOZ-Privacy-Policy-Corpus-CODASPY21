required by law. Except for necessary transmission of information to process

shared with anyone outside of CENLYT.

CENLYT processes all credit
cards through third party vendors, specifically PayPal. The use and storage of credit card information
is subject to the terms and conditions of the respective
processors. CENLYT does not process, store or record
credit card information. Payments processed through PayPal are subject to
PayPal's privacy policy .
Information obtained from Server Logs
Our Server Logs automatically collect specific information every time you
visit our site. This includes: Date and Time of visit, IP Address, Browser Type,
Operating Platform, duration of visit and Pages Viewed. The information is
logged both per-session and aggregate total. The per-session log includes all
the aforementioned information. It is kept in a password protected directory and
only accessible by CENLYT. It is not shared or made available to
the public. The aggregate information EXCEPT Date, Time and IP Address is kept indefinitely. The information about your
Browser type and Operating Platform is used so that we may keep the site compatible with
as many formats as possible. The Duration and Pages Viewed information is made
available to our advertisers for the purposes of establishing effectiveness and
costs for ads. NO PERSONAL, IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE FROM
THESE LOGS, INCLUDING YOUR IP ADDRESS.
Information obtained from "Cookies"
Cookies are text files used to obtain various amounts of information
depending on their programming. CENLYT
does not use cookies
to obtain personal, identifiable information. You do not have to have Cookies Enabled on your computer
to use CENLYT Site in itself. However, any services which requires
that you "Log On" and use a "password" do require that you
accept Cookies which provide identity confirmation. We do not have control over
or access to these Cookies or the information they obtain. (Please see the
Privacy Polices of the service providers.) Should you not accept these Cookies,
you may not be able to utilize any of these services. Additionally, sites which
link to or from class="namme Site may utilize Cookies. Again, we do not
have control over or access to these Cookies or the information they obtain.
Web Beacons
a.k.a Web Bugs
Web Beacons, also known as Web Bugs, are invisible images (usually 1 pixel by
1 pixel) placed on a web page to collect information similar to that gathered by banner advertisements, but users
cannot detect the presence of bugs without looking at the source code.
Information you request be posted with
CENLYT
Any information posted with CENLYT becomes public information and access to and use thereof is beyond our
control. This includes, but is not limited to, any Email address posted.
Protecting
Your Email Address
We do not give out Email addresses to anyone without your
consent. However, as there are programs which employ the use of "spiders" to search Web
Sites for Email addresses, for your security, when you post your Email address
to any Web site, we recommend that you use either
use an alternate Email address rather than your personal address, or enter the address in such a manner that it cannot be
automatically used by others, ie. username@yourdomain.REMOVE(net. com, etc.)
with a note telling users to delete the "REMOVE" from the
address. While this disables the option to Click On the address to send an
Email, it also drastically reduces your chances of having your Email address
added to a mailing list via the use of spiders. And since the majority of these
spiders are building mailing lists for Spamming purposes, losing the ability to
"click on" your Email address is a small price to pay to avoid Spam.
Links to Other Sites
Users should be aware that when you are visiting CENLYT, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There
are links to other sites from CENLYT that take you outside our
service. This
includes links from listings, advertisers, sponsors, partners and affiliates that may use
CENLYT logo or name as part of a co-branding agreement. While we
attempt to
inspect sites that are directly linked to CENLYT, CENLYT
cannot and will not be liable for the content of any site not
directly under the control of CENLYT nor will CENLYT
be
liable for for the use of any information obtained by these sites whether
through the use of Cookies or information which you voluntarily submit.
Emails - Solicited and Unsolicited
Due to the increase in Email related viruses and worms, CENLYT does not accept any unsolicited Emails with attachments nor Emails with
attachments with file extensions including, but not limited to: ".exe",  ".vbs",
".vbe", "js", "doc", "cfm", "htm or
html" or any other extension which can automatically engage or run a
plug-in, program or script or which is unfamiliar or known to contain or
potentially contain a virus or worm - They will automatically be returned. If
you would like to post information, the information must be contained in the
body of the Email. Thank
You.
Information from Social Networking (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.)
With the increase in social network plug-ins, there is an increase in privacy concerns.
CENLYT does not utilize social network plug-ins and therefore does not gather any information about you through social network plug-ins
(These plug-ins provide you the opportunity to log on to a website via your
social network log on information). The "share" buttons on our site do not track
your web activities, but merely shares information about CENLYT on the
respective social network.

that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website
from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is

WHAT CENLYT WILL PROVIDE - IN
GENERAL -
Except for plain, straight text only pages using a visitor's default browser
setting, no web page can be compatible with every browser version or operating
system without extensive, and expensive, scripting. At CENLYT, we strive to be
compatible with as many browsers and platforms as possible. As such, each page
is formatted using HTML 5, English, and Cascading Style Sheet
format Version CSS3, the standards of which being set by the World Wide Web Consortium
(www.w3c.org
). Each page will
be tested in Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Chrome and Safri, versions 8.X and above using
screen resolutions up to 1,280 pixels wide. Each page shall
dynamically adjust to these various screen resolutions except for browser
specific coding which is necessary for cross-compatibility. Customers are
reminded that, while every effort is made to provide uniform look and function,
not every design/page will display or operate the same in every browser and are
ultimately subject to the default browser settings of the visitor.
AND A FEW OTHERS THINGS WE PROVIDE - IN
GENERAL -
Each design includes on the standard META tags in the HEAD element including
Character Coding, Language, and Title. We also include those tags which help
facilitate your placement in search engines: Description, Robots and Revisit. We also include
Keywords tag, but this
currently is not recognized by most search engines.
When applicable, Content Rating tags, Web Accessibility Initiative and
Platform for Privacy Project (P3P) will also be included.
With each design, we include a break-out-of-frames script. This script
prevents your pages from being "trapped" inside a frames page. On
smaller designs, it is embedded: larger designs it's externally fed. Of course,
the script is not applied to pages that are to appear within a frame-set.
Upon completion of the design/web, we will do a one-time submission of your
site to major search engines. (This is only included with full designs, however,
submissions to search engines is available for an additional fee.)
For thirty calendar days after a design is completed, we will correct any
errors that are our fault at no charge. For seven calendar days after
maintenance is performed by us, we will correct any errors which are our fault
and which are directed related to the maintenance performed.
