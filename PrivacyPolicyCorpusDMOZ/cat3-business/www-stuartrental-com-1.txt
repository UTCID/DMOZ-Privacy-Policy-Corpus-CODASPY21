IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING COVID-19
The Stuart Rental Company’s highest priority is the health and safety of our team members, clients, and their families. Therefore, we are taking this opportunity to set forth how we are managing our business operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We will continue to update our policies as we learn more from the medical and scientific community, including new information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We encourage everyone to frequently refer to the CDC website for the latest on how best to contain and mitigate the impact of the virus.
OUR SHOWROOM IS OPEN
LIMITED HOURS: 10:00AM to 2:00PM, MON-FRI
CLEANING AND SANITATION
We have enhanced the process and increased the frequency of our equipment cleaning, spending extra attention to regularly contacted surfaces.
– We are using the same chemicals on our equipment as hospitals use to disinfect their surfaces.
– In addition, we continue to launder all linens and disinfect dishware, silverware, and glassware with high-temp commercial dishwashers, industrial sanitizers and chemicals.
– These processes are done in compliance with the latest California state and federal CDC guidance to ensure our products are COVID-19-free following their cleaning.
– We are cleaning our showroom, offices, warehouse and common areas with greater frequency using hospital-grade disinfectants, paying special attention to frequently touched surfaces.
– We have curtailed all non-essential employee travel to minimize the risk of spreading the virus to our staff and among the general population and we have instructed employees who feel ill to stay home and consult their healthcare provider.
DELIVERY AND PICKUP PROTOCOL: 10:00AM to 2:00PM, MON-FRI
We are keeping our teams current on all recommendations and updates from the CDC as well as instituting new safety precautions for the pickup and delivery of any product.
– We have equipped our delivery and pickup teams with masks, nitrile gloves, hand sanitizer, and EPA-approved cleaners/disinfectants specifically recommended by the CDC in its Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection Recommendations.
– During pickups and deliveries, we wipe all products with all-purpose cleaning solution and a disinfecting cleanser.
– Nitrile gloves are carefully disposed of after every pickup.
– We have instructed our staff to follow CDC-recommended social distancing guidelines, including avoiding shaking hands and using proper hygiene etiquette including hand washing.
We are committed to doing what is necessary to curtail the impact of COVID 19 and will therefore update these policies as the CDC and local and state health officials issue more guidance.
