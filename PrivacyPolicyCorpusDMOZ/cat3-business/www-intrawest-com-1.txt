Intrawest Privacy Policy
Intrawest is committed to the privacy of our customers and guests (“you” and “your”). The Intrawest Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to Personal Information that Intrawest collects, whether online, in person, through our call centers or otherwise.
“Personal Information” is information about an identifiable individual. Personal Information does not include information about a business or aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific individual.
“Intrawest”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates. Intrawest has an international presence and maintains offices and facilities in multiple jurisdictions throughout the United States and Canada. Except in circumstances where the privacy policy of an affiliate or partner applies, all of Intrawest’s business operations are subject to this policy.
This Policy does not apply to information about Intrawest’s employees or to information that is not Personal Information.

Several of our resorts use GPS tracking technology in connection with their ski and ride school programs in order to track and locate students on the mountain.  The GPS tracking technology is owned and operated by a third party service provider which may be provided certain information to operate websites on which you and/or your family members can track your day on the mountain.
At certain of our resort locations we may use video surveillance for the safety and security of our guests, employees and property. We will retain video recordings for as long as reasonably necessary for these purposes.
