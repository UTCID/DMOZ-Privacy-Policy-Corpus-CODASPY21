Making A Purchase
Making a purchase could not be easier. Just browse our store and add any items that you wish to buy into the shopping cart. After you have finished your selection, click on 'Checkout' and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to complete the order.
We accept most credit and debit cards. Visa, Visa Debit, Mastercard and MaestroWhen confirmation of order is received, this is to indicate that we have received your order. It does not indicate that a contract exists between us. We will indicate acceptance of your order, and hence a contract between us, when we send you an invoice. We have included this term in the case that a mistake has been made in pricing, we have inadvertently under-priced goods, or we are no longer able to supply a particular product for some reason. In the case of a change of price, we will always contact you first to ensure that the price is acceptable.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping is by next day courier. This does not mean that the product is shipped same day. Certain items that require customisation may take 3 - 5 days to complete. Please Note: Shipping price is for England, Wales and lower parts of Scotland only. Scottish Highlands, Ireland, Channel Isles, Scilly Isles, Isle of Man and international deliveries will require additional charges. Please contact us for advice & prices.
Damaged Items
If you are unfortunate enough to receive a damaged item, make sure it's noted on the courier's paperwork. If you notice after the courier has left, you must inform us within a 24 hour period. No claims for damaged or missing items can be made after this time, unless signed for as damaged or missing. We cannot be held responsible for any delivery signed for as undamaged which is subsequently reported to have been damaged in transit.
Back Orders
If your item is not in stock, we will back order for you. You will always be emailed with the option to cancel your order if you would rather not wait.
Tax Charges
All prices are exclusive of 20% VAT. The total at checkout includes VAT
Credit Card Security
When the order is placed at our website, credit card numbers are encrypted using 128 bit encryption and are passed directly to our payment processor; Sage Pay Europe Limited. At no point are the details exposed in an unencrypted form to us.
Privacy Policy
MAJIsign Limited do not disclose buyers' information to third parties other than when order details are processed as part of the order fulfillment. In this case, the third party will not disclose any of the details to any other third party.  MAJIsign Limited will retain your infomarion as described in our Data Privacy statement.
Returns and Cancellations
Your right to cancel your order: cancellation notice and returns as a business customer
You (the business) have the right to cancel your order for un-personalised goods within a 7 working day period. The cancellation period starts from the day the order is received.
For personalised goods you can cancel your order at any time prior to the goods being made though there may be a cancellation charge equivalent to any artwork or plate charges already incurred by MAJIsign Ltd.
We require you to send a notice of cancellation in writing (or by email). A telephone call is sufficient but must be followed by an email. In the event of cancellation, any received goods must be returned (as new) at the consumer's own expense. If required MAJIsign Ltd can arrange for the goods to be collected and the cost will be returned from the refund total.
We will only accept return of personalised goods if they are damaged or faulty. If the product arrives to you damaged or faulty in any way, this must be notified within 3 days of receipt. To avoid uncertainty we request that notification be made in writing (email, letter or fax).
For un-personalised goods we have a 7-day returns policy, so if for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase you can return it to us within 7 days of receipt. To qualify for credit, goods must be returned in original packaging and in re-saleable condition. We reserve the right to charge a 20% restocking fee where we deem applicable and will not credit original carriage charge. If the product arrives to you damaged or faulty in any way, this must be notified within 24 hours of receipt. The sales staff will then arrange to uplift and replace. Thereafter we accept no responsibility as goods may have been damaged after arrival. This does not affect your statutory rights.

Terms and Conditions for Business Customers

General

You are registered with us as a business customer and these are the terms and conditions of sale (the Terms) that apply to transactions between you and us.
The Contract is the contract between us and you for the sale by us and purchase by you of the Product in accordance with these Terms. By purchasing any products from us (the Products) and by using the Site or submitting orders, you acknowledge that you have read and you agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms and that they supersede any alternative or previously used terms of supply.
A working day is any day other than weekends and bank or other UK public holidays.
In these Terms, the following rules apply:
A person includes a natural person, corporate or unincorporated body (whether or not having separate legal personality).
A reference to a party includes its personal representatives, successors or permitted assigns.
A reference to writing or written includes faxes and emails.
You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by us or on our behalf which is not set out in the Contract. Any representations about the Products shall have no effect unless expressly agreed in writing and signed by one of our authorised representatives.
Any samples, drawings, images, descriptive matter, or advertising issued by us and any descriptions or illustrations contained in our catalogues or brochures or on the Site are issued or published for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Products described in them. They shall not form part of the Contract or any other contract between you and us for the sale of the Products.
Purchase of Products
The placing of a Product on our Site is an invitation to accept offers for such Product and is not an offer to sell at the listed price nor is it binding on us. We are under no obligation to accept your order (whether or not the order has been acknowledged and payment made).
If we agree to allow you to open a managed trade account (a Trade Account) with us you may email, or telephone us with your Order. Orders can also be input using the separate log-in details for your account, if these have been supplied to you. You shall ensure that the terms of your Order are complete and accurate. We will manually input your Order into our online Site system to process the Order. You will be sent an order acknowledgement containing details of your order which you must check for any errors, this is your responsibility. If you discover any errors you must notify us in a timely fashion and prior to the order being sent, otherwise we will not be able to make changes to the Order details and we are not responsible or liable to you for such errors unless we have failed to correct them following notification from you received prior to dispatch.
After placing an Order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your Order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted.
All orders are subject to acceptance by us; we will notify you by email confirming whether we have processed your payment (the Payment Confirmation). At the same time, if we have accepted your Order, we will notify you of delivery dates. The contract between us (Contract) will only be formed when we send you the Payment Confirmation for your Order.
The Contract will relate only to those Products which we have expressly confirmed in the Payment Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your Order until the acceptance of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Payment Confirmation.
Any Order is subject to availability of the Product. If the Product becomes unavailable prior to delivery we will notify you as soon as possible following the Payment Confirmation. Either us or you may then cancel the part(s) of the Order relating to the unavailable Product (including those Products which can be reasonably linked to the unavailable Product) or we will, where possible, give you the choice of purchasing an alternative from us. A full refund will be issued to you for all cancelled parts of your Order after we have received from you or sent notification of cancellation of the Order. If you choose to purchase an alternative product these Terms will apply. If an alternative is chosen and payment has already been taken for the Order we will refund to you any overpayment or, in the case of an underpayment, you will pay us any additional sums due in relation to the Alternative.
In the event that a Product is listed or quoted at an incorrect price due to an error, we will notify you within 14 days of the Payment Confirmation of the correct price by email or telephone. Either us or you may then cancel the part(s) of the Order relating to the incorrectly priced Product (including those Products which can be reasonably linked to the incorrectly priced Product) or you may purchase the incorrectly priced Product(s) at the correct price. If you confirm you want to purchase the Product at the corrected price we will then arrange delivery of the Product to you. If payment has been taken for the Product and you cancel your Order we will, on return of the Product (if the Product has been sent out) issue a refund. If only some of the Products you ordered are mispriced it will not affect the Order in relation to any Products which were priced correctly.
Delivery
The Products will be delivered to the address you give when you place your Order (Delivery Location) however we reserve the right not to make deliveries outside the United Kingdom.
Any dates quoted for delivery are approximate only, and the time of delivery is not of the essence. We will not be liable for any delay in delivery of Products if you fail to provide us with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Products or make the Delivery Location available to us. We will also not be liable for any delay in the delivery of Products when certain circumstances beyond our control arise, making performance inadvisable, commercially impracticable, illegal, or impossible.
Risk in the Products passes to you when the Products are signed for at the Delivery Location. We accept no responsibility for any damage to or loss of the Products after the risk passes.
It is your responsibility to check the Products upon delivery. Upon receipt of your Order you will be asked to sign for the Products confirming receipt in good condition. If the Products do not appear to be in good condition then please refuse the delivery. If you are unable to check the contents of your delivery at the point of delivery then please sign for the parcel as “unchecked”. Failure to do so may affect claims you make thereafter.
We will inform you as soon as possible after Payment Confirmation if we are unable to deliver the Products to you on the date requested by you and we will, in consultation with you, set an alternative delivery date or period. We shall not be liable to you for any damage or loss you incur as a result of delay in delivery.
If you fail to accept delivery of the Products and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to us, we may store the Products until delivery takes place, and charge you for all related costs and expenses (including insurance) and after a period of 21 working days resell or otherwise dispose of part or all of the Products and, after deducting reasonable storage and selling costs (including, without limitation, insurance), account to you for any excess over the price of the Products or charge you for any shortfall below the price of the Products.
The quantity of any consignment of Products as recorded by us upon despatch shall be conclusive evidence of the quantity received by you on delivery unless you can provide conclusive evidence proving the contrary.
We shall not be liable for any non-delivery of Products (even if caused by our negligence) unless you give written notice to us of the non-delivery within 2 working days of the date when the Products would in the ordinary course of events have been received.
Our liability for non-delivery of the Products shall be limited to replacing the Products within a reasonable time or issuing a credit note against any invoice raised for such Products. Please note that we ask that you use any credit note within 2 years of the date of issue.

Title to the Products shall not pass to you until the later of the following:

completion of delivery by our carrier.
You agree to give us such information relating to the Products as we may require from time to time, but you may resell or use the Products in the ordinary course of your business.
