Your personal information can be used to provide you with the needed information, products or services, as well as helping to enhance your experience with the university’s resources and technology services.

UC will comply with its published data protection policies in the processing of your personal data, except for legally permitted exceptions.  Please see UC’s Office of Information Security website for related policies and further detail.
If you have specific questions regarding the collection and use of your personal data, please contact the Director of Privacy within the Office of General Counsel.
Data Retention
Generally, UC retains data it collects as specified in its General Records Retention Schedule.

GDPR Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data

Processing for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by UC or by a third party;
Processing for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
Processing for compliance with a legal obligation to which UC is subject; and
Processing pursuant to the consent of a data subject for one or more specific purposes.
GDPR Individual Rights of the Data Subject

To request your personal data to be transferred to a third party; and
To file a complaint.
Please be aware that under certain circumstances, the GDPR or other applicable laws may limit a data subject's exercise of the above rights.
