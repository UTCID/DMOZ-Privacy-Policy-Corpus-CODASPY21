Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
Hatch & Muir LLP must collect, use and disclose your personal information in order to provide you with our services. We cannot provide you with those services if you object to our collecting, using and disclosing your information. Hatch & Muir LLP will therefore consider that your continuing to maintain your investment account(s) and/or insurance contract(s) with us constitutes your consent to our continuing to collect, use and disclose your personal information. In future, if Hatch & Muir LLP identifies a new purpose for collecting, using or disclosing your information, we will seek your consent before doing so.
The Necessity for Personal Information
Throughout the course of our relationship with you, Hatch & Muir LLP collects personal information from you. This information typically includes “know your client” information about your personal circumstances, including your financial situation and your investment objectives, as well as information about your investments, banking information, insurance contracts, estate planning documents and social insurance number.
Hatch & Muir LLP uses such personal information only for the purpose of administering your account with us (including but not limited to buying and selling mutual funds on your behalf, and reporting to you), and complying with legal and regulatory requirements, through our sponsoring mutual fund dealer, Worlrdsource Financial Management (“Worldsource”).
In addition, your information could also be used for, but is not limited to, the following purposes:
Engage in the preparation of financial plans, both comprehensive and single needs,
Prepare and assess your applications for investments, insurance or other financial services, and service these products over time,
Evaluate claims and underwriting risks when required,
Communicate with you in a timely and efficient manner,
Analyze business results,
Detect and prevent fraud, and
Act as required or authorized by insurance and securities laws.
Disclosing Personal Information
We may provide information to companies that perform services on our behalf (such as preparing and mailing statements or processing trades and payments). We may also provide personal information to mutual fund issuers in which you invest, and receive information from them about your investments.
Several self-regulatory organizations, such as the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada, may at times require access to personal information for regulatory purposes (such as trading surveillance, regulatory audits, investigation of potential violations, enforcement or disciplinary proceedings and regulatory reporting). Such organizations may in turn share such information with other self-regulatory organizations (such as the BC Securities Commission and other provincial regulatory bodies), stock exchanges and law enforcement agencies.
Hatch & Muir LLP will not disclose your information to any other organizations to use for their own purposes, and in particular never sells or trades your personal information.
If you have any comments, inquiries or complaints about our handling of your personal information, we encourage you to contact our office at:
