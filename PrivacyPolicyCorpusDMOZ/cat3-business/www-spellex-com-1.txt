Spellex Write-Assist helps learners of all ages independently access
complex text which increases the inclusive learning environment for collaborative
tasks.
- Rebecca Carlson, LTD-C (Consultant)
Congratulations on an excellent program... the most thorough medical speller we have tried. - Maureen Kiplinger, Women's Hospital
One of the best benefits of this [Spellex] program is the spelling report feature which allows dyslexics to learn which words they are frequently misspelling. - Shannon Ramos, Disability Case Manager
As a sole practitioner, I rely heavily on technology... Spellex Legal is a superb enhancement to WordPerfect's more general spelling checker. The program provides an excellent alternative for looking up words in Black's Law Dictionary.
- Jeffrey Shibley, Attorney
My students use the Spellex dyslexic font... and appear to have a greater understanding of the material.   Comprehension and participation in the classroom has improved.
- Jennifer Trout, PhD, Professor, Rasmussen University
I was amazed at the number of new drug names [Spellex software] recognized.
- Linda Combee, Start Typing
Spellex Write-Assist helps learners of all ages independently access complex text which increases the inclusive learning environment for collaborative tasks.
- Rebecca Carlson, LTD-C (Consultant)
This program has been a lifesaver for me. I type from home and it makes a big difference in the way I type. - Lanette Thompson, Medical Transcriptionist
