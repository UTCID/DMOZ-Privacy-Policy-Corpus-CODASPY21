Hijackal behavior is chronically difficult behavior. When I wrote this book, I coined the term, "Hijackals," and I define them as "people who hijack a relationship for their own purposes while scavenging for power, status, and control."
Does that sound like someone you know? Someone you love? Someone you live with? Someone you work with?
If so, you need insights that will lead to understanding, skills that will help you be confident, and strategies that will lead you to decide the next best steps for your relationship...and for yourself.
The Hijackal Trap: The Hidden Anger of Passive-Aggression in the full edition covers recognizing, responding to, and recovering from living with, loving or leaving a chronically difficult person.  The Passive-Aggressive Edition offers the overview of Hijackals and speaks mainly about recognizing and managing passive-aggressive behaviors effectively.
BUY THE BOOK ON AMAZON IN KINDLE FORMAT HERE.
