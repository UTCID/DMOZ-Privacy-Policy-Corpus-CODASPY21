What is online behavioural advertising/ interest based advertising?
Online behavioural advertising (also known as interest-based advertising) is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests.
Shared interests are grouped together based upon previous web browsing activity and web users are then served advertising which matches their shared interests. In this way, advertising can be made as relevant and useful as possible. Relevant ads can also be delivered based upon the website content you have just been viewing. This is known as ‘retargeting’.
There are a number of sites which can help you opt out of online behavioural advertising from the third party advertising agencies that operate online behavioural advertising for website publishers.
These include http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

Disabling other companies interest based ads
Opting out doesn’t stop interest-based ads that aren’t served by Google. So, when you browse the Internet and see a website, video, or app that’s outside of Google’s Display Network, you may still see interest-based ads from other companies.
What to do: Find a cross-industry opt out tool or control that works for your browser or device, like Aboutads.info or Online Choices (for European users).
The links above could became obsolete (not dependent on us).
The same information is, however, easily found using a search engine.
