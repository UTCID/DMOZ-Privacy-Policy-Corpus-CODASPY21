IP addresses are numbers that are automatically assigned to your computer, and, if associated with other individually identifiable information, could be considered personal information. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer and improve StreetSmart Solutions' websites. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information, some of which we aggregate and then share with our strategic alliances or potential strategic alliances companies. We also use your IP address to keep track of the information you have seen on our sites.
Use of Cookies.
Cookies are a standard technology used by commercial web services to store small pieces of information on your hard drive by sending a small string of text to your browser. They make your use of StreetSmart Solutions' websites more pleasing and efficient by “personalizing” your user interface, for example, or identifying which parts of a site you have previously visited. They also enable us to pre-populate, or automatically fill out, forms and schedules. They enable us to tailor the information you receive and to assist third party organizations with whom we have strategic alliances by identifying you as an StreetSmart Solutions client, employee or StreetSmart Solutions website user. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, unless you have configured yours not to accept them. In order for us to provide you with services on our website, your browser must accept cookies, as they are essential for site administration and security. StreetSmart Solutions does not use cookies either to collect individually identifiable information or to collect non-individually identifiable information using a cookie that is combined with a personal identifier.

A user’s log file tells StreetSmart Solutions where a user comes from when entering an StreetSmart Solutions website; which part of the StreetSmart Solutions website the user visits as well as where the user goes when leaving the StreetSmart Solutions website; and how much time the user spends in the StreetSmart Solutions websites.
