If a package is damaged in shipment, you should not accept the package without appropriate documentation of damage.

Printing of SafetySign.com Logo and Part Number on Signs
All SafetySign.com products have the SafetySign.com logo and part number printed in small print on the front of the product. This is for both reordering purposes for the end user and as a recall mechanism to manage the return of product if necessary.
Custom products can be printed without the SafetySign.com logo and part number if requested at the time of ordering. Stock products can be printed without the SafetySign.com logo at the time of ordering for an additional charge. If an order for stock product is placed on our website with the request for no logo/part number, the customer will be contacted by our sales team to discuss these extra charges. Additionally, any stock product ordered without a SafetySign.com logo/part number will be considered custom products and are NOT RETURNABLE.

SafetySign.com collects sales tax where required by law. Sales tax is automatically calculated for orders shipping within the United States during checkout. Learn more by reading our Sales Tax help page.
Sales Tax Exemption
During checkout, you will be given the opportunity to indicate that your order is tax-exempt. If you tell us your order is tax-exempt, you will be responsible for sending us your tax exemption certificate via email (salestax@safetysign.com) or fax (800-279-6897) after you place your order. We’ll deduct sales tax from your order after verifying your tax exemption certificate.
You must provide your certificate within two business days; failing to do so will cause sales tax to be charged to your payment method.
We are unable to remove sales tax from invoices after your order has shipped.
