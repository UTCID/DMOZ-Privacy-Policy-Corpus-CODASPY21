The collection of your personal public and non-public information enables HFG to conduct our everyday business and perform an evaluation of your loan application.
What does HFG do with your personal information?
Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:
