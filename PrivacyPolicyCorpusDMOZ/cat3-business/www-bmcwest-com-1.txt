You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing any Content without the express written consent of BMC. Any unauthorized use (including, without limitation, the foregoing) of the Site, or any Content terminates the permission or license granted by BMC.

9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability
THE SITE AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. BMC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OF THE SITE IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, OR ERROR-FREE. NEITHER BMC NOR ITS THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SITE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, OR FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE.
YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SITE, INCLUDING YOUR SUBMISSION OF ANY PAYMENT OR OTHER INFORMATION, IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, BMC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. BMC DOES NOT REPRESENT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SITE WILL BE FREE FROM LOSS, CORRUPTION, ATTACK, VIRUSES, INTERFERENCE, HACKING, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSION, AND BMC DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY RELATING THERETO. IN NO EVENT WILL THE BMC INDEMNITEES (AS DEFINED BELOW) BE LIABLE, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE BMC INDEMNITEES AND RELEASE THE BMC INDEMNITEES FROM ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM (A) THE USE OF THE SITE, (B) ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS OR FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE, (C) ANY ACTIONS BMC TAKES OR FAILS TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF COMMUNICATIONS YOU SEND TO BMC, OR (D) THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE; INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER CONTRACT, LAW, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF BMC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.

YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE CLAIMS OR ANY DISPUTE WITH BMC RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE USE OF THE SITE IS TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SITE.
YOU AND BMC AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES OR THE CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
10. Indemnification
You will indemnify and hold harmless BMC and its affiliates, and our or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and third party providers (collectively, the “BMC Indemnitees”), on demand, from and against any and all fines, penalties, liabilities, losses and other damages of any kind whatsoever (including attorneys’ and experts’ fees), incurred by any of the BMC Indemnitees, and shall defend the BMC Indemnitees against (1) all claims relating to Your use of the Site, including that any information, data or other materials (whether tangible or intangible) provided by You in connection with Your use of the Site or these Terms of Use, or use thereof by any BMC Indemnitee, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any trademark, trade secret, patent, copyright or other intellectual property right or proprietary right of a third party; (2) all claims arising from fraud committed by, or the intentional misconduct or gross negligence of, You; and (3) all claims otherwise arising due to a failure to comply with, or breach by You of, any provision of these Terms of Use.
We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You and, in such case, You agree to cooperate with us in the defense of such matter, at Your sole cost and expense.
11. Termination
We reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion and without notice to You, to terminate, modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Site or Your Account or access to the Site (including Your ability to conduct transactions on the Site), and we will not be liable to You or to any third party should we exercise such rights. In the event these Terms of Use are terminated as between You and BMC, all provisions which, expressly or by their nature, survive the termination of these Terms of Use, including the restrictions regarding Content, and the representations and warranties, indemnities, and limitations of liabilities set forth in these Terms of Use, will survive termination.
12. Jurisdiction and Governing Law
All rights and obligations of BMC, the BMC Indemnitees or You relating to these Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations of the State of North Carolina without giving effect to any choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of North Carolina or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
You hereby irrevocably consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the State of North Carolina for the adjudication of any matter arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use and waive any objection based on improper venue or inconvenient forum. No course of dealing or usage of trade will apply to these Terms of Use.
We recognize that it is possible for You to obtain access to the Site from any jurisdiction in the world, but we have no practical ability to prevent such access. The Site has been designed to comply with the laws of the State of North Carolina and of the United States. If any Content, or Your use of the Site, is contrary to the laws of the place where You are when You access it, the site is not intended for You, and we ask You not to use the Site. You are responsible for informing Yourself of the laws of Your jurisdiction and complying with them.
13. Changes
You acknowledge that BMC, in its sole discretion may change, modify, add to or remove any portion of the Site, our policies, or these Terms of Use (including any instructions, policies or guidelines referred to in these Terms of Use) at any time, without notice to You by posting amended Terms of Use with a revised effective date.
All such modifications will be binding upon You as of the revised effective date. You may not amend or modify these Terms of Use under any circumstances.
Your continued use of the Site after any such change is posted to the Site will be considered Your acceptance of those changes.
14. Entire Agreement
These Terms of Use govern Your use of the Site, including the submission of all data, information and other materials (whether tangible or intangible and including order, payment and personal information) through the Site. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between You and BMC with regard to your use of the Site and all matters addressed herein, to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions (including any terms or conditions that you purport to apply under any work order, purchase order, order confirmation, specification, email, telephone call or other document or communication).
No terms or conditions endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in or communicated by any of the foregoing will form part of these Terms of Use.
For the avoidance of doubt, any sale of goods or services through the Site is subject to the terms and conditions posted at www.buildwithbmc.com/bmc/s/termsOfSale (“Terms of Sale”).
In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Terms of Sale, the Terms of Sale shall prevail.
15. General
You will not assign or otherwise transfer Your rights and obligations under these Terms of Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of BMC. Any actual or attempted assignment without such consent will be void.
Failure by BMC to enforce any provision in these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of such or any other provision.
No waiver will be binding upon BMC unless in writing and signed by BMC, and any such waiver will be limited to the particular instance referred to.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect and such invalid provision, to the maximum extent permitted by law and to the extent possible, will be construed in accordance with the original intent of the parties, and to the extent not possible, will be deemed severable from these Terms.
As used in these Terms of Use, the word “including” and words of similar import means “including, without limitation.”
16. Comments, Complaints and Questions
We welcome Your feedback about the Site. However, any comments, ideas, notes, messages, suggestions or other communications sent to the Site shall be and remain the exclusive property of BMC, and we may use all such communications in any manner without compensation to You.
