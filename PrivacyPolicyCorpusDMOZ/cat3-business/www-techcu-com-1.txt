NOTICE:
As we continue to balance our role as an essential service provider with the health of our employees and members, the ability to staff all of our branches is sometimes impacted. Our Milpitas, Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Sunnyvale branches will be temporarily closed effective December 2nd. As more members opt for non-face-to-face interactions, you may experience longer hold times when calling our Member Contact Center. We apologize for this inconvenience.

Join Us in Helping Victims of the California Wildfires
The fires raging in Northern and Southern California have been a strain on our members, communities and the state—compounding the stress we were already feeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. We have read and seen the heartbreaking reports of devastation, and we understand the importance of a community united in assisting however we can.
Now and always, Tech CU has made supporting both our local and surrounding communities a priority. And, with fires causing devastation in our backyards and ravaging our southern neighbors, this disaster feels truly personal.
Tech CU has made a donation to our partner, Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, to support their efforts in assisting the victims and volunteers of these fires. Second Harvest supplies both KN95 and N95 masks to those working and volunteering outdoors and works with partners to provide meal programs that meet the needs of people who have been impacted—ensuring that food and water gets to those who need it most.
We also support the extraordinary work done by The American Red Cross, providing invaluable relief to those affected by wildfires and other disasters.
Please consider joining us in supporting our communities:
