Disputes
Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to Detail King Text Messages will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you my assert claims in a Pennsylvania magisterial district court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Conditions of Use.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIMS. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY. ALTHOUGH REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT, AND MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a demand to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) describing your claim and serve a copy of the demand on Detail King, LP, 947A Old Frankstown Road, Pittsburgh PA 15239. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules and the form for filing an arbitration claim are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees (but not any attorney’s fees) for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous. Likewise, Detail King, LP will not seek attorney’s fees and costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submission, or in person in the county where you live or at another agreed upon location.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceeding of any nature or in any forum will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. This means that you may not purport to act on behalf of a class or any other person. Likewise, an arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable. This means that any claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury.
Applicable Law
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW (OR IN THE ABSENCE OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THEN THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA), WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, WILL GOVERN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AGAINST DETAIL KING, LP ARISING OUR OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY DETAIL KING TEXT MESSAGES.
