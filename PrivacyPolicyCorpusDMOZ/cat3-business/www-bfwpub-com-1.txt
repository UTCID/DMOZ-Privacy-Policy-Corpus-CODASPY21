Achieve Read & Practice
71%

The average rate of engagement with assigned activities was 71%.
The average rate of meeting the target with assigned activities was 71%.
+4
Retaking quizzes for practice supports student academic performance, regardless of their level of academic preparedness and baseline level of motivation: If a student retakes at least one quiz for practice, they can expect that, on average, their final course grade will increase by 4 points, regardless of their academic preparation, level of motivation, or the instructor teaching the course.
+13
The more engagement a student had with Read & Practice, the higher they could expect their average exam score over the course of the semester to be and the higher they could expect their final course grade to be. Students less academically prepared realize a boost of about 4 percentage points on their final course grade when they crossed the 80% engagement threshold and students more academically prepared realize a 13 point boost

Easy to Use
As the instructor, you select the book you want to use. Then you decide which chapters and sections you want students to work with first, and when. Assign those sections.
Students Come to Class Prepared
Students will then read the e-book and answer some adaptive quiz questions. If they do well on a topic, then they are all set. If there are topics where they struggle, they are encouraged to re-read the material and answer a few short quiz questions
Students Have Better Performance and Instructors Can See Key Analytics
Instructors can see all this work in the gradebook, noting which students are struggling or which topics are confusing. This information can then be used to change class discussion or to reach out to particular students.
