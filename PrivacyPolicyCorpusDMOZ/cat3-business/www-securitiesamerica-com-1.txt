FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA ONLY
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
Rights Under State Law (California)
Residents of California have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) regarding their personal information.
Most of the data that Securities America collects is exempt from the provisions of the CCPA, which do not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations including SEC Regulation S-P or the California Financial Information Privacy Act.  This section therefore does not apply to such information.  This section also does not apply to other categories of information that are exempted from the privacy policy notification requirements of the CCPA, including certain information processed exclusively in the business-to-business context (e.g., information about an individual acting in his or her capacity as a representative of a company) and information collected about employees, job applicants, and contractors.
Rights Under the CCPA and other California Laws
If your information is covered by the CCPA, you have the rights described below.
Right To Request Disclosure of Information We Collect and Share
If your personal information is covered by the CCPA you have a right to request that we provide the following information:
The categories of personal information that we have collected.
The categories of sources from which we collected the personal information.
The business or commercial purposes for which we collected and/or sold the personal information.
The categories of any third parties with which we shared the personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected over the past year.
You may also submit a request for the following additional information:
The categories of personal information, if any, we have sold, categories of third parties to which we sold that personal information, and the categories of personal information sold to each type of third party.
The categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose.
Our responses to any of these requests will cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the request.
PLEASE NOTE:  Securities America does not sell personal information.
Right To Request the Deletion of Personal Information We Have Collected
If your personal information is covered by the CCPA you may also request deletion of information covered by the CCPA that we maintain.  Upon receiving and verifying such a request, we will delete the personal information, unless that information is necessary for us to:
complete the transaction for which the firm collected the information;
provide you with a good or service requested;
perform a contract we entered into with you;
detect security incidents;
maintain the functionality or security of our systems;
comply with or exercise rights provided by the law; or
use the information internally in ways that are comparable with the context in which information was provided by you to us, or that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us, among other things.
Please note that if we receive a request that personal information be deleted, you may no longer be able to access or use certain parts of our websites.
How To Exercise These Rights
To exercise these CCPA rights, you should email CCPA@saionline.com or contact us at 833-204-5527.  You may also submit a request in person through your registered representative.
Our Processes for Responding to CCPA Requests
Timeline for responding: We will respond to requests for access or deletion as soon as practicable and in any event generally not more than within 45 days after receipt of your request.  We may extend this period to 90 days in some cases.
Verifying requests: Depending on the nature of your request, we may ask for information to verify the request and your identity.
Designating an agent: You may designate an agent to submit a request on your behalf.  The agent can be a natural person or a business entity that is registered with the California Secretary of State.  If you would like to designate an agent to act on your behalf, you and your agent will need to comply with our agent verification process.  You will be required to verify your identity by providing us with certain personal information, depending on the nature of the information you require, which we will endeavor to match with information we maintain.  Additionally, we will require that you provide us with written confirmation that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf, and the scope of that authorization.  Your agent will also be required to provide us with proof of the agency relationship, which may be a declaration attesting to the agent’s identity and your authorization to act on your behalf, signed under penalty of perjury.   If the agent is a business entity, it will also need to submit evidence that it is registered and in good standing with the California Secretary of State.  Information to identify and verify the agent can be submitted through the same mechanism and at the same time that you submit information to verify your identity.  Please note that this subsection does not apply when an agent is authorized to act on your behalf pursuant to a valid power of attorney.  Any such requests will be processed in accordance with California law pertaining to powers of attorney.
Requests for household information: There may be some types of Personal Information that can be associated with a household (a group of people living together in a single home).  Requests for access or deletion of household Personal Information must be made by each member of the household.
