Privacy Policy
The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., to collect information about your use of the Site, which information your web browser automatically sends to Google. This information includes the URLs of the web sites that you visit and your IP address. Google may also set cookies or read preexisting cookies. This information is stored on Google’s servers. Google uses this information to provide us with reports about Site traffic and your visits to the Site (for example, the domain from which you access the Internet, the web address of the web site from which you linked to the Site, and the date and time of your visit to the web sites that you view and click through). We will use this data to improve the Site’s structure and content. Google may use this data in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which is located at www.google.com/policies/privacy. For more information on how Google uses your data, visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners. You may opt out of our use of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out web siteat tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and installing the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On. Please remember that you will need to opt out for each browser you use. Opting out and otherwise refusing cookies will also limit the collection of analytics data from your use of the Site.
We have enabled the following Google Analytics Advertising Features: Remarketing with Analytics, Demographics and Interest Reporting, and Segments. Remarketing with Analytics uses the Google Analytics cookie to serve advertisements to you across the Internet based on your visit to the Site. Demographics and Interest Reporting uses a third-party cookie to collect information about our Site traffic by tracking users across web sites and across time, which generates a report for us to better understand our Site users. Segments allows us to isolate and analyze subsets of Site users by sorting our Google Analytics data. If you do not want Google to collect or use this information, visit Google’s Safety Center at www.google.com/safetycenter/tools. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site. You can also visit www.networkadvertising.org/choices to change your preferences with respect to certain online ads and to obtain further information about third-party ad networks and behavioral advertising. Please remember that changing your settings with certain browsers and ad networks will not carry your privacy choices across browsers and other ad networks.
We also use Google AdWords, an online advertising service provided by Google, to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Site. Google uses your Internet searches and cookies and similar identifiers (e.g., pixel tags) to collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and your interaction with our products and services to generate targeted advertisements to you on other web sites that you visit across the Internet. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google or to customize your ad preferences, visit Google’s Ad Settings page at www.google.com/settings/ads. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site. If you do not want Google to collect or use this information, visit Google’s Safety Center at www.google.com/safetycenter/tools. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site. To obtain more information about third-party ad networks and online behavioral advertising and to change your preferences with respect to certain online ads, please visit the National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out web site at www.networkadvertising.org choices or the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program web site at www.aboutads.info. Please remember that opting out of online ads with one ad network and web browser does not necessarily carry over to any other ad network or web browser. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time.
