Benefits of  UHY Cybersecurity assessment:
Your Cybersecurity vulnerabilities will be clearly identified
The implications of the exposures will be clarified
Methods of dealing with the vulnerabilities will be presented
Follow-up “Action Plans” will be presented
We can help to identify and protect your critical assets.
5 steps to reduce exposure to Cyberattacks:
1.  Be prepared for an attack.
Ensure that you have the technical resources to detect, contain and respond to an attack.
Check that you have offline daily backups of data applications.
Prepare an “Incident Response Plan”, which identifies what steps to take in the event of a Cyberattack: who to contact and what procedures to follow.
2.  Perform a security assessment to evaluate, detect, respond, and recover.
3.  Conduct awareness training and phishing simulations for all employees on identifying malicious emails and phishing attacks.
The attacks methods look very realistic and employees need to practice identifying malicious emails and need to know what action to take.
4.  Review Cybersecurity insurance coverage. Being aware that many standard insurance plans generally do not provide full coverage.
5.  Ensure that all your application updates are installed.
