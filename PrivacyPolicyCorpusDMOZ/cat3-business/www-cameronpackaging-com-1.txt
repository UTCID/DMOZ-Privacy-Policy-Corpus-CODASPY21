Privacy Policy
Because you value your privacy as much as we value our privacy, no visitor information is sold to or traded with other organizations.
In addition, we will not use your information to contact you in the future and no spam will be emailed.
Your personal information (name, address, email address and phone number, etc.)
and financial information (credit card number, etc.) are used only to process your order.
This sensitive information is not stored on our web server. Your order
information (not the credit card number) is stored in a separate secure
database, not connected to a modem.
It is kept only for accounting purposes.
The only time the information collected will be disclosed, is if we are required
to do so by law.
All online orders are processed using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and are encrypted
before being sent to us. The credit card number is not included in the emailed
portion of the order, as an extra security measure.
Mailing a personal check or money order is offered as a method of payment by our shopping cart.
Our shopping cart server requests permission to set a cookie on your browser
that will be sent back to itself only.
This cookie will not
gather information from your hard drive.
If accepted, the cookie
occupies only a few bytes on your hard drive. The next time you place an order
using our shopping cart, you will not have to type in your name and address again.
You will have to re-enter the payment information, because that is not stored.
We do not partner with any ad server companies, nor do we utilize pop-up ads.
