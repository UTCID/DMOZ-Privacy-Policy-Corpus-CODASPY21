Artificial Intelligence
Go Back
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a suite of technologies capable of learning, reasoning, adapting, and
performing tasks in ways inspired by the human mind. With access to data and the computational power and human ingenuity required to extract increasing value from it, researchers are building intelligent software and machines to enhance human productivity and empower people everywhere. Technology startups and companies have developed AI systems to help solve some of society’s most pressing problems, from medical diagnosis to education to economic productivity and empowerment.
ITI advocates on behalf of our member companies and the larger technology ecosystem for policies that support the spirit of innovation that drives our economy and transforms our world while also ensuring that AI remains inclusive and accessible.
