Home/Privacy policy
Privacy policy
ABRA takes the protection and proper use of your personal data very seriously. We make use of the individual identifying information that you provide to us for the purpose of serving you better. This "Individual identifying information" enables us to identify you, such as your e-mail address, name, title and address. ABRA Electronics uses this individual identifying information in order to personalize your experience on our website and also to be able to selectively send you communications that may be of interest to you, either electronically or otherwise. Our policies regarding the use of your individual identifying information are outlined below:
1. Notice and Disclosure
This Online Privacy Statement is made available to you in order to make you aware of how ABRA Electronics collects and uses individual identifying information of visitors to ABRA Electronics' website. ABRA Electronics collects the following information regarding visitors to our website: information you give us as part of an order, a survey or that you enter on our site, automatically collected information your computer shares when you visit our website or click on an ABRA advertising, and we often collect information about whether you open and/or click on e-mails that we send.
ABRA collects information largely to improve our communication with our customers. ABRA does not share your personal information or email address with any 3rd party or advertisers.
ABRA uses cookie computer technology which places tiny pieces of information on your computer to help identify you and provide an intelligent web site. Enabling cookies on your computer is a requirement for our on-line shopping cart to operate properly.
2. Choice/Consent
You always have the option to opt out of our e-mail and our mailing list. Access to certain ABRA Electronics' web pages requires a login and password. By providing us with your postal address you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, do not hesitate to let us know by unsubscribing to either the postal mail or electronic mail, by e-mail (newsletter@abra-electronics.com), by calling us at 1 (800) 717-2272, or writing to us at the address below. Please let us know if you want to opt out of electronic communication (e-mails), postal communications or both. Please provide us with all necessary information (e-mail, address, account number, telephone) to ensure we can successfully remove you from our list. Please note that it may take up to two business days to process your request and that this will not impact mailings that are in process.
3. Data Security
ABRA Electronics is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information you provide to us. When placing orders, communications between you and ABRA's site are secured using SSL, a de facto standard for Internet security. SSL is an open protocol for secure data communications across computer networks. ABRA uses SSL to secure its on-line catalog so we may provide an environment in which electronic commerce can be conducted and data protected. SSL is application protocol independent and provides encryption, which creates a secured channel to prevent others from tapping into the network; authentication, which uses certificates and digital signatures to verify the identity of parties in information exchanges and transactions; and message integrity, which ensures that messages cannot be altered en route.
4. Data Quality and Access
The accuracy of your individual identifying information is important to ABRA Electronics. Please call us at 1 (800) 717-2272 to make any corrections. We are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information ABRA Electronics maintains about you.
