This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope will be of interest to our users.How do we use your information?Our legal bases for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Notice will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.We will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we will have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you such as where it is necessary to use your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law.If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.How do we determine what our Legitimate Business Interests are?We carry out an assessment to ensure that:(i) Our interest in the use of your data is legitimate (i.e., we have a clear business need); and(ii) The business need, on balance, does not override your privacy rights.When determining this, we assess the potential impact a specific use of the data may have on you as a customer and weigh this against our own business needs to ensure that we get the balance right. We also apply a series of security measures to minimise any potential risks.By way of example in practice we would consider that the collection of our customers’ marketing preferences in the course of a booking is a legitimate business interest to have as an online ecommerce company. We believe that this does not unduly impact your privacy rights as you may, most definitely, want to hear about our products and services going forward. However, to protect your privacy rights we ensure that you can opt out of these communications at any time, in your account, in the email itself or through customer services.In accordance with the legal grounds above, we use the information we collect to:fulfil the transactions that you make, such as for Travellers: booking a property or hotel, or for Owners: to list a property;provide you with travel confirmations and important travel updates for your upcoming trip (via email or SMS);verify your identity for fraud prevention purposes;manage your account, including processing payments;communicate with you in general, particularly if there is a change to your booking;provide customer services related to your booking or to respond to any inquiry you make;facilitate communication between you and Owner;measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website functionality;notify you about special offers, coupons, sweepstakes and travel-related products and services that may be of interest to you. You may receive these by email, post or via advertisements on third-party sites, including through social media;otherwise customize your experience with this website or App;reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join (whether this is our program or that of a third party);obtain information from you, including through feedback you give or surveys you complete;carry out statistical analysis about the use of our website and Apps and the services we offer to improve each aspect of what we do;protect our rights as a company including our intellectual property for example;resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems;prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;enforce our Terms and Conditions; andas otherwise described to you at the point of collection. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at the information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.How do we protect your personal information?We want you to feel confident about using our Online Services to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.

Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.Changes to This Notice and How to Contact UsUpdates to this Privacy PolicyChanges to this Privacy Policy will be made when required in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.
