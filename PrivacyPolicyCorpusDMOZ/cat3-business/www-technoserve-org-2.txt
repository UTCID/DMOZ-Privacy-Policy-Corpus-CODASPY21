Policy Name: Cookies
Approved By: Jeff Chrisfield
Date Approved: 01/01/2020
Effective Date: 12/01/2019
Policy Owner: Jim McKinney
This Cookie Policy describes the different types of cookies and similar technologies that may be applied on the TechnoServe Site and associated subdomains.
Subdomains are as follows:

espanol.technoserve.org
give.technoserve.org
TechnoServe may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the “Effective Date” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised.  Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the website.
What is a Cookie?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. You can find more information about cookies at:
www.allaboutcookies.org
www.youronlinechoices.eu
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently remembering your preferences, and generally improve your website experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’).
Cookies used on this website
TechnoServe (“us”/”our”/”we”) uses first party and third party cookies. We use cookies in order to make this website easier to use, to support the provision of information and functionality to you, as well as to provide us with information about how this website is used so that we can make sure it is as up to date, relevant and error free as we can.
Further information about the types of cookies that are used on this website is set out in TechnoServe’s Data Privacy Statement. To the extent any Personal Information is collected through cookies, the Data Privacy Statement applies and compliments this Cookie Policy.
By continuing to browse the website you are agreeing to our use of cookies and the cookies notice at the top of your browser will disappear. If you block our use of cookies, you may be unable to access certain areas of our website and certain functions and pages will not work in the usual way. Doing so may also affect our ability to update this website to cater for user preferences and improve its performance.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
Strictly necessary cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features and/or services. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the website will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide certain services or features on the website.
