This information may include your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, birth month, email addresses, and web addresses.

Job Applications: If you complete and submit a job application through the Site, we may collect a resume and any other information you submit as part of that application, including your name, email address, desired job title, and location.
Automatically-Collected Information: We collect information about your use of the Site, including the equipment and software you use to access the Site, information about your internet connection, your IP address, mobile device ID, non-personal information (such as demographic information) and other information collected through cookies, web beacons, referrers, or similar tracking technologies.
Cookies: A cookie is a piece of data placed on your hard drive when you visit our Site. Cookies help us track traffic to our Site, which also help us identify what parts of our Site interest visitors most. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site if you do so. Some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies.
Web Beacons: Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Referrers, Mobile Device ID’s, IP Addresses and Environmental Variables: The Fresh Market may also collect information through “referrers,” mobile device IDs, IP addresses and various environmental variables. A “referrer” is information the web browser passes along to The Fresh Market web server that references the URL from which you came. A “mobile device ID” is a number associated with an individual smartphone or similar handheld device which is used to identify and communicate with that device. An “IP Address” is a number used by computers on a network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you. An “environmental variable” may include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed our Site, the type of web browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address or the website you left to visit our Site, the pages you visit while at our Site and the Internet address of the website you then visit.
Information From Third Parties: We may also collect any of the above information from third parties, including from our service providers who help us administer some or all of the Site. We may also obtain lists of potential customers from such sources.
We also maintain an active presence on social media platforms (including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others), where you are free to post comments and other content about our products and services. We reserve the right to post any such comments and content on our Site and/or on our other social media pages.
