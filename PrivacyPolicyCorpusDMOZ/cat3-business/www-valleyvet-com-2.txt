Online Information-Gathering Tools.
We use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, web beacons, and other online information-gathering tools in connection with the Site-including Google advertising cookies and identifiers to enable the collection of Google Analytics data for web traffic on the Site.

We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests.
If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient as if the cookies were enabled.

We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you.
You may opt-out of Google Analytics by following Google's opt-out instructions.
Third-Party Integrated Services.
We may incorporate third-party ads and other third-party content on the Site, and integrate other third-party offerings into the Site, enabling certain such third parties to collect information about you or your online activities across other websites and, over time, through your use of the Site. For example, Google uses cookies to serve the Google Reviews badge on the Site, and to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Site.
You may opt-out of Google's use of cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Site by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page. Except as otherwise described in this privacy policy, any information collected through such integrated technologies is collected directly by these third parties for use by such third parties and other authorized parties, subject to the privacy policies of those other parties.

We may use information we collect about you for a variety of commercial purposes.
For example, we may use such information to:
process payment transactions and provide fraud detection, prevention, and scoring services;

When Information We Collect May Be Disclosed to Third Parties
We disclose to third parties the personal or other information collected about you either (1) when we have otherwise secured your permission to do so, or (2) in any of the following situations, with your permission based on this disclosure:
We may share your order information with select vendors and manufacturers to assist them in their sales and marketing efforts; to facilitate reporting and information sharing regarding adverse drug events and disease control; and to expedite rebate calculation and payment services. For example, we may share the quantities of products you purchase; your full name; your HIN (Health Industry Number); your bill-to and ship-to addresses; your zip code; the date of sale; the invoice number; and the unit quantity and sales price per product and per order.
We may share the information collected about you within the Valley Vet family of companies-which means we may disclose the information collected about you to our affiliates, subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
We may disclose the information collected about you to our third-party contractors and partners in connection with their performance of services or other activities in support of the Site and our businesses, or their completing or confirming on our behalf a transaction or series of transactions that you conduct with us.
For example, your credit or debit card number and expiration date, name, address, transaction amount, chargeback data, browsing and transaction history, computer location, and IP address and related data may be collected and provided to our merchant payment processor and its vendors, agents, suppliers, and contractors for the purpose of processing payment transactions and providing fraud detection, prevention, and scoring services.
Information about you that is collected by third-party ads, content, or technologies integrated with the Site may be disclosed to such third parties.
We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you and other users of the Site without restriction.
In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.
We may disclose to one or more third parties the information collected about you as part of a potential or complete merger, acquisition, or other sale or transfer of any of the assets or business of Valley Vet, or any of our affiliates.
Please note that the entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions may not comply with all of the terms of this privacy policy.
We may disclose information about you to the government or to other third parties to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, and subpoenas or other legal process, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity associated with the Site or our business.
We reserve the right to release information collected through the Site to law enforcement or other government officials, as we determine to be necessary or appropriate.
We may also disclose information about you to third parties if needed to enforce any of the Terms of Use or other agreements for the Site, or any investigation of potential violations of those agreements; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to protect against harm to the Site; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others (for example, to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection).
Security Measures for Information We Collect
To help protect the privacy of information we collect, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices.
In storing such information, we take commercially reasonable steps intended to protect such data against unauthorized access.
But please be aware that the Site is operated on software, hardware, and networks, and any component may experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control that may compromise the security of information collected about you.
Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
Thus, it may be possible for third parties not under Valley Vet's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through the Site or via email.
We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through the Site, but due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization.
Any such transmission of information about you to Valley Vet is at your own risk.
How to Correct or Update Information We Have Collected About You
You may correct or update information we have collected about you by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy, or, if available on the Site, by editing your information and preferences on your Account Information page on the Site.
You may also unsubscribe from any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible.
We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements.
Also, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through the Site that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
The Site does not currently support "Do Not Track" preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information.
Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, the Site is not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set.

Privacy Policies of any Linked Website or Other Parties
This privacy policy only addresses Valley Vet's practices for the personal and other information that we may obtain about you through the Site, or through your other communications with Valley Vet.
Please be aware that when you use or access the Site, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Valley Vet is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, or the content of linked websites.
