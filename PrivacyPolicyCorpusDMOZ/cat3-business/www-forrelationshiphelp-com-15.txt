Who would benefit from listening to these podcasts?
If you answer yes to ANY of the questions below… then YOU would!Is your relationship in crisis?Do you wish you had more confidence? Are you tired of constant Drama?Do you feel comfortable to speak up when you’re put down? Raised by Toxic Parents?Do you know want to have better boundaries? Too much Crazing-Making Conflict?Do you need help to see your relationship clearly? Need help dealing with Relentlessly Difficult People?I’m Dr. Rhoberta Shaler, The Relationship Help Doctor. I offer urgent and ongoing care for relationships in crisis.I’ll bring you new perspectives, insights, and strategies to create healthy, “grown-up” relationships…and to shift away from relationships that are unhealthy, controlling, and dysfunctional.You want to feel equal, to experience reciprocity without score-keeping, to know someone has your back while walking by your side. Because nothing less will do!This is the only podcast devoted to helping you handle those relentlessly difficult people I call “Hijackals®.” Those are people who hijack your relationship for their own purposes. Then, they continually scavenge it for power, status, and control. They leave you feeling gutted, discarded, devalued, and emotionally raped.Talk soon!~~ Rhoberta
You know cannot solve any difficult relationship issues without a serious commitment. It takes time, and it takes real WORK. If you could have done it without help, you would have by now, right?
IF you know you’re ready to do the work, and want help navigating all the steps, I will walk with you, and guide you through the learning that you need to communicate better, understand each other more clearly, and develop personal and relationship boundaries that will keep you on track and build trust again.
