Modern Slavery Act Statement 2020
HomeAbout UsTrust and PrivacyCorporate ConductModern Slavery Act Statement 2020
Parexel International Limited, and its subsidiary companies (together, “Parexel”), is committed to ensuring transparency with its suppliers of goods and services and is mindful as to what steps can be taken, where necessary, to combat slavery and human trafficking. We operate within a very low risk industry. Despite this, throughout calendar year 2020 we have a strategy for further improving our practices.
We are committed to ensuring our employees, indeed all people, have dignity and intrinsic value independent of the work they do. We treat our suppliers, and we treat each other, with respect. We vigilantly strive to meet the needs of those who use our services.
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics includes the following:
“Honest and Ethical Conduct
Employees, officers and directors should endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company’s suppliers, customers, competitors and employees.
Integrity and ethics
Do what's right and demand honesty, maintenance of confidentiality and adherence to professional standards of excellence and safety.
Reporting Procedures
Every employee, officer, and director has the responsibility to ask questions, seek guidance, report suspected violations and express concerns regarding compliance with this Code”
This statement relates to the Parexel companies based in the UK.
ORGANISATION'S STRUCTURE
Parexel International Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parexel International Corporation - this business is registered in the United States of America https://www.parexel.com/)
We provide comprehensive drug development capabilities worldwide. Our global regulatory expertise, Phase I-IV clinical research services, integrated eClinical technologies, and advanced commercialization services all work together to move potential new products through the development journey more smoothly and cost-effectively from beginning to end.
Head office in the UK is located at Hart House, Priestley Road, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RQ24 9PU.
OUR SUPPLY CHAINS
We are a services organisation supporting the biopharmaceutical industry. Although operating in various locations around the world, we believe that the risk of modern slavery for our business, and in our sector, is low. Our employees and contractors are largely professionals who have significant scientific and professional training. Our business is not particularly at risk of slavery and human trafficking. We require our suppliers to comply with all UK laws, rules and regulations.
OUR POLICIES AND TRAINING ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Parexel is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls.
All our employees are required to read and understand the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics so that they can identify behaviour that may violate our policies. Employees are expected to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them. Employees who fail to comply with Parexel’s policies and/or applicable laws and regulations are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we comply with the UK’s employment and social security laws. We do not tolerate slavery or human trafficking. We have complete management visibility of all employees in the UK. Strict control is operated.
SUPPLIER ADHERENCE TO OUR VALUES
We are currently developing a programme whereby all our suppliers will be subject to a due diligence process and regular reviews, as part of our consideration to do business with them.
If at any point a supplier does not meet its obligations, and/ or we suspect or know of slave labour and human trafficking issues, we will discontinue the use of that supplier. This is unlikely to happen given the context of the industry in which we operate.
We have in place systems to:
Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.
Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.
Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
Protect whistle blowers.
Whilst we will have processes in place, it is important to note that we are in the process of liaising with various parties to ensure that slavery and human trafficking issues are sufficiently dealt with, this may mean delegation to others.
We are confident that within our own business there are no issues with slavery and human trafficking and we are committed to preserving our excellent reputation.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for 2020.
