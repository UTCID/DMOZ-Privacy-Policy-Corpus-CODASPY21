This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used and shared when you visit emford.com (the “Site”).
Personal information we collect
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site and information about how you interact with the Site.

“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages and date/time stamps.
“Web beacons,” “tags” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
In addition, if you pay your bill or make another form of financial transaction with the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address and phone number.
