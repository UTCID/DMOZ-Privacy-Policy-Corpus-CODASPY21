GENERAL INFORMATION ON DATA PROCESSING
Scope of personal data processing
We only collect and use personal data of our users as it is improves the functionality of our website, as well as our contents and services. The collection and use of personal data of our users takes place regularly and only with the user's consent. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for real reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Since we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) (a) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
In the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Because the processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.
Data deletion and storage time
The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.

The data is also stored in the log files of our system. The IP addresses of the user or other data that enables the assignment of the data to a user are not affected by this. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.
Legal basis for data processing
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the user's computer. For this, the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.
These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Duration of retention
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The collection of data for the provision of the website occurs until the respective session has ended.

GOOGLE SERVICES
This website uses Google Analytics, YouTube, Google Tag Manager,
Google Maps, and Google Fonts. If your main place of residence is inside
the European Economic Area or Switzerland, these services are provided
to you – unless specified in additional terms and conditions – by Google
Ireland Ltd. ("Google"), a company registered (register number 368047)
and operated under Irish law and headquartered at Gordon House, Barrow
Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
You can find an excerpt of the current terms of use as well as Google’s privacy statement at:
https://policies.google.com/privacy
https://policies.google.com/termsBecause Google operates servers around the world, we cannot rule
out the possibility that personal information will be continue to be
shared with Google LLC, headquartered in the US. Google is certified
under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. You can view the current
certification at www.privacyshield.gov/list. The EU-U.S. Privacy
Shield Framework is an informal agreement in the area of data
protection law negotiated between the European Union and the United
States of America between 2015 and 2016. It consists of a series of
commitments made by the US federal government and a resolution adopted
by the EU Commission. The Commission decided on July 12, 2016, that the
criteria of the Privacy Shield Framework correlate with the European
Union’s data protection requirements. The agreement has been applicable
since that time.
GOOGLE ANALYTICS
This website uses the web analysis tool "Google Analytics." The
purpose of this use is the "demand-oriented design" of this website,
which is carried out on the basis of a balance of interests. Web
analysis also enables us to identify and correct errors on the website,
e.g. through incorrect links. Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies."
These are text files that are stored on your computer that enable an
analysis of your use of the website. "Client IDs" are used to create
pseudonymous user profiles that jointly record the use of the websites
by desktop computers and mobile devices by a user.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of this
website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored
there. However, since we have activated IP anonymization on this website
and concluded a corresponding order-processing agreement with Google,
Google will shorten your IP address within member states of the European
Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European
Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP
address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened
there.
The anonymized IP address sent by your browser through your use of
Google Analytics will not be combined with other data owned by Google.
In these exceptions, your data will be processed in accordance with Art.
6, para. 1f of the GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in
statistical analysis of user behavior for purposes of optimization and
marketing. On our behalf, Google will use that information to evaluate
your use of our website in order to compile reports about website
activities and to provide us with other services in connection with
website and Internet usage.
You can prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the
cookie and data relating to your use of the website (including your IP
address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and
installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
GOOGLE WEB FONTS
We use so-called Google Web fonts on our Internet pages. The fonts
are loaded by servers from Google that provide a better design of the
website. The data processing is based on a balance of interests whereby
our interest lies in an appropriate design of the website.
The relevant fonts are loaded from the Google servers which are
generally located in the USA. The adequate data protection level is
guaranteed by Google within the context of a privacy shield.
SOCIAL MEDIA
We use social media channels as a supplementary service and provide
additional information there. Our website contains links to these social
media channels. We do not use so-called "social Plugins" (such as the
Facebook “Like” button). The links are only included in the web
analysis. We link to our website on the following social media channels:
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/67907
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/FEV-GmbH/171136272897772
Twitter: https://twitter.com/FEV_Europe_GmbH

Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/FEVvideo

extent of data collection and the further processing and use of data by
the relevant social media service can be retrieved from the Internet

RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECTWhere your personal data is processed, you are deemed to be a
data subject as defined in the GDPR and you have the following rights
vis-a-vis the controller:
Right to information
You can request confirmation from the controller regarding whether your personal data is being processed by us.
If such processing has taken place, you can request the following information from the controller:
(1) the purposes for which the personal data is being processed;(2) the categories of personal data being processed;(3) the recipients and/or categories of recipients to whom your personal data has been or will be disclosed;(4) the
planned storage period for your personal data or, if no concrete
information can be provided in this regard, criteria for determining the
storage period;(5) the
existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or
erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data
concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing; (6) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;(7) any available information on the origin of the data if the personal data is not collected from the data subject;(8) the
existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred
to in Art. 22 (1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful
information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and
the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
You have the right to request information about whether your personal
data is transmitted to a non-EU country or an international
organization. In this context, you may request to be informed of the
appropriate guarantees pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR in connection with the
transmission.
Right to rectification
You have a right of rectification and/or completion vis-à-vis the
data controller if the personal data processed concerning you is
incorrect or incomplete. The controller shall make the correction
without undue delay.
Right to restriction of processing
Under the following conditions, you may request that the processing of your personal data be restricted:
(1) if you dispute the accuracy
of the personal data concerning you for a period of time that enables
the data controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;(2) if
the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete the personal data
and instead request that the use of the personal data be restricted;(3) if
the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
the processing, but you do need them to assert, exercise or defend legal
claims, or(4) if
you have objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR pending
the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller
override those of the data subject.
If the processing of your personal data has been limited, this data –
aside from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or in
order to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the
rights of another natural or legal person, or for the sake of an
important public interest of the Union or a member state.
If the processing restriction has been imposed according to the
aforementioned conditions, you will be informed by the data controller
before the restriction is lifted.
Right to deletion
a) Obligation to delete data
You may request the data controller to delete the personal data
relating to you without delay and the controller is obligated to delete
this data without delay if one of the following reasons applies:
(1) The personal data concerning you is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.(2) You
revoke your consent, on which the processing was based, pursuant to
Art. 6 (1) (a) or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR, and there is no other legal basis
for processing. (3) You
file an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR
and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for processing, or you
file an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR. (4) The personal data concerning you has been processed unlawfully. (5) Your
personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in
Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. (6) Your
personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of
information society services referred to in Art. 8 (1) of the GDPR.
b) Information to third parties
If the data controller has made the personal data concerning you
public and is obliged to delete it pursuant to Art. 17 (1) GDPR, it
shall take appropriate measures, including technical measures, taking
into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to
inform data processors who process the personal data that you, as the
data subject, have requested the deletion of, all links to this personal
data, or of copies or replications of the personal data.
c) Exemptions
The right to deletion does not exist insofar as the processing is necessary
(1) for exercising freedom of expression and information;(2) for
compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union
or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller;(3) for reasons of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to Art. 9 (2) (h) and (i) and Art. 9 (3) GDPR;(4) for
archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1)
GDPR, insofar as the law referred to under a) is likely to render
impossible or seriously impair the attainment of the objectives of such
processing, or(5) to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
Right to notification
If you have exercised your right to have the data controller
corrected, deleted or limit the processing, it is obliged to inform all
recipients to whom the personal data concerning you has been disclosed
of this correction or deletion of the data or restriction on processing,
unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
You have the right to be informed by the data controller of such recipients.
Right to data transferability
You have the right to receive your personal data that you have
provided to the controller in a structured, conventional, and
machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to pass this
data on to another controller without hindrance by the controller to
whom the personal data was provided, as long as
(1) the processing is based on a
declaration of consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)
(a) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR and(2) processing is carried out using automated methods.
In exercising this right, you also have the right to request that
your personal data be transferred directly from one data controller to
another, insofar as this is technically feasible. This should not impair
other people's freedoms or rights.
The right to transferability shall not apply to the processing of
personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the public
interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
controller.
Right to object
On grounds relating to your particular situation, You have the right
to object, at any time, to the processing of your personal data based on
Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR, including profiling based on those
provisions.
The data controller no longer processes the personal data concerning
you unless it can prove compelling, legitimate reasons for the
processing, which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the
processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
If your personal data is being processed for the purpose of direct
marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of
your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this also
applies to profiling where this is connected to such direct marketing.
If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, your
personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.
You have the opportunity to exercise your right of objection in
connection with the use of Information Society services by means of
automated procedures using technical specifications, notwithstanding
Directive 2002/58/EC.
Right to revoke the declaration of consent on data protection
You have the right to revoke your data protection declaration of
consent at any time. Revoking your consent will not affect the legality
of any processing that took place before the revocation.
Automated decision in individual cases including profiling
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based exclusively
on automated processing – including profiling – that has legal effect
against you or significantly impairs you in a similar manner. This does
not apply if the decision
(1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller,(2) is
admissible by law of the Union or of the Member States to which the
controller is subject and that law contains appropriate measures to
safeguard your rights, freedoms and legitimate interests, or(3) with your express consent.
However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of
personal data pursuant to Art. 9 (1) GDPR, unless Art. 9 (2) (a) or (g)
applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect your rights
and freedoms and your legitimate interests.
In the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller shall take
reasonable measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms and legitimate
interests, including, at minimum, the right to obtain the intervention
of a person by the controller, to state his or her point of view and to
challenge the decision.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you
have the right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in
the Member State where you reside, work, or where the suspected
infringement took place, if you believe that the processing of your
personal data is contrary to the GDPR.
The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged
shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint,
including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.
