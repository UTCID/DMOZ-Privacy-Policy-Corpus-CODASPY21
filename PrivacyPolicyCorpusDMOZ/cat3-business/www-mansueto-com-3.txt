USE AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY ADVERTISERS AND SPONSORS; THIRD PARTY COOKIES AND TRACKING TOOLS
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on the Websites. These advertising companies may collect and use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to the Websites and other websites not owned and operated by us, and may also combine this information with other data about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may interest you (as inferred from your online activity).
We also share usage information about Users of the Websites with these companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on the Websites and other websites. For these purposes, we and our third party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit on the Websites through the use of GIFs. In the course of serving advertisements to the Websites, our third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique 'cookie' on your computer. The Websites may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of affiliate entities or of advertisers or sponsors who are companies that are not owned or operated by us, or our affiliates or subsidiaries. These entities may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies and/or clear GIFs to our Users. The data collected is used in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to Users of the Websites and other interactive media and may be used to keep track of user response to each advertisement. We also work with third-party data analytics and online targeting companies. Some of these companies may use non-personal information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide data and targeting recommendations based on which we may provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Many of the third-party companies we work with are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). The NAI and the DAA have developed tools that allow consumers to opt out of targeted advertising delivered by members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tools, go to The Digital Advertising Alliance's WebChoices Tool and the National Advertising Initiative's Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising.
Following are the names and websites of some of the other companies who may set cookies on the Websites to serve or present the ads that appear on the Websites and to conduct research about the advertisements. You may learn about opting out of their targeted advertising programs by going to their respective websites.
