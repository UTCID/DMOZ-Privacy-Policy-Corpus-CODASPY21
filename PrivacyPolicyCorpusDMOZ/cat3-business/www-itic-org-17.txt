Cybersecurity
Go Back
The protection of our digital information and systems – is a priority for alignment by both private industry and governments globally. Our companies work to secure the technology systems that citizens use to improve their lives and the digital infrastructure our economy depends upon for unprecedented opportunities and prosperity. Cybersecurity is also increasingly intertwined with privacy because it protects sensitive information. Because of this, technology companies are highly motivated to design and build security into their products and systems.
ITI supports policies that increase security while maintaining the benefits cyberspace provides. ITI works to ensure that cybersecurity policies in the United States and around the world reflect the interconnected and interoperable global nature of today’s digital environment. In order to secure cyberspace, ITI advocates for cybersecurity policies that are adaptable to rapidly emerging threats, technologies, and business models; are based on effective risk management, and leverage public-private partnerships.
In-Depth: NIST Framework
ITI contributed to and strongly supports the Framework for Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Framework), issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in February 2013.
