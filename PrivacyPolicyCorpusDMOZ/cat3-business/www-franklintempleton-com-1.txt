U.S. resident use only. This Site is intended for residents of the United States only. If you choose to access this Site from locations outside of the United States, you do so at your own initiative and risk, and are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.

You agree to accept responsibility for all activities occurring under your account or password that are due to your conduct, inaction, or negligence. Notify us immediately if you become aware of any disclosure, loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password.
No solicitations.

Unless otherwise specified, you alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.
Prohibited Uses and Means of Access
Prohibited Uses. Because all servers have limited capacity and are used by many people, you may not use the Site in any manner that could damage or overburden any Franklin Templeton server, or any network connected to any Franklin Templeton server. You may not use the Site in any manner that would interfere with any other party's use of the Site.
Means of Access. The Site is generally intended to be viewed by a conventional web browser with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels or greater, such as Microsoft® Internet Explorer® 7.0 or above, Firefox® 3.0 or above, or Safari® 3.0 and above. Although you may use other means to access the Site, be aware that the Site may not appear accurately through other access methods, and you use them only at your own risk. You are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure that you are receiving the most recent data. You should not access the Site through devices or services that are designed to provide high-speed, automated, repeated access, unless such devices are approved by us.
Password protected areas. Access to and use of password-protected and/or secure areas of the Site are restricted to authorized users only. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain unauthorized access to such parts of our Site, or to any other protected materials or information, through any means not intentionally made available by us for your specific use. Unauthorized individuals attempting to access, or actually accessing, these areas can be subject to criminal and/or civil prosecution.
Fund Prospectus Offer, Performance, and Investment Risks
Prospectus Offer. For more information on any of our funds offered in your state, contact your registered representative (financial advisor) or download a prospectus, which contains important information about a fund's investment goals, sales charges, expenses and risk considerations. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.
Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. One Franklin Parkway San Mateo, CA 94403-1906
Fund Performance. Investment return and principal value for our Funds will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Money market funds seek to maintain a value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will. Mutual funds, annuities and other investment products are not FDIC insured; are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by, any financial institution; and are subject to risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.
Investment Risks. All of the funds are subject to certain risks. Generally, investments offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk.
Stocks and other equities representing an ownership interest in a corporation have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term but tend to fluctuate more dramatically over the shorter term. Bonds, and other debt obligations, are affected by the creditworthiness of their issuers and changes in interest rates, with prices often declining as interest rates increase. High yield, lower rated ("junk") bonds generally have greater price swings and higher default risks. Foreign investing, especially in developing countries, has additional risks such as currency, market volatility, and political and social instability.
These risks, and other risks that particular funds may be subject to, such as specialized industry sectors or use of complex securities, are discussed in each fund's prospectus.
Section 529 College Savings Plans
Disclosure Document Offer. For more information on any of the Section 529 college savings plans we distribute ("529 Plan(s)"), contact your registered representative (financial advisor) or download a disclosure document, which contains important information about the plan's investment options, sales charges, expenses and risks. Please read the disclosure document carefully before you invest or send money.
Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. One Franklin Parkway San Mateo, CA 94403-1906
529 Plan Performance, Characteristics, and Risks. Investment return and principal value of investments in the 529 Plans will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or a loss upon sale. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The 529 Plan interests are municipal securities issued by a state agency, and not shares in a mutual fund, although plan portfolios may invest in mutual funds. If you pay state taxes in states other than those offering the 529 Plans, you should consider whether your state offers a plan with alternative tax advantages for its residents. Before investing in a 529 Plan, consult with your financial advisor.

Third Party Content Providers, Sites, Referrals, and Disclaimers
Conditions may apply to third party content. Some of the products, services, content, including advertisements, tools, and information available through the Site may be provided by companies that are not affiliated with Franklin Templeton ("Third Party Content") and their source is clearly identified. In some cases, the Third Party Content may be framed-in on the Franklin Templeton Site or available through a link to a third party site. In the case of Third Party Content, there may be additional restrictions that apply to its use. You should be careful to examine them (for example, in accompanying statements or caveats or their posted terms of use) because they may be more restrictive than the restrictions Franklin Templeton imposes on our own, proprietary Site Content. Third Party Content providers may have reserved a right to modify the restrictions they impose on use of their content without notice. As with our Site's Terms of Use, use of Third Party Content after a change in the posted restrictions relating to that content will constitute acceptance of those changes.
Not responsible for Third Party Content, referrals or links to third parties or third party sites. For informational or educational purposes, or as a service and convenience to you, this Site may provide referral information, Third Party Content or live links to a regulatory agency, non-profit organization, or other unaffiliated third party and their websites, including companies that have a relationship with Franklin Templeton.
Our decision to provide referral information to a third party or to pass on an offer made by a third party vendor or to provide a link from our Site to a third party site is not an endorsement of the third party, their products or services, or their website accessed through any such links. While we would generally only provide such information from, or links to, sources considered reliable, we do not have the resources to conduct independent investigations and accordingly we make no representations or warranties as to third party products, services, content, tools and information, and do not guarantee their accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness. We advise and encourage you to do your own research. You will use Third Party Content only at your own risk.
Although Third Party Content may be displayed, framed-in or provided in a pop-up box on the Site, or available through a live link from our Site to a third party site, Franklin Templeton does not prepare, edit, guarantee or endorse Third Party Content. By clicking on a link from our Site to any third party site, you will leave this Site (even if, for your convenience, a second browser window is opened). When viewing Third Party Content through such a link, keep in mind that the third party's site terms and conditions, privacy and security policies, or other legal information may be different from those of Franklin Templeton's Site. We are not liable for any direct or indirect technical or system issues, consequences, or damages arising from your use of any third party website. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY, THEIR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THEIR WEBSITE, OR ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH SUCH THIRD PARTY SITES, NOR DO WE MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THIRD PARTY CONTENT (OR ITS ACCURACY) ON ANY THIRD PARTY SITES, AND WE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER IN RELATION TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING.
Disclaimers
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NONE OF FRANKLIN TEMPLETON, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES") GUARANTEES THE TIMELINESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY OF THE SITE. NONE OF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES WARRANT THAT THIS SITE OR DOWNLOADS WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS, OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR FREE OR THAT THIS SITE, ITS SERVER OR ANY FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING THROUGH THIS SITE ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL ELEMENTS.

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS SITE AND THE TIMELINESS, USEFULNESS, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SITE IS ASSUMED SOLELY BY YOU. ALL OF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, ENDORSEMENTS, GUARANTEES, OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THIS SITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, ALL OF THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON PARTIES DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THIS SITE.
You are responsible for your connectivity. You agree that you are responsible for the means you use to access the Site and understand that your hardware, software, the Internet, your Internet Service Provider, and other third parties involved in connecting you to our Site may not perform as intended or desired.
Not responsible for third party damages.

For example, you understand that hackers could breach our security procedures, and that Franklin Templeton will not be responsible for any related damages.
No reliance on Data. Reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure that Site Content, including account information and pricing data, are complete and accurate. However, due to the nature of information delivery technology and the necessity of using multiple data sources, including Third Party Content, we are unable to assure the accuracy of the data you access through this Site. Site Content is presented only as of the date published or indicated and may be superseded by subsequent market events or other reasons. Franklin Templeton has no duty to update this Site or any Site Content. WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY ACTIONS OR INVESTMENT DECISIONS TAKEN BY YOU BASED ON THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA PRESENTED THROUGH THIS SITE.
Cautions about future or "forward-looking" statements. Speculation or stated beliefs about future events, such as market and economic conditions, company or security performance, upcoming product offerings or other projections are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve risks and uncertainties. General business, market, economic and political conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we presently anticipate or project.
Internet email. We discourage you from using e-mail for sending confidential or sensitive information. If you send e-mail (encrypted or not) to us over the Internet, you are accepting the associated risks of lack of confidentiality.
Limitation of Liability
YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SITE IS TO STOP USING THE SITE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
