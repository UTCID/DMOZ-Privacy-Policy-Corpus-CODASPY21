NOT A LENDER
This website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to lend. The Operator of this website is NOT A LENDER, does not make loan or credit decisions, and does not broker loans. The operator of this Web Site is not an agent, representative or broker of any lender and does not endorse or charge you for any service or product. This website provides a service only and is not acting as a representative, agent, or correspondent for any service provider or lender. This website's aim is to inform users of possible lenders who may be able to satisfy the needs of a particular consumer.
LOAN AMOUNTS
If your application is for a short-term loan, not all short-term lenders can provide up to $1,000; if you are applying for an installment loan, not all installment loan lenders can provide up to $2,500. Cash transfer times may vary between lenders and in some circumstances faxing may be required. Completion of this application in no way guarantees that you may be processd for a cash advance offer. This service is not available in all states and the states serviced by this Website may change from time to time and without notice.
REPRESENTATIVE APR RANGE
www.wirelend.com is not a lender and does not provide short-term or installment loans but refers consumers to lenders who may provide such loans. www.wirelend.com is unable to supply you with an exact APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that you may be charged if you are processd for a loan. APRs vary according to the information supplied by you in your loan request and your lender. You may be given the APR, loan fees, and other terms by your lender when you are redirected to your loan agreement in the loan request process.
The APR on a short-term or installment loan can range from 200% to 2,290% depending on how the APR is calculated (nominal vs. effective), the duration of the loan, loan fees incurred, late payment fees, non-payment fees, loan renewal actions, and other factors. Keep in mind that the APR range is not your finance charge and your finance charge may be disclosed later on.

IMPLICATIONS OF NON-PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
www.wirelend.com is not a lender and does not charge any fees for its services. Every lender in the www.wirelend.com network provides the consumer with specific terms, conditions, and practices prior to the consumer’s acceptance of the loan. We recommend that you carefully review the terms and conditions of any loan offer presented to you.
IMPLICATIONS OF NON-PAYMENT, LATE PAYMENT, OR PARTIAL PAYMENT
When you accept the terms and conditions for a loan offer, you are agreeing to pay back the loan principal and finance charges in the amount of time shown in the documents supplied by your lender. Additional fees or charges by your lender may apply in the event that you are unable to repay your loan in full or if you make a late payment. www.wirelend.com cannot predict the amount of the fees or charges that you may incur as a result of non-payment, late payment, or partial payment. www.wirelend.com has no control of knowledge of the loan details between you and your lender. Please refer to the late payment, partial payment, and non-payment policies detailed in the loan documents provided by your lender. www.wirelend.com does make an effort to work only with reputable lenders dedicated to pursuing collections of past due accounts in a fair and reasonable manner.
FEES AND INTEREST
If processed for a loan, your lender may present you with the exact fees and interest rate of your loan prior to your acceptance of the loan. www.wirelend.com is not a lender and cannot predict the exact fees and interest of the loan option presented to you. You are under no obligation to accept the terms presented to you by the lender.
CREDIT SCORE IMPACT
www.wirelend.com does not make credit decisions nor does www.wirelend.com conduct a credit inquiry on consumers. Some lenders on the www.wirelend.com network may conduct a non-traditional credit check in order to determine your eligibility for a loan. Lenders typically do not conduct a credit inquiry with the three major credit bureaus: Transunion, Experian, or Equifax. Ultimately, your credit score may or may not be affected by the actions of a particular lender. If you do not repay your loan on time your lender may report this delinquency to one or more credit bureaus, which could have a negative impact on your credit score. We encourage consumers with credit problems to consult a Credit Counseling company.
RENEWAL POLICY INFORMATION
Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. Every Lender has its own renewal policy, which may differ from Lender to Lender. The loan renewal options may be presented to you by your lender prior to your acceptance of the loan. Please make sure to diligently read the renewal policy presented to you prior to signing the loan documents. Short-term and installment loans are intended to be a short term financial instrument. www.wirelend.com encourages all consumers to repay the loan on time and in full in order to avoid late payment and/or non-payment fees. If you suspect that you may be unable to pay off a short-term or installment loan we would recommend that you explore other loan alternatives before applying for a short-term or installment loan.
