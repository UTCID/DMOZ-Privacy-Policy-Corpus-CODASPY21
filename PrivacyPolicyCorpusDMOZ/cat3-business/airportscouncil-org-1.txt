Legal Affairs Committee
The Legal Affairs Committee provides airport attorneys with a forum to share information about new developments in case law, statutes and regulations affecting airports; the Committee also monitors pending airport litigation.  Through its steering group, recommendations are made to the ACI-NA Board and Executive Committee regarding requests that ACI-NA file “friend of the court” briefs at the appellate stage of cases in federal and state court, where those cases are likely to have significant implications for U.S. airports.  The Committee reviews and edits draft briefs prior to filing.
In addition, the Committee drafts and edits comments filed in proceedings pending before administrative agencies of the federal government, and assists ACI-NA in informal discussions with those federal agencies.  The Committee, through the ACI-NA staff, maintains for the use of its members, sample language for various airport legal documents, e.g., policies, RFP’s, minimum standards, easements, etc.  The Legal Affairs Committee also responds to requests from the ACI-NA Executive Committee, Board of Directors, and other ACI-NA departments for information regarding legal issues affecting airports, and provides speakers to other ACI-NA committees on a variety of airport legal issues.
Finally, the Committee plans two important conferences for its members, held in the spring and fall annually. These conferences update airport lawyers throughout North America on the most pressing legal, regulatory and litigation issues facing airports. Speakers usually include private practitioners, airport attorneys and leading government regulatory officials from key agencies involved in airport and aviation issues.
