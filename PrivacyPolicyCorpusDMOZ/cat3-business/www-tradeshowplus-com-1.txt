Terms, Conditions & Privacy Policy
All users of this site agree that access to and use of this site are subject to the following terms and conditions and other applicable law. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this website.
Custom Printed Graphics
All orders receive a digital e-proof prior to order production. E-Proofs are designed to verify graphic placement and grammar only.
E-Proofs cannot be used to judge resolution or color output. Hard proofs must be ordered to properly judge color output. A hard proof
is a printed sample using the same printer and material as the product being ordered. Hard proofs are generally a mini print along
with a full size cropped section of part of the art file. Hard proof cost is $100.00 per proof and includes overnight shipment.
Although ordering hard proofs adds to the cost and production time, it is the ONLY way to ensure that color output will be acceptable.
Clients who waive hard proofs for any reason also waive their right to reprints.
Shipping
TradeShowPlus Incorporated will not be held liable for missed event dates due to carrier delay issues. We institute quality and production
controls to ensure orders are produced and shipped on time. Unfortunately, we have no control over delivery of orders once they leave our
production facilities. Once an order is picked up by the carrier the responsibility for order timely delivery falls on the carrier.
Upon the acceptance of delivery, you agree that the package(s) have arrived without any visible shipping damage. If shipping damage is
noted, sign for the delivery as damaged and contact TradeShowPlus Incorporated immediately. Failure to sign for the package(s) as damaged,
refusal of the package, or neglecting to note after 3 business days any damage that may have occurred during the shipping process will be
treated as a warranty claim and are subject to the terms and conditions of our warranty. The option to issue a return label/call tag is at
the discretion of TradeShowPlus Incorporated for any warranty or claim situation and any product outside of 72 hours will not have the
option for a return label/call tag.
Any errors occurred during the shipping/freight process that shipped under the TradeShowPlus Incorporated prepaid freight service will
be guaranteed and covered should the shipper lose, damage or delay a product outside their guaranteed delivery time. TradeShowPlus
Incorporated will process the claim information and replace the affected product. For orders shipped using a customer’s shipper number or
a third party shipper number, the customer will be responsible for replacing the affected product at cost and following through with the
claim through the shipping/freight company. TradeShowPlus Incorporated will begin the claim process and provide the customer with the claim
information. Any further claim correspondence will be between the customer and the shipping/freight company.
TradeShowPlus Incorporated reserves the right to request documentation in the forms of photos, copies of packing slips and the like to
ensure the issue is resolved promptly. “Standard questions” may also be asked in order to provide accurate and timely customer service.
Failure to provide the necessary information requested by a TradeShowPlus Incorporated representative may delay the claim process. An
RMA/Case number may be issued depending on the warranty/claim. This number must be used in regards to all correspondence with the issue
and adhered to any packaging sent to TradeShowPlus Incorporated for assessment. Failure to adhere RMA/Case information to a package will
delay the claim/warranty process.
Product Returns
Should you need to return a product due to order cancellation or any reason other than a warranty matter, TradeShowPlus Incorporated
reserves the right to carry out a full inspection of the product before accepting the return. All returns of this nature must be noted
to a TradeShowPlus Incorporated representative 72 hours after receipt of the product and are susceptible to a 25% restocking fee/charge.
Customers returning items will not receive a refund on original outgoing shipment costs. Return shipping costs will be the responsibility of the customer. TradeShowPlus Incorporated will not accept the return of a used or custom made product or graphic. Product should be returned in the
manner in which it was received.
Order cancellations must be confirmed and approved by a TradeShowPlus Incorporated representative. The cancellation of a production
order for which TradeShowPlus Incorporated has produced or ordered raw materials may result in TradeShowPlus Incorporated fully charging
for materials and labor, or imposing a minimum cancellation fee of up to 50% of the purchase/sale price.
TradeShowPlus Incorporated reserves the right to change prices or product designs as well as discontinue a product at any time without
further notice. If a product is noted as defective that is a discontinued product; an exchange to an equivalent product will be offered or
an upgrade to a premium product (at the discretion of TradeShowPlus Incorporated) will be available with the customer responsible for the
difference in cost.
Warranty
