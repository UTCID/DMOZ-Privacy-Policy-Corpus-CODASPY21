OTHER
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Crowe Soberman LLP infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to Crowe Soberman LLP a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon Crowe Soberman LLP actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to Crowe Soberman LLP a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details.  Crowe Soberman LLP’s Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached at Crowe Soberman LLP.
The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of 13, nor does it contain information which would be potentially harmful to minors in any way. However, all visitors to the Website under the age of 13 should not disclose or provide any Personally Identifiable Information.  In the event that Crowe Soberman LLP discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personally Identifiable Information to us, we will delete the child's Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Please see the Federal Trade Commission's website for this act.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections are commercially available to assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. More information on the availability of such software can be found through publicly available sources. You may wish to contact your Internet Service Provider for more information.
APPLICABLE LAW
Any dispute, controversy or difference which may arise between the parties out of, in relation to or in connection with these Terms of Use is hereby irrevocably submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Crowe Soberman LLP (or through arbitration as set forth below), applying Crowe Soberman LLP law, regardless of principles of conflicts of laws.  You agree to waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum defenses for purposes of resolving disputes hereunder.
BINDING ARBITRATION
You and Crowe Soberman LLP agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and Crowe Soberman LLP or its members and affiliates (except disputes relating to the enforcement of Crowe Soberman LLP's or its affiliates’ intellectual property rights).  You and Crowe Soberman LLP empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these Terms of Use, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.
In the event of a dispute, you or Crowe Soberman LLP must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute and the relief requested.  You and Crowe Soberman LLP will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or we may commence arbitration.  You may also litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.  EXCEPT FOR CASES DECIDED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
If you and Crowe Soberman LLP do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision may be final except for a potentially limited right of appeal. Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. For more information, visit www.adr.org or, in the United States, call 800-778-7879.  Arbitration may be conducted in person in Canada, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. You and Crowe Soberman LLP agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Canada, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
NO CLASS ACTIONS
PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  Neither you nor Crowe Soberman LLP will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.  No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.
WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY
No waiver by Crowe Soberman LLP of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by Crowe Soberman LLP to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT
These Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between Crowe Soberman LLP and users of the Site, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Site.
