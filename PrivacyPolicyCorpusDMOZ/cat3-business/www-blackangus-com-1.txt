HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
How we protect your information
The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to us.  We have technical, administrative, and physical security measures in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and improper use.
For example, we use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to protect the data collection forms on our website. In addition, access to your personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. All employees with access to personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. After a new policy is added, these employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to enhance protection for our customers’ personal information.  In addition, the servers that we use to store personal information are kept in a secure, restricted access area.
Password Protection. Certain areas of our site is password protected. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords. We have the right to assume that anyone accessing one of our site using a password assigned to you has the right to do so. You will be solely responsible for the activities of anyone accessing our site using a password assigned to you, even if the individual is not, in fact authorized by you. If you have reason to believe that your account password has been compromised or used without authorization, you must promptly change it using the functionality provided on the site.  It is also important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and any password that permits access to it. Be sure to log out of your account or to close your browser after you have completed your visit to our site.
