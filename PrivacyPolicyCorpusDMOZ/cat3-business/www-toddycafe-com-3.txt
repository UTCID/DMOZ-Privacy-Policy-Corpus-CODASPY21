All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email. We are not responsible for typographical, or other errors in any offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors.

5. Returns and Refunds. Except for any products designated on the Site as non-returnable, we will accept a return of the products for exchange, credit or refund of your purchase price, less the original shipping and handling costs, provided such return is made within 30 days of shipment and provided such products are returned in their original condition, with all parts and accessories.
Consumables such as filters and stoppers must be unopened to qualify for return.
To return products, carefully repackage items for return in original or secure packaging and send to Toddy, LLC Returns Department, 3706 Aldrin Drive, Loveland, CO 80538.

Refunds are processed within approximately 7-10 business days of our receipt of your merchandise, but we do not guarantee that refunds will be processed within this time period. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original purchase on the Site.
Items that require cleaning, new packaging, parts, or do not meet the requirements of the Return Policy, may still be accepted for return in our sole and absolute discretion and may carry a restocking fee of up to 20%. We offer no refunds on any products designated on the Site as non-returnable.
6. LIMITED WARRANTY ON PRODUCTS
WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE A WRITTEN WARRANTY IN THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT PACKAGING, FOR WHICH THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTY ARE SET FORTH EXCLUSIVELY IN THE WRITTEN WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT PACKAGING. ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.
7. Goods Not for Resale or Export. You represent and warrant that you are buying products or services from the Site for your own personal or household use only, and not for resale or export. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations of any state and of the United States with respect to these products or services.
8. Privacy. Our Privacy Policy, available at https://toddycafe.com/privacy-policy, governs the processing of all personal data collected from you in connection with your purchase of products or services through the Site.
9.
Force Majeure. We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in our performance under these Terms when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown or power outage.
10.
Governing Law and Jurisdiction. All matters arising out of or relating to these Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Colorado without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Colorado or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Colorado.
(a)
EXCEPTING ONLY DISPUTES THAT ARISE FROM OR RELATE TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF TODDY, LLC'S TRADEMARKS, ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
YOU AND TODDY ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
(b)
The arbitration will be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") or the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), or such other arbitration service mutually agreed to by the parties. The location of the arbitration will be in the County of Denver, Colorado.
The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(c)
If your claim is one that may be resolved in small claims court, you may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide us with written notice of your intention do so within 60 days of your purchase. The arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy.
(d)
You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR TODDY WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.
12.
Assignment. You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this section is null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your obligations under these Terms.
13.
No Waivers. The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Toddy.
14.
No Third-Party Beneficiaries. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you.
15.
Notices.
(a)
To You. We may provide any notice to you under these Terms by: (i) sending a message to the email address you provide or (ii) by posting to the Site. Notices sent by email will be effective when we send the email and notices we provide by posting will be effective upon posting. It is your responsibility to keep your email address current.

Notices provided by overnight courier will be effective one business day after they are sent. Notices provided by registered or certified mail will be effective three business days after they are sent.
16.
Severability. If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.
17.
Entire Agreement. Our order confirmation, these Terms, and the Privacy Policy will be deemed the final and integrated agreement between you and us on the matters contained in these Terms.
