Privacy & Cookies
Privacy Policy | Lhasa OMS Inc.
LhasaOMS.com is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information when you visit our website.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal information, and how we secure that information. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can help ensure the safe collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. By using the LhasaOMS website, you are accepting the terms and conditions described in our Privacy Policies.
Personal Information that LhasaOMS Collects
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and improve your experience with LhasaOMS.com.
We do not collect personal information about individuals, such as names and mailing or e-mail addresses, unless the individual visiting the LhasaOMS website knowingly provides it.
When you place an order, we need to know your name, your profession, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card number and expiration date so we can fulfill your order. Your credit card information will be stored temporarily on a secured server and used only as needed to process your transaction. We will retain your personal information in order to facilitate better customer service, and to inform you of new products and special sales.
If you do not wish to be notified, you may opt out at any time. If you are only requesting a catalog we will just need to know your name, profession and shipping address.
How We Protect your Personal Information
LhasaOMS secure server software uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. SSL encodes your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, as it travels over the Internet so that all transactions are secure. . You can tell you are in secure mode by looking at the URL in your browser. If there is an 's' after the 'http', you know you are in secure mode
In addition, we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card number when we confirm your order by email.
We are determined to protect your information (including personally identifiable information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, but you should understand that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. While we take rigorous precautions to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
How You Can Help Protect your Personal Information
You can help protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by choosing a complex password and changing it periodically. Be sure also to use a known and trusted connection and to log off when finished using a shared computer. Use of Cookies
Cookies are small files of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your Web browser. They allow our system to recognize your device and to provide commonly-used features such as 1-click purchasing or the storage of items in a shopping cart between site visits. The cookies we use do not contain any personal information. And they cannot infiltrate your hard drive to gather confidential information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change the preferences of your browser so that it does not accept them. Doing so, however, will limit access to some essential features when using the LhasaOMS website.
Online Surveys
From time to time, LhasaOMS may invite you to participate in surveys posted on our website or sent to you by e-mail. You may decide whether or not you wish to complete such surveys, which may ask about your background, profession, range of clients, or your use of our website. We use this information to help us better meet your needs and interests. Information collected in these surveys is never sold, rented or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.
Emailing LhasaOMS
If you email LhasaOMS your message and email address may be saved and we may send you emails in response to your message. Any material, business information, ideas, concepts or other information sent to LhasaOMS by email will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. We will only use the information provided in your e-mail and your e-mail address to improve our website, services and products,
and to fulfill or respond to your requests for products, services or information.
Use of information LhasaOMS collects on its Website
LhasaOMS uses the personal information you provide to us for internal purposes, such as completing and tracking your transaction, analyzing trends and collecting aggregate statistics. These statistics and analyses will never include any personally identifying information.
Like all catalog and Internet retailers, we must often use others to perform specific tasks for us.
For example, in order to deliver products to you, we must share some information (name. shipping address, telephone number or email) with the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service, or Federal Express to ensure delivery. And we must obviously also provide your credit card number to financial-services corporations such as credit-card processors and issuers. We will also release account and other personal information when we determine we must comply with the law, or protect the rights, property, or safety of LhasaOMS or others. This includes exchanging information with law enforcement officials, or with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
Revisions to our Privacy Policies
LhasaOMS may revise its privacy policy at any time, without notice.
Changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the LhasaOMS website. Such changes may come about in response to changes in the law, policies , or other factors.
We encourage you to visit this page periodically to note our most current policy.
