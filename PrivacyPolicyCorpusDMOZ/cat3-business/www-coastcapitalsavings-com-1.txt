What if I'm a victim?
Coast Online Banking offers you the best security currently available for an online banking site. Any personal or transactional information transmitted between you and Coast Online Banking is secure and cannot be read by anyone else.
We protect you by having:
Controlled access to our member’s information, financial systems and databases
Industry standard firewalls, hardware and devices that are actively logged, monitored and physically secured
We ensure that information in transit between your PC and our Home Banking Server cannot be read or changed
Account access restricted to authorized members with their member-chosen Username and Password
Online banking sessions that time-out automatically if there has been no activity for 15 minutes
What are automatic session time-outs?
Coast Online Banking has been designed to end your session automatically. If the system detects that you have been inactive for 15 minutes or more, you will be required to re-login.
How do I know I'm on a safe website?
If you're using a high security web browser like Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or similar browser then you’ll notice a green highlight in your address bar like the one below when you visit our site to indicate that it has an Extended Validation SSL certificate. This lets you know that you're on the real Coast Capital Savings website.
What else can I do to protect myself?
It’s important to keep your web browser up-to-date as they’ll contain the latest security features to protect you when you’re online. Find out where to download the latest versions on our browser requirements page.
Mobile banking safety
We aren’t going to hire a bodyguard to carry your mobile phone around for you, but we are making sure that Coast Mobile Banking is keeping your information safe and secure.
How we protect you
Same security levels as Coast Online® Banking
Just like Coast Online® Banking, we’ll ask you to log in with your member card number and your personal access code. As well, all mobile banking information is transmitted via 256-bit encryption technology as it moves from your mobile device to our systems. Since we use the same security precautions for mobile banking as we do for Coast Online® Banking, no personal or banking information is saved on your phone. Coast Mobile Banking uses the industry's best practices in security.
Privacy Options - disable features if you're not using them
Coast Mobile Banking offers the option to disable features such as Quickview and Saved Member Cards to further reduce the amount of personal data viewable and securely stored on your device.
No login required (for Text and Alerts)
You don’t need to log in to Coast Online Banking to access your account information. This means your login information is kept safe.
We don’t use your account number (for Text and Alerts)
When we send you a text message or an email through Coast Mobile Banking, we only use the nicknames that you’ve set up. We’ll never send your account number, so you don’t have to worry about this information being stored in your phone.
How you can protect yourself
Know your security options
Be sure to use the security options available on your device such as enabling password protection, and disabling your Bluetooth connection when you are not using it to prevent attackers from taking advantage of that connection. Refer to your phone's user manual or contact your mobile carrier for more information on these features.
Only download apps from trusted sources
Only download trusted applications from reputable sources such as iTunes for the iPhone.
Avoid using public wireless access points to access your online banking
Avoid where possible, using public wireless access points that have been setup for shared public purposes, such as internet cafes – these networks are generally not very secure. Use the cellular network instead of public Wi-Fi to do online banking.
Don’t email or text banking information
Never send sensitive account information such as account numbers, passwords, or any combination of information that can be used to steal your identity via text message or email.
Deactivate your phone with your mobile carrier if it’s stolen
If your mobile device is stolen, it can’t be used to access the Coast Mobile Banking without your member card number and your personal access code. You should contact your mobile carrier to have your mobile device deactivated.
Disable Mobile Banking if your phone if lost or stolen (for Text and Alerts)
If you’ve misplaced your mobile phone you can disable text banking and alerts by visiting the Coast Mobile Banking Administration page within Coast Online Banking. If you locate your mobile phone, just go online to enable the feature.
Delete your text messages and emails (for Text and Alerts)
We recommend you delete Coast Mobile Banking text messages and emails once you’re done with them.
Please note: If you haven't migrated to the new digital banking experience, some of the help in these pages may not apply to you. If you have questions about online banking, give us a call 1.888.517.7000. When it's time to upgrade to the new digital banking experience, you'll receive a notification when you log in to online banking on desktop, or you’ll get a prompt to download our new app. Please continue using the old app until you are prompted to switch – if you download it beforehand, you’ll receive an error message. Once you accept the notification or download the app, we'll guide you through the setup process step-by-step.Learn more.
