Refund Policy
Refund Policy
Any premium refund will be calculated by the carrier pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy and underwriting guidelines for the program. Once Lindbergh is notified by the insurance carrier of the refund amount, we will promptly process your refund. The refund will be processed in the same method initially used to purchase the policy; provided that if the initial transaction was processed via credit card and the refund date is in excess of 120 days from the initial transaction, such refund will be processed via check. If your refund is processed via check, please allow additional time for processing.
Any premium refund on a policy billed and collected directly by the insurance company will be calculated and returned by the carrier pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy and underwriting guidelines for the program.
