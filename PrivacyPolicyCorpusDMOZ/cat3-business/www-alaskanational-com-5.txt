Fast Facts
According to the NCCI, the average cost of a lost time claim is over $47,000.
On average lost time claims cost 37x more than medical only claims.
To replace an injured worker can cost you up to 30% of their annual compensation.
You can avoid these costs with a strong return to work program.
