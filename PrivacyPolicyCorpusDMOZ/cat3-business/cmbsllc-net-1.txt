Privacy Policy
In order to enhance usability, many sites ask your web browser to create a small text file containing a unique, anonymous bit of data, and store the file in a directory on your computer. These files are often referred to as cookies, and act as the “memory” needed to improve your experience while interacting with the web. They are the foundation of most shopping carts, remembering the items you have selected, and serve several other helpful and related purposes as well.
To provide our customers and website users with the most relevant and helpful information during their online browsing sessions, we employ the use of cookies to help make sure you aren’t bombarded with irrelevant advertisements. We strive to ensure that the ads you see while browsing the web are relevant to your needs, and that they serve a helpful purpose for you, as the consumer.
In most cases, our efforts to provide you with ads most suitable to your needs are built around tools provided by third parties (like Google). In an effort to make your entire internet browsing experience more consistent, some cookie information from third-party vendors may be deployed as you browse the internet within and beyond our website.
Though cookies are anonymous and improve your browsing experience, some people may want to opt out of this service or manage how Google’s use of cookies affects them directly. To do so you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or the Google Ads Preferences Manager, respectively. You can also completely disable tracking by Google Analytics through the use of Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.
