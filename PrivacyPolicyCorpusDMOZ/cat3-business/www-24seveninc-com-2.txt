Dream Job: Being Considered For One of Our Clients' Freelance or Full-Time
Positions.In order to be
considered for one of our clients' freelance or full-time positions, you must
be a member of the Sites and you must upload your resume to our database.After you submit your
resume to us, two things will happen: (1) your resume will be sent to the inbox
of a 24 Seven recruitment specialist who will review the resume and decide
whether to contact you personally, and (2) you will receive an auto response
stating that your resume will be kept in our database for six months from the
date it was uploaded and that during that time you may receive a call from one
of our recruitment specialists if he or she believes that you might be a good
fit for an available position.  Whether a
24 Seven recruitment specialist contacts you will depend on your years and type
of experience, salary requirements, education, and your resume's relevance to
open positions.  As the requirements for
each position differ on a case by case basis, no assurances can be given that
your qualifications will meet the necessities of any open position within 24
Seven’s needs. If a 24 Seven
recruitment specialist contacts you for an interview, and you are interested in
meeting with us, we will schedule an interview for you to come to meet us in
one of our conveniently located offices or, if a meeting in person is not
warranted, we will set up a preliminary phone interview.  A face to face
interview lasts approximately 30 minutes.
During that time, we ask you that you tell us about your prior work
experience, education, interests, salary information, and geographic location
and, if relevant, we will ask to see your portfolio.  We will also tell you about our open positions
that might fit your experience.  During
the face to face interview we may ask you to fill out an application and
provide us with details about your prior work experience and professional
references. We will make all
necessary introductions to prospective employers and we never charge you a fee
for our job search services.Disclaimer of
