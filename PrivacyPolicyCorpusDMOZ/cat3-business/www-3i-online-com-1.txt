link. For printed information on joint replacement, call 1-800-447-5633.
Talk to your surgeon about whether joint replacement or another
treatment is right for you and the risks of the procedure, including
the risk of implant wear, loosening or failure, and pain, swelling and
infection. Zimmer Biomet does not practice medicine; only a surgeon
can answer your questions regarding your individual symptoms,
diagnosis and treatment.
