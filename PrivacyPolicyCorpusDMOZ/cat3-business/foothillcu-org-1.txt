We understand the financial hardships many of our members are facing amid the coronavirus pandemic, so we created this program to help ease the financial burden:
Pandemic Relief Loan
Skip-a-pay for qualifying loans (fee waived)
Mortgage loan forbearance up to 90 days
Interest only payments for up to three months
Up to 60-day loan payment extensions (deferment)
Fees/penalties waived for Certificates, Club Accounts (like Summertime Savings),
Fee waived for loan payment made online or by phone from another financial institution
If you need financial assistance or just have questions, don't hesitate to give us a call at (626) 445-0950 option 1, to speak to one of our team members. We're here for you. We're here to listen. Together, we'll get through this.
Economic Impact Payment (Stimulus Check)
Economic Impact Payments, also called Stimulus Checks, intended to ease the financial stress of the coronavirus pandemic are officially on their way. Most Americans are in line for a one-time payment of up to $1,200, with married couples getting up to $2,400. Families will get an additional $500 per child.
Those with direct deposit information will receive their payment first, then a wave of mailed checks will follow. Check the IRS website for qualifications.
Stimulus check payments have started to appear in some of our member's accounts via direct deposit. Login to online/mobile banking to see if yours came in. If not, the IRS has a tool that checks the status of your impact payment. With their tool, you can find the following information:
Your payment status
Your payment type
If your information is up to date with the IRS
Please remember that Foothill does not control when you will receive your payment. View the IRS proposed mail schedule for the check.
For all information regarding the Economic Impact Payment, please visit the IRS website.
