All of the content on the Site, including without limitation, the graphics, design, photos, videos and look and feel are owned by TSP and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights protection. The TSP logos are trademarks owned by TSP and may not be used or reproduced without Our written permission. In addition, You may not reverse engineer, de-compile, or otherwise disassemble software included on the Site.
Ordering Products. After placing an order for a Product on the Site, You will receive an email from TSP confirming that We have received Your order ("Order Confirmation"). This does not mean that Your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to Us to buy a Product and any order placed through the Site is subject to acceptance by Us, and We will confirm Our acceptance by sending You an email confirming the shipment of Your order (the "Shipping Confirmation Email"). A contract with Us will only be formed when We send You the Shipping Confirmation Email. The contract will relate only to those Products whose shipment We have confirmed have shipped in the Shipping Confirmation Email. We reserve the right to cancel Your order at any time before We have accepted it and We may rescind Our acceptance and cancel Your order where there has been an obvious error in price or where the Product is no longer in Our or Our third party fulfillment provider's stock.
TSP does not sell, or ship, internationally. Prices and availability of Products on the Site are subject to change without notice. Our Site contains a large number of Products and it's possible that some of the Products listed on Our Site may be incorrectly priced, even though We do Our best to ensure accuracy. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on Our Site, We may, at Our discretion, contact You for instructions before shipping the Product or notify You that We have rejected Your order. We are under no obligation to provide the product to You at an incorrect lower price, even after We have sent You an Order Confirmation or a Shipping Confirmation Email. You acknowledge that Products may sell very fast and it may be the case the Product You ordered is no longer available. You agree that We may cancel Your order after You have received an Order Confirmation without penalty. It's even possible that You may receive a Shipping Confirmation Email, but the Product is no longer available in Our stock. You agree that We may rescind Our acceptance and cancel Your order without penalty if We are unable to ship the Product You ordered due to unavailability.
IN THE EVENT FULL PAYMENT IS NOT MADE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER INVOICING A FINANCE CHARGE WILL BE ADDED TO THE UNPAID BALANCE. IF A FINANCE CHARGE APPEARS ON THE STATEMENT, IT WAS COMPUTED BY A PERIODIC RATE OF 1.5% PER MONTH WHICH IS AN ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF 18% ADDED TO THE PREVIOUS BALANCE AFTER DEDUCTING CURRENT PAYMENTS , AND/OR CREDITS APPEARING ON THE STATEMENT.
Collection of Taxes. In states where We do not have a physical presence, We may not be required to collect and remit sales tax for Site purchases. However, many states require that their residents file a sales or use tax return for Products purchased on this Site. You should consult Your state and local tax laws to determine compliance with tax laws and regulations in Your jurisdiction. In some states, We do collect and remit sales tax. For purchases where sales tax is applicable You will see the tax calculated on the checkout page before You are asked to confirm the purchase. We use commercially reasonable efforts to compute and remit the correct amount of tax required on each taxable purchase, however, We do not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax shown as the tax owed. As a result of any error, We may over-collect or under-collect Your tax. In consideration of Our allowing You access to and use of the Site, and in collecting and remitting taxes required on Your purchases, You hereby waive Your right to claim that the tax collected on any purchase is incorrect in any respect and agree to hold harmless TSP, its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, for any harm or other damages You may incur as a result of Our error in calculating the taxes You owe for Your Product purchases.
Shipping. The term "shipping" or "ship" includes the commencement of shipping Products in an order for multiple purchases or where the Product purchased consists of components that must be shipped separately. Your order may consist of Products that require shipment in separate packages. In all such orders, We try to ship out individual packages together so that they arrive at the same time; however, in some instances, We commence shipping by shipping individual packages in the order the soonest they are available. In such case, Our notification to You that Your order has "shipped," indicates the time when shipping has commenced and does not mean that all Products in the order have shipped at that time. You agree that credit cards and debit cards are to be charged on the date of inventory reservation for the order, not the date of shipping. All items purchased from target-specialty.com are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to You upon tender of the item to the carrier.
Other Terms. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Gwinnett County and You hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. You acknowledge and agree that except as specified herein, no representations, warranties or promises of any kind have been made to You by TSP regarding the use of the Site, the TSP Content, the Products or the Services.
