Checks Unlimited will replace any Checks Unlimited manufactured product found to contain printing errors caused by Checks Unlimited or to be defective in workmanship or materials. While Checks Unlimited takes care in the manufacture of such products, it is commercially impossible to detect all errors and imperfections and, therefore, no other warranty is given.
