Kemin may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.
Kemin makes no representation that materials in the Kemin Web Sites are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where their content is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Kemin Web Sites from locations outside Iowa do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
You may not use or export the materials in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations. Any claim relating to the materials shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Iowa.
Severability and Integration
Unless otherwise specified herein, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Kemin and governs your use of the Web Sites, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Kemin. If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
No Waiver
The failure of Kemin to enforce any provisions of this Agreement or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of this Agreement or to act with respect to similar breaches.
No Professional Advice
Any information supplied by any employee or agent of Kemin, whether by telephone, e-mail, letter, facsimile, Internet transmission or other form of communication, is intended solely as general guidance on the use of the Kemin Web Sites, and does not constitute legal, tax, accounting, marketing or other professional advice. Individual situations and state laws vary and users are encouraged to obtain appropriate advice from qualified professionals in the applicable jurisdictions. Any statement of facts contained on the Kemin Web Sites or in market comments, which may be posted on the Kemin Web Sites, are derived from sources believed to be reliable, but are not guaranteed as to accuracy, nor do they purport to be complete. No responsibility is assumed with respect to any such statement, nor with respect to any expression of opinion herein contained.
Miscellaneous
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Kemin as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Kemin Web Sites. Nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of Kemin right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Kemin Web Sites or information provided to or gathered by Kemin with respect to such use.
A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Kemin may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting. You should visit this page from time to time to review the then-current Terms because they are binding on you. Certain provisions of these Terms may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages at web sites maintained by Kemin. If you use the Kemin Web sites after the terms have been revised, you agree to be bound to the Terms as amended.
If you have any questions or comments about this Agreement, you may contact Kemin at the address above or by sending an email to Libby.Nelson@Kemin.com.
Term and Termination
Kemin reserves the right a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright that is allegedly infringed, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Web Sites, with or without notice.
