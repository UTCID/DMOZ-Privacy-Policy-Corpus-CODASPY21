A description of each work claimed to have been infringed, including any relevant information about the infringing activity;
A description of the location on the Site (or, if the infringing information is located on another Site linked to through the Site, information about the location of the link or reference on the Site) where the alleged infringement is occurring, providing sufficient detail to allow SIGMA to locate the infringing material;
Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate and that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of that owner; and

SIGMA does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Site, and SIGMA will remove the infringing content if properly notified of infringement. As stated above, SIGMA reserves the right to remove any and all content and user submissions at any time without prior notice.
Counter-Notice: If you believe your submitted content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to SIGMA’s Designated Copyright Agent:

If you do send Ideas to SIGMA, you expressly agree that your submission is non-confidential and does not create an obligation or duty on the part of SIGMA in any way. Your submission is being delivered voluntarily and without restriction and we conclude that SIGMA is free to use the information and Ideas provided. SIGMA does not accept any legal obligation (whether of confidentiality, compensation, return or otherwise) with respect to any Ideas to us unless we agree to such obligations in a signed document.
