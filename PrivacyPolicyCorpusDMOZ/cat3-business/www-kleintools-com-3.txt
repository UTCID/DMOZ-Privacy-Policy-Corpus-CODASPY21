APPLICABLE LAW; ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH KLEIN TOOLS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
You accept and agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or your use of the Site, including products and services order or purchased through the Site, except that the parties agree that neither you or Klein Tools are required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of a party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
The parties agree to notify the other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Klein Tools shall be sent to Klein Tools, Inc., 450 Bond Street, PO Box 1418, Lincolnshire, IL 60069-1418, ATTN: LEGAL. The parties agree: (a) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (b) that any arbitration will occur in Chicago, Illinois; (c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (d) that the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by these Terms of Use and the laws of the State of Illinois and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. YOU AND KLEIN TOOLS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Klein Tools agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
/p>
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois.
TERMINATION
Klein Tools may terminate these Terms of Use and your access to the Site, or any portion of thereof, without notice and in our sole discretion. We further reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site or any features or portions thereof without prior notice. You agree that Klein Tools will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof. You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by no longer accessing the Site and destroying all Content and any other materials obtained by or through the Site. Disclaimers, ownership, limitation of liability, indemnification and any other provision which are intended to survive will survive termination hereof.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between Klein Tools and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof. In its sole discretion, Klein Tools may modify these Terms of Use by posting the revised version on this Site. If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Enforcement of these Terms of Use is solely in our discretion, and the absence of enforcement of these Terms of Use, or part thereof, does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce these Terms of Use.
