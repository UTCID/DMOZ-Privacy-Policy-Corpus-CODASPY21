Loading ...HomeAbout PILegal InformationPrivacy PolicyWe are very pleased that you are interested in our company. Data protection is of particular importance. As a matter of principle, the use of the Internet pages is possible without the disclosure of any personal data. However, if a data subject wishes to make use of special services of our company via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data. If processing personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally obtain the consent of the data subject.
Processing of personal data, such as the name, address, email address or telephone number of a data subject, is always carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to our company.

4. Cookies
Our web pages use cookies. Cookies are text files which are stored on a computer system by an Internet browser.Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters that assign Internet pages and servers to the specific Internet browser where the cookie was stored. This allows the the Internet pages and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified by its unique cookie ID.The use of cookies allows us to provide users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without cookies.Cookies help us to optimize the information and offers on our website for the user. As already mentioned, cookies allow us to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter his access data each time he visits the website because this is taken over by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the shopping basket cookie in the online shop. The online shop uses the cookie to remember the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping basket.The data subject can prevent cookies being set by our website at any time by setting the Internet browser used and therefore permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This possible with all common Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates setting of cookies in the Internet browser, not all functions on our Internet site may be used to the full.
5. Collection of General Data and Information
Our website collects general data and information each time a person or an automated system visits our website. This general data and information is stored in so-called log files on the server. We may record the types and versions of browsers used, the operating system used by the accessing system, the website from that a system accesses our website (so-called referrer), the subwebsites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website, the date and time of access to the website, an Internet protocol address (IP address), the Internet service provider of the accessing system and other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.We do not draw any conclusions on the data subject when using this general data and information. Instead, this information is required to deliver the contents of our website correctly, to optimize the contents of our website as well as the advertising, to ensure the permanent functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website and to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in the event of a cyber-attack. Therefore, this anonymously collected data and information is evaluated by us statistically and also with the objective of increasing data protection and data security in our company and ultimately to ensure an optimum level of protection for the personal data processed by us. The anonymous data in the server log files is stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

9. Data Protection for Applications and During the Application Process
The entity responsible for processing collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application. Processing can also be done electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant sends corresponding application documents to the entity responsible for processing electronically, for example, by email or via a form on the website. If the entity responsible for processing concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the data transmitted will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the entity responsible for processing does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents shall be deleted automatically three months after notification of the decision of refusal, provided that no other legitimate interests of the entity responsible for processing contradict deletion. Other legitimate interest in this sense is, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Opportunity Act (German Allgemeinen Gleichbehandlungsgesetz - AGG).
10. Legal Basis for Processing
Art. 6 I letter a GDPR serves as a legal basis for processing where we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If processing of personal data is necessary for fulfilling a contract where the the data subject is a contracting party, as is the case for example, when processing is necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or return services, processing is based on Art. 6 I letter b GDPR. The same applies to necessary for precontractual purposes, for example, for enquiries on our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation that requires processing of personal data, for example to fulfil tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I letter c GDPR. In rare cases, it may be necessary to process personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or any other natural person. This would be the case for example, when a visitor were injured on our company premises and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, a hospital or other third parties. Processing would then be based on Art. 6 I letter d GDPR. Ultimately, processing could be based on Art. 6 I letter f GDPR. Processing not covered by any of the aforementioned legal provisions are based on this legal framework if processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided the interests, fundamental rights and freedom of the data subject do not prevail. Such processing is permitted in particular when it has been mentioned specifically by the European legislator. In this respect, the European legislator took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person affected is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47, second sentence, GDPR).
11. Justified Interests in Processing Pursued by Entity Responsible or a Third Party
If processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I letter f GDPR, it is in our legitimate interest to conduct our business for the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.
12. Duration, for which Personal Data is Stored
Personal data is stored only as long as needed for the purpose of processing your enquiry. If no further statutory obligation for storing personal data is necessary, it will be deleted after processing.
13. Legal or Contractual Regulations for the Provision of Personal Data; Necessity for Conclusion of the Contract; Obligation of the Data Subject to Provide Personal Data; Possible Consequences of Failure to Provide
We inform you that provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or may also result from contractual regulations (e.g., information on the contractual partner). In some cases, it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded if a data subject provides us with personal data that we must subsequently process. For example, the person affected is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company enters into a contract with him/her. Failure to provide personal data would mean that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact our data protection officer. Our data protection officer will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether provision of personal data is required by law or contract or required for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and what consequences failure to provide the personal data would have.
