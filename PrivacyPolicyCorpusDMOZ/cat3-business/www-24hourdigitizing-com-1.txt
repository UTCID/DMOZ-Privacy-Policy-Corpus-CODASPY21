We use your email and mailing address to inform you of site improvements, feature announcements, newsletters, 24HourDigitizing.com promotional offers.

Does 24HourDigitizing.com use "IP Addresses" and cookies?
24HourDigitizing.com uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows:
IP Addresses: An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. We do not intentionally link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.
24HourDigitizing.com Cookies: Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. 24HourDigitizing.com cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information. Currently, 24HourDigitizing.com intends to make only limited use of cookies for the purpose of delivering content and ads specific to your interests. For instance cookies may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping cart" or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in.
What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your
information from loss, misuse, or alteration?
Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. You may edit your 24HourDigitizing.com account information by using your 24HourDigitizing.com member name and password.
If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or a shared computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly recommend that you sign out of your 24HourDigitizing.com account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from the computer.
24HourDigitizing.com employs SSL - a specialized encryption and security technology -- to protect your Customer Information. We understand that this is especially important when there is an exchange of credit card, billing and password information. In addition, we limit access of Customer Information to only those employees who need it to carry out their jobs.
24HourDigitizing.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
You will only be asked for your member name and password when you initiate the contact and only if the member name and password are necessary to correct a service problem.
How can you update or correct Customer Information?
Customer Information that you provide during registration is available in your 24HourDigitizing.com online account. To edit your Customer Information, you must enter your login and password to access your account. You may edit your account information at any time.
You can also cancel your 24HourDigitizing.com membership by contacting 24HourDigitizing.com. If you request cancellation of your account, 24HourDigitizing.com may (but is not required to) remove any and all content or other personal information from the 24HourDigitizing.com site, and your orders may not be accessible to you even if you choose to rejoin or reactivate your account at a later date. Information necessary for the purposes of maintaining business records regarding a cancelled account, including records of credit transactions and account ownership, will be retained in accordance with applicable law.
Notification of Change: If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
