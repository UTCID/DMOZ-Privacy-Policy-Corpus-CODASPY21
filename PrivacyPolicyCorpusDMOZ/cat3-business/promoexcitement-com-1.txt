Personal Information
We maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases you make online to ensure proper delivery of the information you’ve requested. Under certain circumstances, we may share your information and browsing history with third parties that provide services on our behalf. We may combine all of this information with information about you that we acquire from our joint marketing partners, from unrelated third parties, and from our other brands. On occasion, we may offer you carefully screened products or services from our sister divisions which we believe will help you and your company increase performance, but you will always be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these notifications, quickly and easily.
Our websites use “cookies,” which are small data files that are stored on your computer when you visit a website, to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. Cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages are useful to you and which pages are not. For example, we may use cookies to remember the items in your shopping cart and monitor and maintain information about your use of our websites. We may also use our own cookies to help determine which of our ads are shown to you on other websites. To opt out of this targeted online advertising that utilizes our cookies, please set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.
We also use “pixel tags” which are tiny graphic images, on our websites and in our emails, to help us analyze our customers’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our websites. We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from and about you to improve our websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor our communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, and for other internal business purposes. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these policies, please contact us at service@promoexcitement.com. Pixel tags may collect information about the pages you view, your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type and other technical information about your computer.
Furthermore, we work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other Internet advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our sites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/.
Protection and Storage of Information
We store your information on our computers and protect it using security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration. We use firewalls, SSL and information access authorization controls to safeguard your information. We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed or resolve disputes.
