GDPR & Privacy Notice
Information Collection, Use, Management and Sharing of your Personnal Data by PopsiCube Group
What do we need ?
The PopsiCube Group will be known as the ‘Controller’ of your personal data regarding business partnership (limited to your professional contact details and your position within your Company), required as part of our commercial activity. According to the GDPR the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be considered as carried out for a legitimate interest, and so is considered as lawful.
Why do we need it ?
We are the sole owner of the information collected on this website. We only have access to and collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than needed to fulfil your request, e.g. to be part of an investigative site for a potential clinical study.
We need to know this basic personal data in order to be able to respond you regarding the reason you contacted us, and to contact you as part of our commercial activity and market research that may interest you regarding your job position inside your Company. We will not collect any personal data from you we do not need for this purpose.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about potential services, collaborations, or changes to this privacy notice.
What do we do with it ?
All the personal data we process is processed internally by our staff in France. Therefore, for the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance this information is located on secured external servers located in France.
Your data will not be transferred to any recipient in a third country or international organisation. No third parties have access to your personal data unless the law allows them to do so.
We have procedure and policy regarding Information Security and Data Protection in place to oversee the effective and secure processing of your personal data. Your data will not be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling.
How is your information protected ?
We take precautions to protect your information. Wherever we collect sensitive information, it is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, recruitment’s site) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
How long do we keep it
Your information that may be used for marketing and prospection purposes will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive this information, and at the latest, at the end of the activity of the company.
What are your rights?
In line with the GDPR, you can exercise your right regarding your personal data at any time via phone, email or our postal address: the right to access to, to ask for rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and to object to processing, as well as the right to data portability.
If you wish to raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal data, you can contact our Data Protection Officer using the following address dpo@popsicube.com who will investigate the matter.
If you are not satisfied with our response or if you believe we are processing your personal data not in accordance with the law you can complain to the CNIL (French Supervisory Authority).
