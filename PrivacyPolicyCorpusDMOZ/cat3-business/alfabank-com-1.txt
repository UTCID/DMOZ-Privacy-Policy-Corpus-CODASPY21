Use of information and data protection
Alfa Banking Group is committed to the online privacy of all its users. The Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (“the Directive”), which has been implemented by most countries in the European Union, safeguards the privacy of an individual’s personal details. Alfa Banking Group has adopted its principles as the basis for its worldwide data protection policy. We collect, record and use your personal information (name, company name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number) only with your consent and authorisation. Typically, this will be when you make enquiries or register for information or services.
We may share non-personal aggregate statistics (group) data about our site visitors’ traffic patterns with partners or other parties. However, we do not sell or share any information about individual users.
Your rights
In addition to the company’s safeguards, your personal data is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act. This provides amongst other things that the data we hold about you should be processed lawfully and fairly. It should be accurate, relevant and not excessive. The information should be kept up to date, where necessary, and not retained for longer than is necessary. It should be kept securely to prevent unauthorised access by other people. You have the right to see what is held about you and correct any inaccuracies.
Transfer of data
Personal data will only be transferred between Alfa Banking Group locations and third-party locations if adequate protection (being that which meets the requirements of the Directive) of personal data can be reasonably assumed at the locations concerned. Where we are required to do so, we will implement appropriate contracts to ensure the privacy of your personal details.
Security
We will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in our possession from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should be aware, however, that communications over the Internet (which includes e-mails to Alfa Banking Group and registering as a user on our website(s)) are not secure unless they have been encrypted and we do not accept any responsibility for any errors or omissions which arise from circumstances outside of our reasonable control.
Our website may contain links to other websites that are operated by third parties. Other websites may also reference or link to our website. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other websites.
Policy changes
Alfa Banking Group reserves the right to amend or modify this policy at any time, whether or not in response to changes in applicable data protection and privacy laws.
Enquiries
Any questions or concerns which you may have about this policy should be emailed to us. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any concerns or complaints regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this policy.
