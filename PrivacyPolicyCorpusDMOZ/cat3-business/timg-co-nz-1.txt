TIMG for LegalIntelligent information management for the legal sectorTIMG enables New Zealand legal organisations of all sizes to create streamlined and secure information management practicesHOW WE CAN HELP YOU
Why you need to care about information managementLegal organisations are legally required to comply with information management governance practices. You should ensure you have clear policies surrounding the following:Collection of informationDisclosure of informationDealing with requests for informationStorage, security, retention and disposal of informationARE YOU COMPLIANT?
How TIMG can transform information management practices for the legal sector
Enhance inefficient paper-based processesAlmost any paper based business process can be made more efficient with the application of workflow software. By automating business processes and decision making, your business will gain greater control, visibility and consistency within your processes. We understand that every agency is different and faces their own unique challenges regardless of size and complexity and that’s why our PaperLite platform allows us to customise automated workflows specific to your business requirements.
Capture and manage diverse inbound dataConvert business files and records to digital images and associated metadata. These services prove most effective for businesses who need to quickly access information from stored documents and who want to reduce the time it takes for staff to manually search and retrieve files and documents. As well as our imaging services for digitising files, TIMG also offers enhanced data extraction services, for complex indexing requirements which commonly assist in removing in-house data entry (such as new client contracts, application forms, or invoices).
Improve discovery and access to recordseDiscovery applications and technology enable businesses to pull information and records from the massive volumes of content that span the enterprise. Convert and store Electronically Stored Information (ESI) in the form of electronic documents, e-mail, voicemail, instant and text messages, databases, digital images, multimedia files and file metadata. TIMG also provides services that digitise hardcopy documents. We can collect and process a range of hardcopy documents so that they can be accessed, managed and reviewed in digital format.
Securely store and archive your informationAlmost every business stores information digitally and if something unexpected happens, the backed up data is essential to ensure business continuity. TIMG offers traditional vault based storage as well as cloud hosted solutions and disaster recovery for managing your back-ups. TIMG’s records management service also provides secure and reliable physical document storage for organisations of all sizes.
Securely destroy unwanted informationEnsure compliance and the security of your data. TIMG provides a range of services for document destruction, from onsite secure bins through to bulk destruction of documents and records. TIMG’s e-Waste service provides you with peace of mind that sensitive data residing on decommissioned computer or storage equipment is not able to be accessed by the wrong people.
Meet security, privacy and compliance standardsYou're in safe hands with TIMG. We manage sensitive records for several Government and corporate clients, who by default, demand the highest level of information security and process auditability/transparency of both physical and digital information. We understand that security and privacy are paramount when it comes to your sensitive data and that's why we have strict processes and procedures in place to protect your business information.
