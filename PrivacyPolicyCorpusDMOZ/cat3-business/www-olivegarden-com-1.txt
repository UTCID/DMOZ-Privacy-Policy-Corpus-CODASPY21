These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to the Company sites on which we have posted these Terms, including online, in-restaurant, mobile, or social locations (collectively, the "Sites"). The Sites are operated by Darden Corporation or our affiliates (collectively, "Darden or Company"). Throughout the Sites, the terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to Company. Company offers the Sites, including all information, tools and services available from the Sites, to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all the terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here. Your use of a Site constitutes your agreement to these Terms.
PLEASE READ
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT.
Accuracy, Completeness and Timeliness of Information on the Sites: Company is not responsible if information made available on the Sites is not accurate, complete or current. The material on the Sites is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon or used as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting primary, more accurate, more complete or more timely sources of information. Any reliance on the material on the Sites is at your own risk. The Sites may contain certain historical information. Historical information necessarily is not current and is provided for your reference only. We reserve the right to modify the contents of the Sites at any time, but we have no obligation to update any information on the Sites. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor changes to the Sites.
Communications: Company communications will be conducted through various channels, including but not limited to, in-restaurant devices, the Sites, email and SMS/text. If you provide Company with your mobile telephone number for promotional purposes you agree that Company may send to your mobile telephone number autodialed SMS (text) messages regarding offers. Recurring messaging and frequency may vary. Message and data rates may apply. Consent is not a condition of any purchase. For help, text "HELP" to any text message you receive or contact 1-888-443-5176 for customer support. To quit, text "STOP" to any text message you receive. If you reply "STOP" Company may send you an additional message confirming your "STOP" request. Text messages may not be available on all mobile carriers. See Privacy Notice for privacy related questions. If you sign-up for additional mobile programs in connection with Company you may receive additional messages in connection with such program.
Materials You Submit: You acknowledge that you are responsible for any material you may submit via the Sites (including any components of the Sites administered by third parties, such as tools that allow you to interact with the Sites or through other social media platforms), including the legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality and copyright of any such material. You may not upload to, distribute or otherwise publish through the Sites any content that (i) is confidential, proprietary, false, fraudulent, libelous, defamatory, obscene, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, infringing on intellectual property rights, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable; (ii) may constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party or otherwise give rise to liability or violate any law; or (iii) may contain software viruses, political campaigning, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam." You may not use a false e-mail address or other identifying information, impersonate any person or entity or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any content. You may not upload commercial content onto the Sites.
If you do submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Company an unrestricted, nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute and display such material throughout the world in any media. You further agree that Company is free to use any ideas, concepts or know-how that you or individuals acting on your behalf provide to Company.

You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all the rights to the content you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate any provision herein and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Company for all claims resulting from content you supply.

You may not use frames or utilize framing techniques or technology to enclose any content included on the Sites without Company's express written consent. Further, you may not utilize any Site content in any meta tags or any other "hidden text" techniques or technologies without Company's express written consent.

We have not necessarily reviewed all the information on those other sites and are not responsible for the content of those or any other sites or any products or services that may be offered through those or any other sites.

YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIALS. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM COMPANY OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF THE MATERIALS ON THE SITES IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, USEFULNESS, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, THE LAW MAY NOT PERMIT THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU SEND OR RECEIVE DURING YOUR USE OF THE SITES MAY NOT BE SECURE AND MAY BE INTERCEPTED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES.

THIS DISCLAIMER APPLIES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY ARISING FROM ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECTS, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUSES, FILE CORRUPTION, COMMUNICATION-LINE FAILURE, NETWORK OR SYSTEM OUTAGE, YOUR LOSS OF PROFITS, OR THEFT, DESTRUCTION, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, LOSS OR USE OF ANY RECORD OR DATA, AND ANY OTHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE LOSS.

INDEMNIFICATION

contractors, agents, licensors, service providers, subcontractors and suppliers from and against any and
all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court
costs, arising or resulting from your use of the Sites and any violation of these Terms of Use. If you
cause a technical disruption of the Sites or the systems transmitting the Sites to you or others, you
agree to be responsible for any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising or resulting from that disruption. Darden reserves
the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject
to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with Darden in the defense of such
matter.
JURISDICTION AND
APPLICABLE LAW
The laws of the State of Florida govern these Terms of Use and your use of the Sites, and you
irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of Orange for any action
arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use. We recognize that it is possible for you to obtain
access to the Sites from any jurisdiction in the world, but we have no practical ability to prevent such
access. The Sites have been designed to comply with the laws of the State of Florida and of the United
States. If any material on the Sites, or your use of the Sites, is contrary to the laws of the place
where you are when you access it, the Sites are not intended for you, and we ask you not to use the
Sites. You are responsible for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with
them.
Disputes
You agree that by entering into these Terms, you and Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury
and the ability to participate in a class action.
Any and all disputes Company or you has relating in any way to your relationship with the Company
(including without limitation with respect to your transactions with the Company, Company's
advertisements and disclosures, email and mobile SMS (text) messages Company sends to you, or the use or
disclosure of any information about you), these Terms, privacy notices, or terms of use, will be
submitted to confidential arbitration in the federal judicial district in which you reside, except to
the extent that you have, in any way, violated or threatened to violate any Company intellectual
property right. Program claims include claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort),
fraud, agency, your or the Company's negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other source
of law.
If you intend to seek arbitration must first send to the Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of
Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Company should be mailed to:
Attention: Legal
1000 Darden Center Drive
Orlando FL 32837
The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought.
If you and we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
received, you or we may commence arbitration.
All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration rules of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award is binding and may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration brought under,
or with respect to, claims is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these
Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless Company and You agree
otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.
For arbitration claims you assert against Company in accordance with this section (but not for any
arbitration claim against you) Company will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator's
fees and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or
witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a
lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside.
Unless unlawful, Company will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyers', experts', and witness fees,
expenses, and costs with respect to all claims. The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in
favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
warranted by that party's individual claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming
it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award
itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement
of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.
To the extent permitted by law, you will not agree to act as a representative or a private attorney
general, or in any other representative capacity, or participate as a member of a class of claimants in
any lawsuit against company in any court, or in arbitration, with respect to any program claims. This
section (confidential arbitration) will survive the termination of the relationship between you and
Company.
Company or you may seek injunctive relief only in any state or federal court in Orange County, Florida,
USA, and Company and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts
in Orange County, Florida USA for injunctive relief purposes. The arbitrator shall have no authority to
issue injunctive relief.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, under no circumstances is company liable for
any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages.
CHANGES TO THESE
TERMS OF USE
Darden reserves the right in its sole discretion to change, modify, add or remove any portion of these
Terms, in whole or in part, at any time, by posting revised terms on the relevant Sites. There is no
duty on Darden to send you additional methods of notice of changes. It is your responsibility to check
periodically for any changes we make to the Terms. Your continued use of the Sites after that point
signifies that you accept the changes.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT
AND ADMISSIBILITY
This agreement and any policies or operating rules posted on the Sites constitute the entire agreement
and understanding between you and Darden with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all
prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with
respect to such subject matter. A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial
or administrative proceedings based on or relating to use of the Sites to the same extent and subject to
the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
printed form.
SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the
agreement will remain in place.
