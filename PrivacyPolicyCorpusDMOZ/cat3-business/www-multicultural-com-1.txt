If you provide your telephone number in connection with providing a listing in the Multicultural Experts Directory or the print Source Book of Multicultural Experts, we will use it to call you when it is time to renew your listing. We also may call you to ask if you want to purchase any other products or services that MMR offers.

provide or to a recruiter who calls us asking for qualified candidates. (If you do not wish us to provide your number for these purposes, please let us know and we will not do so.) If you provide it for any other purpose, we may use it to call you to recommend that you list yourself or your company in the Directory or the Source Book.
If you provide your snail mail address when you order the print Source Book of Multicultural Marketing Experts, we will use it to send you the print volume you ordered. We also may use it to send you informational and promotional mailings from MMR and other companies.
When you provide your credit card number and related information to pay for a listing in the Directory or the Source Book, or buy a book from our store, your credit number is provided to our credit-card processor, to use solely to process your order.
If we sell, assign, or otherwise transfer the business of this Web site to which your personal information relates, we will transfer your personal information to the buyer and use reasonable commercial efforts to require the buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
