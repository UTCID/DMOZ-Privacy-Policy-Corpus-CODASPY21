Outdoor Privacy Screens
Are you looking for some privacy in your outdoor living area or by the pool? Consider one of our fiberglass privacy screens as a beautiful addition to your area. A slatted screen gives you privacy but also allows wind to move through in the event of bad weather or high winds. Privacy screens are available in a single panel or corner style with Napa tails and 10"x8' Square PermaLite® columns.
