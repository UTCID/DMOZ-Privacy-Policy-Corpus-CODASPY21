Secure Transactions
Customer satisfaction is our number one priority. To this end, site security is paramount. When you do business with Texas America Safety Company you can be sure it is safe! As a leader in Internet commerce, we make sure our customers feel secure.
All of our sites use a Secure Server. If you use a secure browser such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer, your credit card information will be encrypted. When you proceed to the order information page you will see a lock or key at the bottom of your screen. This indicates that specific page is secure. If you do not use a secure browser, you will not be able to proceed to the order information page and, therefore, cannot order on our web sites.
If you are prevented from ordering online, you may contact us at sales@tasco- safety.com to place an order. DO NOT email us your credit card number. While our web site is secure, email is not secure.
Our Commitment To Privacy:
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect: This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Texas America Safety Company website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
Name
Address
Email address
Phone number
Credit/Debit Card Information
(etc.)
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:
Name
Address
Phone number
(etc.)
How We Use This Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer any questions that might arise; as well as, to send shipping confirmations. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security: To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Our shopping cart is tested daily for vulnerabilities through MacAfee Hacker Safe. In addition, our websites and physical location have been certified by Trustwave.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy: Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
