Dei Fratelli Privacy Policy
Dei Fratelli Privacy Policy
Dei Fratelli (Hirzel Canning Company) understands that many visitors to our website are concerned about how their personal information they provide online is used and maintained by Dei Fratelli. This privacy policy has been created to address these concerns and to demonstrate how we gather, and provide, information. Our privacy policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back occasionally.
Gathering and Use Of Information
DeiFratelli.com may collect personally identifiable information from visitors on a voluntary basis when you subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form, or enter information on our site. Personal information may include your name, postal address, e-mail address, and/or telephone numbers, etc. We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer any personal information we gather on our website to any third parties without your prior consent. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Personal information is collected for the following reasons: 1) to e-mail consumers via our On The Vine eNewsletter, 2) to notify winners of contests and to distribute prizes, 3) to distribute items that are part of “giveaways” that you have registered for, 4) for use in our online and off-line marketing and advertising campaigns. 5) To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.
COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
Contests/Sweepstakes
We occasionally run contests on our website for which we ask participants to provide contact information. This information is used to contact the participant only when necessary in accordance with the rules of the contest or sweepstakes.
