Privacy Policy
We take the privacy of our customers seriously. This privacy policy governs the data-handling for Earth Sun Moon Trading Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alumni Originals and Ink Pixi, and applies to all web sites: www.earthsunmoon.com, www.aotees.com, www.inkpixi.com.
Our offices are located at 111 North Center Street in Grove City, PA 16127 USA, and you can reach us at (724) 458-1687 extension 315 with questions or concerns about your personal information.
OUR POLICY
Our web sites do not collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. So, if you just want to browse and learn about our unique shirts and hats, we invite you to do so. As a casual, unregistered visitor to our site, we'll recognize your home server (e.g., that your web access is through AOL.com), but not your e-mail address or any other personal or system information. Of course, since we must ship our shirts and hats to you, if you want to order our products it will be necessary for you to provide personally-identifiable information. This will include your name, address, phone number and credit card information. Any information you provide is downloaded off of the web server to a secure system and is maintained there. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children and will, if requested to do so by a parent or guardian, suppress a child's personal data in our database.
We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction, and accidental loss. All our employees and data processors who have access to, and are associated with the confidentiality of our visitors' personal data, have undergone background checks, and are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our visitors' personal data.
OUR CUSTOMER LIST
When you buy our products, we add your information to our Customer List. We may use this list to follow up with you about an order, and may from time to time send you mail to let you know about new products or services we think you would like. This information may also be shared with other marketers to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these companies or from us, please advise us by using the mail address, e-mail, or phone number provided above. Please include your name and address, and we will place you on our Do Not Mail list.
E-MAIL INFORMATION
If you purchase from us online, you will be required to supply us with your e-mail address. This is not optional, because we use this to provide you with an order confirmation and then with a shipping confirmation. You may, however, also choose to receive periodic e-mails from us; we may inform you of new products or web-only promotions. If you do provide us with your e-mail address you can rest assured that we do not provide your e-mail address to anyone else.
ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA
Our customers have voluntarily provided all the information that we have on file, while placing their orders. This includes name, address, phone number and e-mail address if provided. All credit card information is encrypted for security purposes.
If you have concerns about the content of the personal information we have on file for you, please call us at (724) 458-1687 extension 315. We will confirm the information that you provided to ensure our records are accurate. We reserve the right to refuse to confirm personal data, but will give a reason for our refusal.
