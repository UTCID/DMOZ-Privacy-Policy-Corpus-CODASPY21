Terms and Conditions
THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON WHICH HDD BROKER LLC OFFERS

Welcome to the user agreement (the "Agreement" or "User Agreement")

Listing and Selling
Definition:
"Your Equipment Information" is defined as any
information you provide to us about your equipment, via
phone, fax, online, applications, or through any email feature.
There is no contractual obligation to HDD Broker when
you List your equipment. Only when we have a buyer interested
in your equipment do we require a signed sales contract
before proceeding. That means you are not financially obliged
to HDD Broker unless we sell your equipment. If you
sell your equipment yourself, please inform HDD Broker
so that we may remove your listing(s).
Listings will not display seller names or addresses. All
transactions and offers will be conducted through
HDD Broker or one of its designated agents.
HDD Broker determines the published List Price based
upon your asking price.
Pricing may also be determined by
other factors such as market conditions, currencies and our
commission structure.
You must be legally able to sell the item(s) you list for
sale on the Site. You must describe your item and all terms of
sale on the listing page of the Site. Your listings may only
include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other
content relevant to the sale of that item. All listed items
must be listed in an appropriate category and are subject to
revision at our discretion.
HDD Broker reserves the right to refuse listings
submissions for any reason.
Stock Photos: HDD Broker strives to authentically represent equipment on
our site. For that reason, we do not accept "stock" or promotional
photos from manufactures websites. However, if a manufacturer has listed
new equipment on our site we will accept their "stock" picture as a fair
depiction of their product.

and its affiliated companies

however, only will be used in accordance with our
