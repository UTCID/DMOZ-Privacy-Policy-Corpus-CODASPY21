UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL VCINITY OR ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, OR THIRD PARTY PARTNERS, LICENSORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, EXTRAORDINARY, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE, OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE) WHICH ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THE SITES, INCLUDING YOUR USE THEREOF, OR ANY OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH VCINITY, EVEN IF VCINITY OR A VCINITY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (B) ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES (US$100.00) DOLLARS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) HOWEVER ARISING, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND EVEN IF VCINITY KNOWS THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH CASE VCINITY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
Arbitration.
This “Arbitration” section is referred to herein as the “Arbitration Agreement.”  The parties agree that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes between you and VCINITY arising out of, relating to, or resulting from these Terms, shall be subject to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement, and not any court action (other than a small claims court action to the extent the claim qualifies).  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
Class Action Waiver.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
Procedures.  Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would, including, without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in these Terms.  You may visit http://www.adr.org for information on the AAA and https://apps.adr.org/webfile for information on how to file a claim against VCINITY.
Venue.  The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.  If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or VCINITY may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on each party, but subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant.  Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
Governing Law.  The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.  The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users of the Sites, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by applicable law.
Costs of Arbitration.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees“) will be governed by the AAA’s Rules.  Each party will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including, without limitation, all attorney fees.
Confidentiality.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
Severability.  If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement, other than the Class Action Waiver, is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court decides that any of the provisions of the Class Action Waiver are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.  The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
Local Laws; Export Control.
VCINITY controls and operates the Sites from the United States of America and the Materials may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.  If you use the Sites outside the United States of America, you are responsible for following applicable local laws.  You agree to comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce and any other United States or foreign agencies and authorities in connection with your use of the Sites and you agree that you shall not transfer, or authorize the transfer, of any content to a prohibited country or otherwise in violation of any applicable laws.  In particular, but without limitation, the content may not be exported or re-exported, in violation of any applicable laws, (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders.  By using any content subject to any such restrictions and regulations, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.
Feedback.
If you provide any communications, comments, questions, suggestions, or related materials to VCINITY, whether orally, in writing or otherwise (collectively, “Feedback”) with respect to the Sites or Materials, including, without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, all such Feedback is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary.  You hereby assign all right, title, and interest in, and VCINITY is free to use and otherwise exploit, without any attribution or compensation to you, such Feedback, including all intellectual and other proprietary rights therein, for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and selling, directly or indirectly, products and services using such Feedback.  You understand and agree that VCINITY is not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such Feedback, and you have no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.  If an assignment of all right, title, and interest in any Feedback is barred by applicable law, you nevertheless hereby grant to VCINITY an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, unrestricted license to use, distribute, make, exploit, practice, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise exploit, and authorize others to do so, all such Feedback in any manner whatsoever, in any medium now known or later developed, without compensation, attribution, or any obligation to you or to any other person or entity.
General.
If the use of the Sites by you or anyone using your account, in VCINITY sole discretion, violates these Terms or any other VCINITY agreement or policy, is objectionable or unlawful, or interferes with, disrupts, or degrades the functioning or use of the Internet, the Sites, or our computer systems in any manner that in our sole discretion could damage, disable, overburden, impair, or interfere with any other party’s use of any of the Sites then, without limiting any other right or remedy, VCINITY may suspend, deny, or restrict your access to the Sites (and to take any other action VCINITY deems appropriate to protect VCINITY, our users, and other customers).  You agree not to re-join or attempt to use the Sites if VCINITY has banned or suspended you.  Any illegal activities undertaken in connection with the Sites may be referred to the authorities.  Without limiting the general policy stated above, you agree not to use the Sites (including by linking to the Sites) in any manner that:
is unlawful, harmful to minors, threatening, harassing, abusive, defamatory, slanderous, fraudulent, gratuitously violent, obscene, deceptive, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise offensive, hateful or abusive;
infringes or misappropriates VCINITY’s or a third party’s intellectual property, confidentiality, or other rights;
advocates or solicits violence, criminal conduct or the violation of law or the rights of any third party;
distributes advertising or promotional content;
compiles, uses, downloads, or otherwise copies any user information and/or usage information (whether or not such information constitutes personally identifiable information), or that impermissibly transmits, provides, or otherwise distributes such information to any third party;
provides material support or resources (or conceals or disguises the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources) to any organization(s) designated by the United States Government as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;
decompiles, disassembles, uses reverse engineering, or otherwise attempts to derive the source code for the computer systems and other technology that operate the Sites or that is available through the Site;
accesses (or attempts to access) any of the Sites’ content by any means other than through the interface that is provided by VCINITY.  You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Sites’ content through any automated script or routine, including “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” bots, web crawlers, or other means, that accesses the Sites’ content in a manner that sends more request messages to servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional online web browser;
interferes with or disrupts the Sites’ content (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Sites’ content), whether via malicious software or otherwise; and/or
reproduces, duplicates, redisplays, frames, makes copies of, or resells the Sites’ content for any purpose.
Subject to the Arbitration Agreement, California state law, and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.  Foreign laws do not apply.  You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Sites that is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement shall be filed only in the courts located in Santa Clara County in the State of California.  If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties and no other terms will be modified.  VCINITY’s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term.  These Terms are the entire agreement between you and VCINITY and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements between you and VCINITY about this Site.  If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by VCINITY without restriction.
