Influencer Marketing
More marketers are increasing their influencer budgets, and reporting that the quality of customers and traffic from influencer marketing is better than other sources. Yet influencer marketing continues to operate within a complex, rapidly-evolving ecosystem with rising levels of fraud, changing social media algorithms, and complex attribution and measurement. That’s where the ANA comes in as your trusted resource to help capitalize on its ROI while navigating its hurdles.
