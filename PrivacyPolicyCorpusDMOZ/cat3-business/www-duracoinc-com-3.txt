The obligation to arbitrate shall extend to any affiliate, subsidiary, officer, employee, shareholder, principal, agent, trustee in bankruptcy or guarantor of a party making or defending any claim hereunder.  Any decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all of the parties hereto and said decision and award may be entered as a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding said Rules, any arbitration hearing to take place hereunder shall be conducted in Chicago, Illinois, before one (1) arbitrator who shall be an attorney who has substantial experience in commercial law issues.  In the event of any arbitration between the parties hereto involving the Terms of Use or the respective rights of the parties hereunder, the party who does not prevail in such arbitration shall pay all the prevailing party’s reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees, costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in resolving said matter.  As used herein the term ‘prevailing party’ shall include, but not be limited to, a party who obtains legal counsel or brings an action against the other by reason of the other’s breach or default and obtains substantially the relief sought whether by compromise, settlement, or judgment.  Each party hereby consents to a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding of multiple claims, or claims involving two (2) or more parties.  Either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for interim, temporary, or preliminary injunctive relief in aid of the arbitration proceedings, or to enforce the arbitration award, but not otherwise. Any such application to a court shall not be deemed incompatible or a waiver of this provision.  The arbitrator shall be required to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its award.  Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator(s) may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.  By your use of the Site, you consent to the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association and waive any objection which you may have to any proceeding so commenced based upon improper venue or forum non coveniens.
13. Miscellaneous. The Terms of Use shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the respective legal representatives, successors, and assigns of each of the parties.  In the event that any of the provisions of the Terms of Use shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible and the remaining portion of the Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. You have read the Terms of Use completely and have had the opportunity to seek the advice and assistance of competent legal counsel.  Duraco may immediately terminate or suspend your Site account or use of the Site at our discretion at any time and without notice.
