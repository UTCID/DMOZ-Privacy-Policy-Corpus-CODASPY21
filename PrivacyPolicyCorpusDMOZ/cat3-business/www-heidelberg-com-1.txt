Use of the Heidelberg Assistant and the app
If you register to use the Heidelberg Assistant, you will be asked to provide the following information: last name, first name, e-mail address, country, and customer affiliation. Providing the information is voluntary. If you provide us with this information, we will use it to identify users and to make personal and individual content of the app visible.If users receive a voucher from us, these vouchers will be assigned to user e-mail addresses and displayed within the app, provided that the user logs into the app with this e-mail address. We receive the e-mail address via the registration; the allocation of vouchers by HDM AG and its Sales and Service Center.When you set up the app, you will be asked if the app is allowed to send you notifications. If you agree, we will use push notifications to send you alerts about the app, as well as marketing messages. The service then sends the registration ID (Android) or the token (iOS) to the registered device. The app sends the ID or token to the server, where it is stored in a database. If a push notification is to be sent, the server sends the desired message with registration ID/token to the platform’s push service, which forwards the push notification to the respective devices. You can suspend receipt of push notifications when not using the app by explicitly logging out of the app.You can revoke your consent to receive push notifications via the operating system as follows: iOS/Settings//NotificationsAndroid/Settings/Applications/Applications Manager//Notifications When you use our app, the data that is sent by your browser during usage and that is required to use our services is automatically recorded. This data includes the IP address, installation ID, operating system, platform (iOS, Android, Windows), and the date and time of use of our services.

The IP addresses of the requesting devices are also logged. Access is registered for reasons of data security, to ensure the stability and operational reliability of our system and to protect against possible external attacks. In addition, the data is statistically evaluated to optimize the services we offer. It is not possible to trace which contents you have accessed or which files you have retrieved on the basis of the logged data. The temporary collection of the data is necessary in order to enable the delivery of the content to the terminal devices and to guarantee its reproduction. This data is not merged with other data sources. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. For the storage of data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. It is possible that the data may additionally be stored with our technical service providers for statistical purposes, inter alia. In this case, the IP address will be deleted or masked so that the calling device can no longer be assigned. The collection of data for the provision of the app and its storage is absolutely necessary for the operation of the service, so that there is no option for the user to object. The legal basis for the processing of user account/master data and the assignment of performance data and communication data is the fulfillment of our contract with you for the provision of the Heidelberg Assistant and your content in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. The legal basis for the processing of push notifications, and for information and marketing purposes, is our legitimate interest in providing users with relevant information about the Heidelberg Group in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
