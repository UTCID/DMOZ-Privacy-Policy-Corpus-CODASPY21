1. NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR INVESTMENT ADVICE
The funds advised by Crosslink are not offered through the Site. An offer regarding any such fund may be made only after you have received a Confidential Offering Circular, Private Placement Memorandum or Private Offering Memorandum concerning that fund and have had the opportunity to discuss all matters concerning any prospective investment that you desire. The Site does not provide all information material to an investor’s decision to invest in any such fund, including, but not limited to, risk factors. For more information, please refer to a fund’s Confidential Offering Circular, Private Placement Memorandum or Private Offering Memorandum and read it carefully before you invest.
The information on the Site is intended to enable investors to understand the nature of Crosslink’s financial advisory services. It is not intended as and does not constitute investment advice or legal or tax advice or an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any securities. The information in the Site should not be construed as any endorsement, recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security by Crosslink. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or retrieving any information found on the Site, and Crosslink urges you to make sure you understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Site. You should evaluate the information made available through the Site, and you should seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other information. You agree that Crosslink is not liable for any action you take or decision you make in reliance on any information on the Site.
Crosslink’s services are designed to integrate with the services provided by its clients’ other financial, legal and tax advisers, not to replace their services. Crosslink advises its clients from time to time on non-investment related matters, but clients must rely on their other professional advisers for final approval and/or implementation of non-investment matters.
You acknowledge that any requests for information are unsolicited and any information provided shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice by Crosslink to you or constitute the formation of an investment advisory relationship, or any other client relationship. It is strongly recommended that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. Crosslink does not guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. Crosslink may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Site.
