KEEN Cookie Statement
This Cookie Statement explains how KEEN, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("we", "us", and "ours") use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our KEEN-branded websites ("Websites") and to any websites, branded pages on third party platforms (such as Facebook or YouTube) and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. Please note that we use the term "cookies" in this Cookie Statement to refer to website cookies and to similar technologies that may collect information automatically when you visit the Website (such as pixel tags, web beacons, device IDs and similar technologies).
What are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
Cookies set by the website owner are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
How long do cookies last for?
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies'. These cookies exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are 'persistent cookies'. These cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date. They can be used by websites to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.
Why do we use cookies?
We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in the table below:
Types of cookie
Who serves these cookies
How to refuse
Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
We set certain Salesforce Commerce Cloud cookies.
Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Websites to you, you cannot refuse them.
You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings however, as described below under the heading "How can I control cookies?".
Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use.  However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable.
We and third parties set certain performance and functionality cookies.
To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading "How can I control cookies?"
Alternatively, please click on the relevant opt-out link on the applicable third party website.
Analytics and customisation cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Websites for you.
We and third parties, including Google Analytics, set analytics and customization cookies.
To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading "How can I control cookies?"
Alternatively, please click on the relevant opt-out link on the applicable third party website.
Advertising cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.  They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
We and third parties set advertising cookies.
To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading "How can I control cookies?"
Alternatively, please click on the relevant opt-out link on the applicable third party website.
Social networking cookies: These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Websites through third party social networking and other websites.  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.
Third parties, including Facebook and Twitter, set social networking cookies.
To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading "How can I control cookies?"
Alternatively, please click on the relevant opt-out link on the applicable third party website.
What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
Do you serve targeted advertising?
Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to our Websites and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.
How can I control cookies?
You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above.
You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
We don't control the setting of third-party cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.
In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices or www.youronlinechoices.com.
How often will you update this Cookie Statement?
We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
The date at the top of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.
Where can I get further information?
If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at info@keenfootwear.com.
