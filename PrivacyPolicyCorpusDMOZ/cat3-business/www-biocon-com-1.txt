The purpose of this law is to protect the citizens of the European Union from all breaches related to data and privacy. Although, most of the previous directives related to privacy policies will still be applicable, the following rights will also come into play:Notification of BreachAccording to this policy, breach notification will be sent if there is a breach within a period of 72 hours. Not only just the customers, the data processors will also have to notify the controllers, the moment they get to know there is a breach.Data AccessWith GDPR law in action, you now have the right to obtain the data controller confirmation. You can know whether or not your personal data is being processed, if so then where and for what purpose. You will also be provided with a copy of your personal data, free of charge.Data ErasingNow, you have the right to control the amount of time, Biocon Limited will have any information on you. You can also choose to erase the data after a certain period of time. As of article 17 of the GDPR law, the user may choose to erase the data if it is no longer relevant to the procedure for which it was processed. Although, the controller will compare the subject rights to the “the public interest in the availability of the data” while processing such requests.Porting the DataAdhering to the GDPR law, Biocon Limited will be bringing along with it the option of data portability, which means you will have the right to receive the personal data that concerns you. You will also have the right to transfer this data to another controller.Privacy by DesignAs per the GDPR law, the inclusion of data protection will be a part of designing systems, instead of an addition. According to article 23 of GDPR, all controllers will be able to hold and process data which are absolutely necessary for the completion of duties.Protection Officers for Your DataUnder this law, data controllers won’t have to submitt notifications and registrations to local DPAs regarding data processing activities. Now, data controllers will have to keep internal records and it will be mandatory to have DPO (Data Protection Officer) appointments, especially for those who process operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale.Data ControllerBiocon Limited is the controller of your personal information.It is possible that we may need to disclose personal data when required by law. We will disclose such data wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Contact UsCorporate Communications 20th KM, Hosur Road, Electronic City, Bangalore, India – 560 100 Email: corporate.communications@biocon.comQuick LinksCOVID-19 ResponseHomeAbout UsInvestorsCareersFact SheetKey Therapeutic AreasNewsResponsibilityProductsBusinessesGenericsBiosimilarsNovel BiologicsResearch ServicesRecommended SitesABLEDBTIBABScience GalleryGet in TouchSitemapContact Us
