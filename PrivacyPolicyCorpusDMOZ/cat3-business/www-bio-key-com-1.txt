This privacy policy explains how we collect information pertaining to businesses and business people (“Business Information”) and all other types of information through our website and online services (the “Site”); how we collect, maintain and use that information; and how you can manage the way information about you is handled. For individuals residing in the EEA or Switzerland, please scroll down the section titled “Information for Users in Europe and Elsewhere Outside the U.S.” to find out more information.

The date the form was sent or received
Email addresses, names and job titles of recipients and senders
To ensure the integrity of the database, we take the following steps:
Business Information Only – BIO-key only wants business-related information. Company name, employee’s name, job title and department, email address, business phone numbers, address of company, etc.
Anonymity – All individuals who visit our Site’s personal information will remain anonymous unless they unless they willingly provide us with their information via a “form fill out,” submit any inquiry on our site’s “Contact Us” page or other contribution methods.
