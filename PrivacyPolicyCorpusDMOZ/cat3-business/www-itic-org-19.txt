Advances in wired and wireless broadband technology have dramatically changed the way we work, play, and connect with each other. Futureproof fiber optics and the next generation of wireless network technology, or 5G, will be transformational. Through forward-looking policy that supports research and development, enables access to spectrum, takes into account security, considers the important role of standards, and provides government incentives and funding to ensure ubiquitous access to connectivity, countries around the world can ensure the successful deployment of broadband and 5G technology. To enable the United States and countries around the world to fully reap the benefits of this technology, ITI works to develop and promote policies that will advance the deployment of cutting-edge network technology.
5G holds immense promise for innovation, and it will have a tremendous economic impact, enabling $13.2 trillion in economic output globally by 2035 (source). ITI recently released its 5G Policy Principles, which provide recommendations for policymakers in the U.S. and around the world as they consider how to most effectively and efficiently deploy 5G technology. Pursuant to Congress’ direction in the Secure 5G and Beyond Act, the Trump Administration recently released the National Strategy to Secure 5G, which will help guide a whole-of-government approach to securely roll out 5G networks. ITI is working with the White House, members of Congress, the FCC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to support efforts associated with this Strategy and advocate for the comprehensive set of policies necessary to success.
Around the world, ITI is meeting with policymakers to explain the ways in which broadband and 5G technology will be transformative and advocate for similar policies advance the secure deployment of next generation networks.
ITI's 5G Policy Principles and 5G Essentials for Global Policymakers
As policymakers seek to promote 5G deployment, there are four key areas where sound policy approaches and government action are essential: innovation and investment; deployment and access to spectrum; security; and standards. ITI’s 5G Policy Principles for Global Policymakers offer an expert guide to help steer these efforts, while helping governments maximize opportunities and address challenges related to the deployment of this technology.
Among its recommendations, ITI calls for policymakers to create 5G security-related policies that are risk-based; address threats to the 5G ecosystem beyond those associated with specific supply chain actors and equipment; and leverage government and industry collaboration. On standards, ITI encourages policymakers to support globally harmonized 5G standards or technical specifications and calls on governments to uphold and promote best practices in all fora where standards and specifications are being developed. ITI also encourages governments to support open and interoperable solutions for 5G networks by adopting policies that promote R&D funding for open 5G architectures.
In addition to its 5G Policy Principles, ITI released 5G Essentials for Global Policymakers, an informative tool that policymakers, industry partners, and other stakeholders can use to understand the policy recommendations that ITI sets forth.
