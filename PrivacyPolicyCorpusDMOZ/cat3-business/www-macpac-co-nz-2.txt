EARNING AIR NEW ZEALAND AIRPOINTS™ AT MACPAC
Macpac is proud to be an Airpoints™ partner. You can collect Airpoints Dollars™ each time you make a purchase at any Macpac store and scan your valid Airpoints™ card, or when you make a purchase online and enter your Airpoints™ number at the checkout. You will earn Airpoints™ at a rate equivalent to 1 Airpoints Dollar™ per $115 spent or a percentage of an Airpoints Dollar™ based on the percentage of $115 spent.
It’s important to note that Airpoints™ will not be earned on the freight component of an online purchase. From time to time we may offer extra Airpoints Dollars™ on items in store, and these items and/or the number of Airpoints Dollars™ may change at any time without notice. We may also make limited time Airpoints Dollars™ offers direct to select Airpoints™ members at our discretion.
When you use a Macpac Gift Card to pay for your purchases you will also earn Airpoints™, but not when you purchase the Gift Card. Airpoints Dollars™ are not applicable to cash withdrawn as part of an EFTPOS transaction. Airpoints Dollars™ cannot be redeemed or used as payment in Macpac stores or on our websites. Airpoints Dollars™ earned at Macpac will be loaded onto your Airpoints™ account within one month.
Triple Airpoints Dollars™ apply only to non-clearance Macpac branded packs purchased online and in-store between 12.01am Tuesday 3rd November to 11.59pm Tuesday 10th November, while stocks last. The offer does not apply to Macpac pack accessories or wheeled luggage. To earn Airpoints Dollars you must scan a valid Airpoints card at the time of purchase.
