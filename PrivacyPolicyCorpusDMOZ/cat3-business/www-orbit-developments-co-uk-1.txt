As Stockport’s business community prepares for recovery post-coronavirus, a new website – www.skbusinessrecovery.co.uk is helping to support businesses through the phases of recovery.
The new website provides a portal to a wealth of information and support tools to help businesses quickly navigate their way through the complexities brought about as a result of the coronavirus. It has been designed to help businesses and the economy recover from the considerable impact of Covid-19, including a forum where users can seek advice,  share experiences and discuss ideas.
The ‘SK Recovery’ website is also a platform to showcase innovation, where businesses have been inspired to revise their business models, to look for opportunities, to trial new ideas and to launch new products.
The website provides access to a valuable resource normally only available to those who have the means to secure an experienced and expensive executive board. The Stockport Recovery Support Board, a team of experienced professionals, are on hand to provide expert guidance via a regular webinar and to support businesses to develop their recovery plan.
The site also share ideas on how to manage the crisis on a day-to-day basis, and to build recovery for the future as the borough moves through the various phases returning to a new normal.
Cllr Elise Wilson, leader of Stockport Council, said:
“In a short space of time the coronavirus has dramatically affected the way we live our lives. This has left people feeling worried and businesses of all shapes and sizes have been left uncertain about their future.
“To help out, we’ve joined forces with businesses in Stockport to create a website for our business community. The SK recovery website will provide advice from experienced and well respected business leaders and contain forums where businesses can support each other.
“Our long term recovery lies upon our ability to help each other so collectively we can continue to deliver for everyone.”
Cllr David Meller, Cabinet Member for Economy and Regeneration, said:
“Our recovery is going to be shaped around supporting Stockport businesses and within it, the local community.
“The website will allow local businesses to develop closer links with one another, which can then support buying and using each other’s services.
“This is essential. By doing this, we can help ensure any economic benefits are retained within Stockport so we bounce back from this crisis strongly and begin to ‘build back better’.
“Alongside this, we are developing our longer-term economic recovery plan that will ensure Stockport remains one of the best places to invest and do business in.”
