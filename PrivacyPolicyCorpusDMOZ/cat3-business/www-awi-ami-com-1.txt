This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains how Aerospace Manufacturing Inc,(AMI), “we”, “us”, and “our” protect your privacy when you use the following Web sites (our “Sites”):
Aerospace Manufacturing Inc. (“AMI”) owns the Site located at aerospacemanufacturing.com. When we wish to describe how one particular Site uses or shares information you submit to it, we will do so by describing how the “Owner” of the Site uses or shares your information.
This Policy covers the “personal information” we collect through our Sites. “Personal information” is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Examples of personal information include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and the information you provide when you request a catalog, subscribe to a newsletter, or make a purchase at one of our online stores.
The terms “you” and “your,” when used in this Policy, mean any user of our Sites.
This Policy is part of the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of our Sites. To review our Terms and Conditions, click here.
Your Consent to This Policy
Please take a few minutes to review this Policy. By accessing or using our Sites, you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS POLICY, PLEASE EXIT AND DO NOT USE OUR SITES.
Changes to This Policy
As we add new features and functionality to our Sites, we may need to update or revise this Policy. We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on our Sites. These changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on our Sites. They will apply only to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised version. Your use of one of our Sites following any such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Policy. For this reason, it is important to review this Policy regularly. If we modify this Policy, we will provide a notice at the top of this Policy for at least thirty days after the new effective date.
You may access the current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy Policy” at the bottom of each page of our Sites.
Privacy Notices
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”) provided at the time we collect your personal information. For example, certain pages of our Sites may contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. Our Privacy Notices are part of this Policy.
Country-Specific Notices
Privacy requirements vary from country to country. To meet these requirements we may include certain “country-specific notices” as part of this Policy. If any of the terms of a country-specific notice are different than the general terms of this Policy, the terms of the country-specific notice will supplement or amend this Policy, but only to the extent that the laws of that country apply to the collection of personal information through our Sites.
What Personal Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Sites?Information You Provide. We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your mouse and keyboard) when you use our Sites. The information we collect depends on how you use our Sites. For example:
If you sign up to receive e-mail communications from us, we collect your name and e-mail address and any related information you provide.
If you make a purchase at one of our online stores, we collect the information you submit when you place your order, including your credit card and shipping information. If you ship an item to another person, we collect the information you provide about that person, such as his/her name, address and other contact information.
If you upload photographs, comments or other user generated content (“User Generated Content”) to our Sites, including to any “Bragging Board,” we collect that information also. All User Generated Content you upload to our Site must comply with our Terms and Conditions.
Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser.

Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
This information does not identify you personally. Generally, we use this information to improve our Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. In most cases, we do not link the information sent by your browser to information that identifies you personally.

We may also link your IP address to personally identifiable information you submit in placing an order. In addition, when you access our Sites by clicking on a link in an e-mail or other electronic communication you receive from us, your browser tells us that someone has clicked on a particular link in a communication addressed to you. We collect that information to improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We may also review our server logs which contain visitors’ IP addresses for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.
Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use “cookies” and other Web technologies to collect information and support certain features of our Sites. For example, we may use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites-which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page; to support the features and functionality of our Sites-for example, to track the items in your shopping cart; to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database; and to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to our Sites; and to personalize your experience when you use our Sites.
Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by signing up to use a password-protected area of our Sites, we may link this information we collect using Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.
