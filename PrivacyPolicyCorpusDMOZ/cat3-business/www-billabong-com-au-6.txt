1. INTRODUCTION
This terms of use agreement (“Agreement”) applies to this website and all other Australian and New Zealand websites operated by Boardriders Group associated with Billabong International Limited, GSM (Operations) Pty Ltd and Ug Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd  (collectively “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) and all websites that refer or link to this Agreement (collectively “Sites”).
In this Agreement, “you” and “your” means the individual accessing or using any of the Sites and where you are accessing the Sites in your capacity as an employee of or contractor to a body corporate or other legal entity, “you” includes your employer or the entity that is engaging you. By using the Sites, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and any and all rules, guidelines and directions found throughout the Sites. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you must not use or access our Sites. If you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, we may terminate your right to use and access our Sites.
Please read this Agreement carefully. This Agreement applies to all users of the Sites, including users who are viewers of material on the Sites and users who register for the Sites as set out below in Section 7. By using the Sites you also represent that you are at least 18 years old or have your parent or guardian’s consent to use the Sites. Company does not knowingly collect personally identifiable informatiTon from users under the age of 18. Such users are expressly prohibited from submitting their personally identifiable information to us and any information submitted by such users will not knowingly be used, posted, or retained by us. You may not use or register for the sites if you are under the age of 18 unless you have the consent of a parent or guardian.
In addition, when you use any current or future version of the Sites, you also will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Please print a copy of this Agreement for your records. We may, from time to time, modify the terms of this Agreement. When we make changes, we will post those in a new Terms of Use Agreement. Your use of the Sites following any such modification constitutes your agreement to the terms of the modified Agreement. You should visit this page periodically to learn of any changes to this Agreement.
2. PRIVACY
To understand our privacy practices, please review our Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://www.billabong.com.au/customer-help/privacy-policy.html">. The terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy form part of this Agreement.
3. CONSIDERATION
You acknowledge that this Agreement is supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged. Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge that such consideration includes, without limitation, your use of the Sites and receipt of data, materials and information available at or through the Sites.
4. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
By using the Sites, you and the Company agree that if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Sites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of these Terms of Use or any part of it (“Dispute”), both parties must first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute (“Dispute Notice”) and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond in writing (“Reply Notice”). A Dispute Notice or Reply Notice must be sent:
the Company at:
Attention: Legal Department
1 Billabong Place
Burleigh Heads QLD 4220
to you at your last-used billing address of the billing and/or shipping address that we may have on file for you or, if no such address has been provided, to any email address that you may have provided to us or used to register for an accountant on any of our Sites. If you issue us with a Dispute Notice and you have otherwise not provided us with a contact address through registration or similar, please provide us with an email address and address we may reply to.
Both you and the Company agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party, provided however that nothing in this Agreement will prevent a party seeking urgent injunctive or similar interim relief from a court.
If a Dispute Notice and Reply Notice are given, then you agree to discuss (either in person or by telephone) the Dispute with an authorised representative of the Company in an effort to resolve the Dispute. At least one meeting or discussion relating to the Dispute must take place within 30 days of service of a Reply Notice.
If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days of service of a Reply Notice or if a Reply Notice is not given by the relevant party, then the parties agree to try to resolve the Dispute by mediation, to be held in Gold Coast, Queensland Australia and administered by the Australian Disputes Centre according to its Guidelines for Commercial Mediation (“Guidelines”). The Guidelines set out the procedures to be adopted, the process of selection of the mediator and the costs involved. If the Dispute is not settled within 30 days after the referral of the Dispute to mediation, then either party may commence legal proceedings in relation to the Dispute.
5. GOVERNING LAW
This agreement is governed by the laws in force in the State of Queensland, Australia. You irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Queensland and of the Commonwealth of Australia in respect of any matter relating to this Agreement or the access and use of any of our Sites.

15. RISK OF LOSS

16. PRODUCT INFORMATION
We attempt to be accurate in describing our products and services on the Sites. We do not warrant that product and service descriptions or other content on this or any other Sites are complete reliable, current or error-free.
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours of our products that appear on the Sites. However, as the actual colours you see depend on your computer monitor and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee that your computer’s display on any colour on the Sites will be accurate.
Most products displayed in the Sites are available in select retail stores. In some cases, products displayed for sale at the Sites may not be available in retail stores. Unless otherwise stated, the prices displayed on Sites are quoted in Australian or New Zealand Dollars as applicable.
We may choose to not fill any orders (or part of an order) that you have placed where the website contains errors or inaccuracies, including without limitation, errors, inadequacies or out-of-date information regarding pricing, shipping, payment terms, or return policies.
17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
THE SITES ARE PROVIDED BY COMPANY ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY GUARANTEES THAT CANNOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED, COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SITES OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR LINKED SERVICES PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH THE SITES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SITES WILL BE FREE FROM ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, OR DELAY IN OPERATION, OR FROM TECHNICAL INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS; THAT THE SITES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; THAT DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE CONTENT ON THE SITES IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ANY INFORMATION ON THE SITES IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE, AND WE DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CHANGES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
IN AUSTRALIA, OUR PRODUCTS COME WITH GUARANTEES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT PURPORTS TO MODIFY OR EXCLUDE THAT CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES AND UNDERTAKINGS, AND OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, UNDER THE COMPETITION AND CONSUMER ACT 2010 (CTH) AND OTHER LAWS. ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHICH ARE NOT GUARANTEED BY THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW OR THE COMPETITION AND CONSUMER REGULATIONS ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED WHERE PERMITTED, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES CAUSED BY BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION.
IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY, OR ANY PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SITES, BE LIABLE FOR (AND ANY LIABILITY IS HEREBY EXCLUDED FOR) ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE OR NATURE ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES OR ANY LINKED SITES OR SERVICES; IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY INTERCEPTS OR DECRYPTS ANY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO COMPANY THROUGH THE SITES; OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, WHETHER IN AN ACTION UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
Company makes no representation that the contents of the Sites comply with the laws of any country outside Australia. If you access any of the Sites from outside Australia, you do so at your own risk and you are responsible for ensuring compliance with all laws in the place where you are located.
Company does not warrant that it will be able to prevent any illegal, harmful or inappropriate use, modification or alteration of the Sites or that it will give notice of such use, modification or alteration.
Where any applicable legislation implies any warranties, guarantees or conditions or imposes obligations upon Company which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified except to a limited extent, this Agreement must be read subject to those statutory provisions. If those statutory provisions apply, then to the extent to which Company is able to do so, its liability will be limited, at its option, to: (a) in the case of any goods supplied by Company, either: (i) replacement of the goods or supply of equivalent goods; (ii) repair of the goods; (iii) payment of the cost of replacing the goods or acquiring equivalent goods; or (iv) payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or (b) in the case of any services performed by Company, either: (i) the performance of the services again; or (ii) the payment of the cost of having the services performed again.
18. INDEMNITY
You indemnify the Company against any claims, proceedings, losses, liabilities, costs or other expenses (including legal costs) and third party claims incurred by Company in connection with or arising, whether directly or indirectly, as a result of your breach of the terms of this Agreement, your use or access of the Sites or any violation of any applicable law in connection with this Agreement.
19. MISCELLANEOUS LEGAL PROVISIONS
Company may discontinue the Sites at any time and for any reason, without notice. Company may change, suspend, or cancel the contents, operation, or any and all other features of the Sites at any time for any reason, without notice.
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Company as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Sites. Nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Sites or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Company’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement or respond to a breach by you or other parties is not in any way a waiver its right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of this Agreement or to act with respect to similar breaches. You must not resell or assign your rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempted assignment or delegation will be void and of no force or effect whatsoever. This Agreement may be automatically assigned by Company, in our sole discretion, to a third party, and such an assignment will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and/or licensees. Without limiting the foregoing, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your personal information, with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, and a company under our common control, as well as with a potential acquirer, lender, or investor, including in connection with a merger, reorganisation, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In each such event, the personal information we have collected from you may be one of the assets transferred.
If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.
This Agreement constitutes the entire and final agreement regarding the Sites and its contents, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous communications between you and Company regarding the Sites and their contents.
All rights not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved to Company.
