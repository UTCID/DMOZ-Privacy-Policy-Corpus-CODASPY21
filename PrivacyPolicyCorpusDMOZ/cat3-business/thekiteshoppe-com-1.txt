When using The Kite Shoppe shopping cart, your credit card and personal details are protected by PostiveSSL® - 128 bit SSL encryption, which you can see engage during the check out process using our shopping cart (httpS://).
The SSL (and TLS) protocol is the Web standard for encrypting communications between users and SSL (secure sockets layer) e-commerce sites.
