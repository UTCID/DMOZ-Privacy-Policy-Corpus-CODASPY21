Wicked Talent, L.L.C. ("Wicked Talent") has created this privacy
statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy to our
customers and users of our online services, websites, and web services
("Services"). This privacy policy governs the manner in which Wicked
Talent uses, maintains and discloses information collected from its
customers and users of our Services.
1. Privacy
Wicked Talent is committed to developing long lasting
relationships based on trust. As such, Wicked Talent will do everything
in its power to ensure that your right to privacy is maintained and
protected. Our Services are not directed at children under 13 years of
age.
2. Information We Collect
Wicked Talent may request or collect personal information
from online users in a variety of ways, including through online forms
for applying for accounts, updating your profiles, and other instances
where users are invited to volunteer such information.
The information we collect is personal information that identifies you
personally, such as:
First & last name
Other biographical information
Previous experience in the industry
Postal address
Telephone and fax numbers
URLs
E-mail address
Other billing information
Wicked Talent may also collect information about how users access our
Services using a tracking ID unique to each user through the use of
cookies or other similar means.
3. What are Cookies?
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer
tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies
and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your
browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent
cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive
for an extended period of time.
Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for
removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Wicked
Talent to track user preferences while the user is using our Services.
They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing.
Persistent cookies may be used by Wicked Talent to store whether, for
example, you want your password remembered or not, and other
information. Cookies used on Wicked Talent websites do not contain
personally identifiable information.
4. Log Files
Like most standard websites, we use log files. This
information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type,
date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the
site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the
information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP
addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.
5. How we use this Information
Wicked Talent may use the personally identifiable
information collected by Wicked Talent to contact customers regarding
products and services offered by Wicked Talent and, to the extent the
User has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent
contractors and business partners.
We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the
effectiveness of our Services and marketing and sales efforts. Wicked
Talent will not in any way share this information with a third party
either for free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorize such
disclosures.
6. Disclosure of Information
Wicked Talent may also disclose aggregate, anonymous, data
based on information collected from Users to investors and potential
partners. In such cases, statistical information only will be disclosed
and personally identifiable data will be kept strictly confidential. In
case Wicked Talent is sold, the information collected from users may be
transferred to the new owners.
Wicked Talent may from time to time engage third parties, including its
own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or
otherwise store or manipulate data received by Wicked Talent from its
customers. In all such cases, such third party service providers will be
required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as Wicked
Talent and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any
other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy
Policy.
7. Special Offers and Updates
Our customers and users will occasionally receive
information on products, services, special deals, and possibly a
newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the
option to not receive these types of communications.
8. Service Announcements
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly
service related announcement, if, for instance, our service is
temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out
of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.
However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
9. Legal Disclaimer
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may
need to disclose personal information when required by law, if we have a
good-faith belief that such action is necessary and required to comply
with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
served on Wicked Talent.
Wicked Talent websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware
that Wicked Talent is not responsible for the privacy practices of such
other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and
every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. The
Wicked Talent Privacy Policy as described herein applies solely to
information collected by Wicked Talent.
10. Maintenance of Information
The information provided to Wicked Talent is saved
indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly or
indirectly maintained by Wicked Talent. Wicked Talent employs industry
standard security measures to protect the confidentiality of the
information.
While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will
not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences. Any other
particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers
collected for commercial transactions, is encrypted prior to
transmission by you to Wicked Talent.
11. Your Responsibility
You are responsible for the security of the login
information, such as usernames and passwords, which give you access to
your private information maintained by Wicked Talent. Make sure you keep
login information in a safe place and do not share it with others.
Note that key-loggers, viruses, or other surveillance devices can
intercept login information on the computers from which you access our
Services, so you should take precautions regarding such devices,
especially from public computers. In addition, you should always log out
from any relevant Services when you are not actively using them.
