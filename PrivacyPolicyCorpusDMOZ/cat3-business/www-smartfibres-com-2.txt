We continue to develop, manufacture and sell a broad range of industry-leading FBG interrogator products, and can supply FBG sensors with an instrument sale.Our FBG interrogators are all based on a tunable laser that is qualified for 25 years life for the telecoms industry. By adding our proprietary high-speed laser drive and photodetector electronics, we have produced a suite of instruments with extraordinary resolution, accuracy, ruggedness and price. This sets us aside from the competition developing interrogators based on swept laser or spectrometer architectures that are far more susceptible to their environment and are dependent on custom components that drive up the cost.Please click the product of interest below for more information.SmartScanA high-speed interrogator for dynamic measurements or, with averaging, for ultra-high-resolution quasi-static measurements.View moreSmartScan Aero MiniA miniaturised SmartScan suitable for aerospace flight or other harsh environment applications.View moreSmartScan SBIA Complete Single Board FBG Interrogator offering SmartScan performance on an OEM module suitable for client integration.View moreSBI Processing ModulePC104 format processing module to connect SmartScan SBI to an external PC.
