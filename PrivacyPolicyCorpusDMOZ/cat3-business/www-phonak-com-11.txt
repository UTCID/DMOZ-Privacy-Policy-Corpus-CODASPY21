VII. Risk-free trials
Sonova USA Inc. does not provide professional hearing health services and accordingly does not provide hearing instrument risk-free trials directly to end users.  Free trials of Phonak brand hearing instruments are provided by participating third-party hearing health professionals. By submitting the form to take part in a risk-free trial, you are agreeing and consent to be connected by Sonova USA Inc. to a third-party, hearing healthcare professional and agree to the terms and conditions of said third-party for a hearing devicerisk-free trial.  The length of the risk-free trial, cancellation period, rates and professional fees, hearing test and other details are solely the responsibility of the third-party hearing health professional. Phonak does not endorse any third party hearing health professional. Certain types of hearing loss may require a Phonak brand hearing instrument make or model that is not appropriate for a risk-free trial. Neither Sonova USA Inc. nor any of its affiliates are responsible or liable for any damages whatsoever (including indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other damages) arising out of or relating in any way to a risk-free trial.
