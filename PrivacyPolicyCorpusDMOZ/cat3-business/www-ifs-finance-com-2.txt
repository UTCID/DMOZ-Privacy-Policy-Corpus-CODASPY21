Please e-mail techsupport@ifs-finance.com with your name and broker number and we will contact you with your new password. Or you can give us a call at 1-800-565-1153.
Broker Online Account Browser
How do I search for accounts?
To search for an account enter the client's last name or their full account number in the search field and press the search button. When searching by name, the simpler the better. Usually it is more effective to search by last name, or partial last name.
For example entering "Mac" would return all the clients who's last name starts with "Mac". If you are searching for someone who has a common name, such as MacDonald, and you would like to narrow down your results, try searching with the last name and their first initial. For example entering "MacDonald,F" (no spaces) would return all clients who's first name starts with "F" and the last name "MacDonald".

Online Reports
With the use of Online Reports you can quickly view clients that are: On Status Intent to Cancel (Pink Slips), On Status Returned Cheque, Due for Cancellation, Cancelled, and New Contracts for the current month. Also you can view All Accounts for your brokerage.
top of page
Color Legend
When reviewing search and report results the color of your client's name shows their account status:
BLACK - Account is OK.
PINK - Accounts which are NSF Cheque & On Intent (14 days overdue, known as Pink Slip).
RED - Accounts which are going to be cancelled when next batch is processed or those that have been cancelled.
top of page
Code Descriptions
The following descriptions should help you navigate and understand the information provided in the Broker Online Account Brower better:
INTENT (On Status Intent to Cancel) - This is also known as the "pink slip." A pink slip is issued when a client is 14 days overdue.
NSFCHQ (On Status Returned Cheque) - The client's payment was NSF (Not sufficient funds) or otherwise not cleared and the cheque was returned.
REPORT (Due For Cancellation) - The client has not paid and an auto intent to cancel date has been set.
NOTE-2 (Cancelled) - The client's account has been cancelled and a final notice has been sent out.

How do I view extended account information?
First perform a search for an account or view an available report. Click on the client's account number, which is highlighted blue, and the details for that account will be shown.

Additional Contracts
If there has been an additional to a contract a separate account is created and the balance of that account is transferred to the client's current account. These accounts are identified by having the current account number beside the client's name. For example if Dave Smith had a current account # 0001904526 and additional was added, the name of the additional account would be SMITH,DAVE (0001904526).
IFS Quick-Quote
The IFS Quick-Quote allows you to get a quote instantly online which can be passed to the Online Contract Generator to generate an IFS Contact ready to sign. For large premiums, quotes requiring additional down payment or any other special quotes please call in for a custom IFS quote.
Custom quotes that are faxed or e-mailed to your office can be found under the Requested IFS Quotes page and passed to the Online Contract Generator to produce an IFS Contract.

What version of Adobe Acrobat is required to view and print contracts?
Adobe Acrobat version 4.0 or higher is required to view and print IFS generated PDF contracts. We recommend that you use Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or higher for optimal performance.
top of page
What is the “Old System”?
The “Old System” generates a HTML web page which displays the completed contract ready to print directly in your web browser. We have upgraded our system to generate contracts in PDF format which still displays in your web browser ready to print.
top of page
What are the benefits of generating contracts in PDF format?
Compatible with all browsers and most operating systems therefore allowing it to display and print properly for more brokers.
Brokers don’t have to adjust margins, etc.
Brokers can save PDF contract to hard drive and attach to client’s electronic file if desired.
Contract can be emailed to client’s or remote offices.

When I click “Generate PDF Contract For Printing” I get a box asking me what I’d like to do with “**********.pdf” (replace *’s with unique number)
Click on the button which allows you to open the document. If you cannot open the document you probably don’t have Adobe Acrobat installed on your system. To fix this install Adobe Acrobat Reader on your system by clicking the “Get Acrobat Reader” button above the “Generate PDF Contract For Printing” button.
top of page
I can’t install Adobe Acrobat Reader on my system
If your system is not compatible with the newest version of Adobe Acrobat check Adobe’s download page for older versions which may work on your system. You can use the “Old System” while you upgrade your system or install Adobe Acrobat Reader.

I am having problems printing the contract from Adobe Acrobat
First you should determine if you have a system wide problem, an Adobe Acrobat problem, or if the PDF contract did not load correctly. First check your printer to ensure that it is turned on and online ready to print. Can you print from other programs? If not there could be a problem with your printer or it may not be setup correctly. Can you print other PDF documents such as the first page of the help file included with Acrobat? If you can but the contract will not print or will not print correctly press the back button in your browser and re-click “Generate PDF Contract For Printing”. Once the contract appears on your screen again press the print icon and ensure that “Shrink Oversized Pages To Paper Size” is selected, then select “Ok” to print the document. If you are still experiencing problems please upgrade your Adobe Acrobat Reader to the newest version and refer to the Troubleshoot printing problems with Acrobat products guide.

When printing a contract using the “Old System” part of the right hand side is missing
To fix this you must adjust your margins to the following specifications:
Under FILE > PAGE SETUP of Internet Explorer, set your TOP, LEFT, RIGHT, and BOTTOM margins to 0.5" (13mm)
Under FILE > PAGE SETUP of Netscape Navigator, set your TOP, LEFT, RIGHT, and BOTTOM margins to 0.3" (8mm)
Netscape is known to not print the lines correctly. We recommend using Internet Explorer 5.5 and above.
