Privacy Policy
The following sets forth the privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy” or the “Policy”) applicable to all individuals that access and otherwise use this Website of Kenwood Management Company, LLC (“Kenwood”).  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THIS WEBSITE OR ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS CONTAINED ON THE WEBSITE. YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE YOUR IRREVOCABLE AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY SET FORTH BELOW.
Some information that identifies You as an individual ("Personal Information") is gathered when You register with this Website, or participate in community activities, focus groups and interviews, and/or other promotions (including incentive programs).  We also collect Personal Information about You to the extent that You provide it to Us online (e.g., by filling out forms on the Website or by submitting such information in an e-mail message) and offline (e.g., by filling out a comment card at one of our locations, or by registering for information concerning our activities).  You provide Your Personal Information voluntarily.
Personal Information requested may include Your name, Your street mailing address, Your email address, Your telephone number and other information, including information about Your personal or business demographics and Your home purchasing preferences.  In addition, We may ask You to enter an ID, password or similar data when You access this Website, so We can verify Your right to access certain portions of this Website. We might also obtain Personal Information about You provided to Us by Your friends/colleagues, including Your name and email address, as this Website may allow visitors to this Website to send information about the Kenwood Community to others via email.  If You choose to tell a friend/colleague about us, We may ask You for Your friend's/colleague’s name and email address. We endeavor to send to Your friend such emails. We may elect not to send the email in certain circumstances in Our discretion (e.g., if the email contains inappropriate or inaccurate information or content).  We store Your friend’s/colleague’s Personal Information for the purposes of sending these emails, tracking the success of Our referral program and promoting the Kenwood brand.  Your friend may contact Us at info@kenwoodmgt.com to request that We remove Your friend's/colleague’s Personal Information from Our database.
How do We use the Personal Information We collect:
Our goals in collecting Personal Information from You include: (i) providing You with information about Kenwood such as: press releases, pricing, properties, news and enhancements, Kenwood  events and other information We deem You may find of interest; (ii) supporting business purposes, and community planning endeavors, that We believe are reasonable and consistent with fair business practices; (iii) notifying You to provide any information regarding any property or industry information that We believe You might be interested in or that You have participated in; and (iv) contacting You concerning phased releases, available properties, upgrades, enhancements, community events or activities, services and products for new opportunities that might be of interest to You.  We also use Your Personal Information to determine other information that will be delivered to You that may be targeted to Your interests, as well as determining what periodic marketing, promotional and other notices to provide to You.  You may, at any time, choose to not receive communications from Us by "opting out" of specific mailing lists and services by sending an email requesting removal to Us at: info@kenwoodmgt.com, or by writing us at the mailing address listed below.
How We Share Personal Information:
We may disclose Your Personal Information to third parties as We deem necessary or desirable to provide products and services that You have requested.  Your Personal Information may also be disclosed to third parties on an aggregate basis and in a manner that does not reveal the personal identity of You or Your business.  For real estate professionals who are participants in our Incentive Programs, as defined below, We may disclose Your Personal Information to a third-party shipper, if applicable, so that any incentives or rewards that You have earned pursuant to the Incentive Program can be shipped and delivered to Your home or business.  We may also disclose Your Personal Information as We believe is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority. Finally, We may disclose Your Personal Information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or a portion of the Kenwood Community or upon any change in our corporate structure.
Promotions and Community Activities:
We may from time to time offer promotions, press releases, and other programs in which We may request Personal Information.  Your participation in any such promotions, activity or program will be subject to the official rules of such promotion or activity, or any release that You may sign, and any additional related conditions that may be posted on this or other applicable Web sites, or as otherwise provided.
Incentive Programs and Similar Promotions for Real Estate Professionals:
We may offer from time to time rewards programs and various other promotions and incentive programs ("Incentive Programs") specifically for real estate professionals, in which We request Personal Information, such as Your name, address, e-mail address and phone number.  The participation of real estate professionals in an Incentive Program will be subject to the terms and conditions, or official rules, of such program, any release You may sign and any additional related conditions that may be posted on this or other applicable Web sites, or as otherwise provided.
Retention and Protection of Personal Information:
Generally, We retain Your Personal Information that We collect electronically on Our server or in Our archives for as long as We reasonably need it.  We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements. For example, We may shorten the retention period for certain Personal Information if needed to free up storage space, and We may lengthen the retention period for other Personal Information if needed to comply with privacy standards or applicable law.
We establish and maintain certain practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of electronic Personal Information stored on Our system.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no computer system is completely secure, and while the measures We implement are intended to reduce the likelihood of security problems, there is no warranty or guarantee that Our standard security measures will prevent access to Your Personal Information.
How to modify Your Personal Information:
You may modify or update Your Personal Information by sending an e-mail to Us at info@kenwoodmgt.com.  Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within Our direct control.
Other Limits to Your Privacy and Confidentiality:
We may disclose Personal Information in special cases when We have reason to believe that disclosing the Personal Information is necessary for Us to protect or enforce Our legal rights, or when We believe that the law requires it, and for administrative and other purposes We deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.
As more fully set forth in the Terms of Use, We operate this Website (including without limitation its registration system) and provide Our services in good faith, but on an “AS-IS”, “WHERE IS”, "WITH ALL FAULTS", “AS-AVAILABLE” basis.
