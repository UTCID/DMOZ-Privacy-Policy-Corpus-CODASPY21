This information includes demographic information and contact information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features or conduct transactions.Information Automatically Collected: MD Audio Engineering may also automatically collect non-personal information and data through the use of Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to enhance your experience using our Website. Through cookies, a website can recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the Website, and allow a site to track usage behavior. MD Audio Engineering does not use cookies to gather personal information about you. Examples of the information we may collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers.The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Website's features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.How is Collected Information Used?We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, fulfilling your orders, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.Does MD Audio Engineering Share Information?MD Audio Engineering is not in the business of selling your information to others. We share customer information only as described below. We have controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: For certain transactions we work closely with our affiliated businesses to package, ship and fulfill your order. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. We may share customer information related to those transactions with third parties.
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers you can let us know by sending an email to info@mdaudio.net.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy Statement (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that MD Audio Engineering, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of MD Audio Engineering and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of MD Audio Engineering, our shareholders, users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
