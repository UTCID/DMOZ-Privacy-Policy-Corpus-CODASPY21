What our customers are saying...
I want to take a second to let you know that I have used United on 90% of our projects for the last 5-6 years and we have been 100% satisfied with the service we have received. I know that with the current market conditions, price is first and foremost in making the decision on who to go with. I do believe if you end up choosing United you will not be disappointed.
Scott J., Concord, CA
The level of service that United Site Services has provided is 5 star. In the 5 years we have been working together, they have never let me down. Whether it be the last minute service call or the after hour service need, they are always there for you. Their customer service staff and drivers are professional, friendly and always on time.
Bobby W., Clackamas, OR
I want to thank United Site Services for going above and beyond to meet our needs and expectations. Last weekend during our rain or shine event we found ourselves unable to use the turf location we had set up the day before because of unpredictable heavy rain overnight. With no time to plan, it was 7am and the clock was ticking, we chose to move our event to a large paved parking lot in the area but only if we could provide restrooms facilities. We had only until 9am to make it all happen. I placed a call to United Site Services and explained my predicament to them and before I knew it, we had replacement units dropped at our new location. Without your commitment to meet our needs in less than 2 hours, our event would have been cancelled. We hope every customer is as happy with your service as we are. United Site Services will be our 1st call for our event next year.
Steve Drew, Foxborough Founders Day, MA
They were here when they said they would be here, they were friendly and very helpful. Since we are a small town, I had called several other companies and all of them hesitated and didn’t want to come out here, but United never acted like our project was too small or hard to find. They were very professional and treated us the same as if we were a large company or project. It was a wonderful experience. Thank you United Site Services.
Janette F., Roanoke, TX
I attended the Niles Antique Fair this past weekend, where I did a Boy Scout fundraiser operating a parking lot. I cannot tell you how often we were complimented on the quality of your portables placed in our parking lot. Our Boy Scouts also appreciated the comfort you provided. And that is coming from some well seasoned scouts and adults. Your company does a great job with a service most people would like to forget.
Chris G. New Haven, CT
I would like to take this opportunity to express to you all what an excellent service you all performed with this years 2008 Sun-n-Fun Fly-In. You truly contributed to making it a success. The new venture we undertook at the Fantasy of Flight for our Splash-in was a grand success. The number of service calls was extremely low considering we were using over 500 portable toilets. And I attribute this to you people taking pride and ownership in your company and services. Again, thank you from the staff at Sun-n-Fun and from me personally. It has been four years of learning on both sides of this venture. I will be organizing the bid process for the upcoming season and certainly solicit your response.
Don H. Lakeland, FL
We just used two restroom trailers at the Landis Beer and Wine Festival and WOW the guests loved them.
Mike W., Landis, NC
Please accept my sincere appreciation for your hard work and support of Naval Air Station Patuxent River’s Air Expo ’09. This featured the U.S. Navy’s Flight Demonstration Squadron the Blue Angels, the U.S. Army’s Golden Knights, the U.S. Air Force F-16 East Coast Demonstration Team and many exciting daredevil civilian performers.
You provided highly valuable support that contributed to the safe and secure environment, so more than 111,000 guests could enjoy this fantastic, thrilling air show. Your steadfast commitment and genuine willingness to go the extra mile made the Air Expo ’09 a resounding success and were deeply appreciated. Congratulations with pleasure for a job WELL DONE!
Andrew M., Patuxent River, MD
We would like to thank you for your services at this year’s Preakness Stakes.
Your equipment that you provided was clean, up to date and well stocked. Everything arrived on time and was set up with no problem and to specification.
Ben H., Maryland Jockey Club
United provided an immediate response, and went above and beyond to help me work within the bride’s budget. I plan to work with this service many times in the future for my event planning business!
Jennifer K., Lexington Park, MD
The Port-a-potty was clean and was the hit of the party which was themed “Under Construction.” The delivery was on time and the people I made contact with (including the delivery guy) were very professional. I would definitely call them again should I need a porta-potty.
Tom C., St. Petersburg, FL
SERVICE is the key word in describing United Site Services. We have appreciated their attention to detail in working with us for the planning of our event, the Denver Marathon, and especially for their services provided on race day.
Ron K., Denver, CO
For the last four years, I have been the Vice President of Operations and Development at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. During that time we have contracted with United Site Services, Inc. as our provider for hundreds of portable toilets at each event, multiple VIP toilet trailers, pumping of thousands of onsite customer campers and the removal of roughly 100,000 gallons of septic prior to the beginning of each event.
Our relationship with the local United Site Services personnel is a large part of the success of these events, as everyone from the Regional VP to the guys on the pump trucks roll up their sleeves and work for a week straight to make sure sewage is NOT one of the problems at NHMS, regardless of the weather.
John Z., NHMS V.P. Operations
Got a hold of me right away, listened to what I needed and got me what I needed. Understood my budget and got me the toilets at a very reasonable price. The staff in the San Jose office were very nice and easy to deal with.
Matt Z., San Francisco, CA
