Use of Cookies
The Insulspan website uses “cookies”. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer’s hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with the Insulspan site or services, a cookie helps Insulspan to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

This information is anonymous, but may become Personally Identifiable upon submitting your information on a form within the Insulspan site.
The third-party email program used by Insulspan employs tracking methods. Insulspan tracks “opens” via a tracking pixel in the email – meaning the company can track who opens e-mail messages and when the e-mail messages are opened. The “clicks” are tracked via encoded URLs – meaning when you click on the links contained in our e-mail messages, we can count how many people chose to visit that page from our email. This information is used internally to help us determine the relevance of our messaging and is not shared with any third parties. You can easily unsubscribe from our emails using the link at the bottom of any message we send.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Insulspan services or other websites you visit.

The third-party analytics companies who collect information on the Insulspan website and/or services and other online products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services.
