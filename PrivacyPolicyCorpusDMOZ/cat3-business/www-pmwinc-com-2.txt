Our copyright agent is Cadence’s Intellectual Property Counsel. The agent can be reached at: .
9. DMCA Infringement Notification.To be effective, your infringement notification must include the following:

Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, including address, telephone number and email address where the complaining party may be contacted;
The following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”; and
The following statement: “The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”

DMCA Infringement Counter Notification.Pursuant to the DMCA, after the alleged infringer receives a notice of infringement from Cadence, the alleged infringer will have the opportunity to respond to Cadence with a counter notification (“Counter Notification”). To be effective, a Counter Notification must be a written communication provided to Cadence’s designated copyright agent, and must include the following:
