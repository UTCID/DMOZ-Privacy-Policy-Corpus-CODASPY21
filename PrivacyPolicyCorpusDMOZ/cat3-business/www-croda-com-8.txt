Our history
Modern slavery statement
The Modern Slavery Act was introduced in 2015. It requires larger businesses to report annually the steps that they are taking to reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place within their supply chains or in any part of their businesses.
We are a recognised industry leader in sustainability, also referred to as Corporate Social Responsibility, having received awards and recognition for our work in this area. To meet the high expectations of our customers and other stakeholders we are continuously striving to evaluate and further improve our responsible sourcing practices and specifically to increase transparency in respect of slavery and human trafficking.
In line with the Modern Slavery Act, we have published our own Statement, which has been approved by the Board.
