Hunter Douglas makes no express or implied warranties, representations or endorsements whatsoever with respect to the site or the content. Hunter Douglas expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, with regard to the site, the content, and any product furnished or to be furnished via the site.

Your exclusive remedy for product claims (including breach of warranty, negligence and strict liability) is limited to having the option of replacement or repayment of the purchase price paid for the products that are the subject of the claim.
Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
