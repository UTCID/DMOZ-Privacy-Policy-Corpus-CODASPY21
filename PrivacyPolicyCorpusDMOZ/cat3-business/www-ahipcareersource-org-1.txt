AMERICA’S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS
PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT
Effective Date:  May 2016
The America’s Health Insurance Plans (“AHIP”) is concerned with safeguarding your privacy on-line.  Accordingly, AHIP has developed this policy statement to assist you in understanding why AHIP collects particular personal identifying information and how AHIP will protect your personal privacy within its Web site (the “Privacy Policy”).  By making you aware of AHIP’s data collection and use practices, we can provide you with better service.
The following information summarizes our personal identifying information gathering and dissemination practices for the AHIP’s United States Web site located at the URL, www.ahip.org, (the “Site”).  Personal identifying information includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.
AHIP reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.  If AHIP makes material changes to this Privacy Policy, AHIP will post those changes at this location so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  Please review this Privacy Policy on a periodic basis.
By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information by AHIP, as described below.
What Information Does AHIP Collect?
Users may visit the website without giving AHIP any personal information. However, users will need to register to gain access to the member-only content, receive customized information, or enroll or participate in an AHIP-sponsored education or training program.
AHIP will collect name, title, employer, mailing address, telephone number, fax number and email address contact demographic information voluntarily provided by individuals who register on AHIP’s website. We also collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from all users of our Site, the date and time of access, and may catalog the type of computer, browser, or operating system used by the user.  For individuals who register for conferences or webinars, enroll in education and training programs or make publications purchases, additional payment-related information may be collected.
How Does AHIP Use that Information?
Until you register to gain access to the member only section of the AHIP website, or register or enroll in an AHIP-sponsored webinar, education or training program, you are able to browse the Site without providing any personal identifying information, although your browser may tell us what type of computer and operating system you are using as well as other kinds of technical information.
Below, is more detail on how AHIP uses the personal identifying information of those individuals who have registered for the member-only section of the site, or registered or enrolled in an AHIP-sponsored webinar, education or training program.
Contact Information:  AHIP may use your contact information, such as name, email address, and mailing address, to provide its services, to advertise its services and the goods and services of third parties, to provide you with news, updates, products, services, upcoming events and other information, and to get in touch with you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted through the Site, or otherwise.  We do share your contact information with webinar and other program sponsors, and our business partners which assist us in providing our services.  Except for sharing arrangements with AHIP’s business partners or as otherwise described in this policy or at the time of collection, we do not share your contact information with other types of third parties for any other purpose, except to a court or governmental agency if required by law or unless we first obtain consent from you to do so.  Site visitors who do not wish to receive notifications or other information via email can choose to opt out of receiving such information at any time so indicating either at time of registration or upon receipt of any promotional email.
Demographic Information:   AHIP may use or share, lease, rent, license, and/or sell demographic data on an aggregated basis, which will not identify any particular user, with our business partners, suppliers, and for advertising purposes.
Transactional Information:   AHIP may use or share, lease, rent, license, and/or sell transactional data on an aggregated basis, which will not identify any particular user with advertisers or other third parties, including our business partners, suppliers, sponsors, and vendors, for business purposes.
Technical Information:   AHIP may use technical information, such as your IP address or browser type, to help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze Site usage trends, track user movements on the Site, and to otherwise manage and monitor our Site.
Business Transactions:   In the event that AHIP goes through a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, please note that the personal identifying information collected and retained by AHIP will be among the assets transferred.
