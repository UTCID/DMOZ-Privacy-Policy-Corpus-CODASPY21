3.2. The types of data we collect
Personal Data for Marketing: Mostly, the personal data we collect is limited to the kinds of information that can be found on a business card or can be retrieved from your email enquiries or face to face meetings, namely your first name, last name, job title, employer name, work address, work email, work phone number and content of communications. If you subscribe to our newsletter via a Preference Centre on our website or a Consent Page, we will collect your email, first name, last name, as well as information about your communication preferences and interests. If you choose to opt out of our mailing list, we will move your name and email address to our suppression list. We can also collect your name or nickname, a photo on social media and content of communications, when you send us a message or interact on our social media pages.
Personal Data for Events: When you register to attend an event organised by us, we may collect your first name, last name, job title, employer name, work address, work email, work phone number and content of communications. In some instances, only when appropriate, we may ask you for other personal data, although this will always be optional, for example, your dietary requirements.
Site Visitor’s Personal Data: When you register to visit any of our sites, we may collect your first name, last name, employer or school name, employer or school address, email, phone number, trade and CSCS Card Number. If you are provided with an induction, we will retain the information about it. We may also collect your photo, biometric data or CCTV footage necessary for health and safety and/or security purposes. If you are under age 13, we require your parents’ or guardians’ consent to process your personal data; this consent is to be collected by the school or educational authority prior to the visit commencing.
Tenants’ Personal Data: When a manger of your property requests us to repair it, we will obtain information with your first name, last name, phone number, address, email, time for availability, property defects, work orders, work completion information and content of communications.
Photography for use in internal and external communications: If we arrange a photography shoot with you, or you are present at an event where we are taking photographs, we will provide an opportunity for you to consent to us using the photographs which feature you. We will clearly outline to you the ways in which we might use these photographs. If you decline to consent, we will neither store nor use your photograph.

4.5. Our marketing policy
We will always exercise restraint and send you only materials that we feel are relevant to your interests.
If you consent via our Preference Centre on the website, we will send you free of charge marketing content which relates to the preferences you have set, until you tell us not to. If you consent via our Consent Page, we will send you marketing content which we select on your behalf, until you tell us not to. You can set/change your preferences or remove your consent at any time via the same Preference Centre.
We host events throughout the year. These include in-person conferences or meetings or sessions we arrange during industry events. We also publish news, insights and information on our services. If you have used our Preference Centre to confirm you want to receive information about events, news, insights or our services, we will send you information in line with your preferences, free of charge, until you tell us not to.
We may also include forms on our website which enable you to sign up for specific events if you wish to, or download content such as insights or information about our services. Any data we collect from these specific forms will only be processed and used for purposes relating to the event or topic that the form relates to. It will not be used as consent to send you any other unrelated marketing content, although we will also offer you an optional opportunity to consent for us to send you carefully selected marketing content that we think you might be interested in, free of charge, until you tell us not to. Alternatively, you can access our Preference Centre and specify which topics you would like us to send you information about, on an ongoing basis, until you tell us not to.
If you make an enquiry to ISG via our website, by email, or face-to-face (e.g. at an event), we may offer you an opportunity to consent to us storing your personal data, and also the option to use our Preference Centre to consent for us to send you information which reflects the preferences you select, on an ongoing basis, until you tell us not to.
