Online Practices ESL Federal Credit Union recognizes the importance of maintaining a presence on the World Wide Web for informational and e-commerce purposes in both attracting new members and retaining existing members. For the purpose of this statement, online activity is defined as the ability of members to access personal account information and general credit union information, to initiate transactions on your credit union accounts, and to apply for additional credit union products and services online. Our privacy policy is the same whether you are online or not. Information We Gather Online We may gather information on how a visitor navigates through the site and areas in which they show interest. We may also gather information such as number of visits to the site, page visits, and length of user sessions. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors of members/users in general, but does not identify individuals in particular. We use this information to better serve you and it helps keep our site relevant and useful by helping us understand what information users want. ESL uses Google Analytics as a tool to gather such information. To understand how ESL uses Google Analytics on esl.org, refer to:
