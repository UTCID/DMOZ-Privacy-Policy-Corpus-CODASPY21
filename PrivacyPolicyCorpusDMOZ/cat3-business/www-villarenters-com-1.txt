Overview
Your personal information is important to us and this document outlines what information we store and how we use it. Our goal is to be open about what and how we use your personal information. Please note that we do not use your personal information unless you provide it to us. When you give us your information we will use it to deliver our service: helping you find and book a holiday rental.
We will not pass on your information to third parties without your consent unless we need to deliver our service. For instance we will need to pass on certain details to:
Property owners and agents when you make an enquiry or a booking.
Our third-party email service provider so they can send you the relevant emails as part of our service.
We will only pass on the minimum information required to deliver our service.
We will also use your information to send you emails about our properties so we can deliver our service as effectively as possible; this will include newsletter and other marketing emails. However you will have the ability to unsubscribe from these emails at any time.
We will also use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, to customise and deliver our services, track the content you look at and manage our advertisements on third party sites. We use cookies in the same way as most other websites for instance to:
Deliver our core functionality such as allowing you to login and remembering your search preferences.
Track site usage patterns with analytics tools such as Google Analytics.
Allow us to use third parties to promote our service. For example we use Google and Facebook tracking technologies so we can display tailored adverts in your Facebook feed, Google’s own websites and websites in the Google display network.
For more information please read our “Cookies and other tracking technologies” section.
Your personal data
To be able to process bookings we need to collect certain personal details from you. These details will include, where applicable:
In the case of a Renter: the names of the Renter and members of the Renter’s Party, their ages, at least the Renter’s contact details (including email address), at least the Renter’s credit/debit card details which we do not store; and
In the case of an Owner: the Owner’s name, contact details (including email address), bank account details, details of the Property
If we need further personal data we will ask for them.
We use the contact details to communicate with the Owner and Renter.
If you make an order or purchase goods or services through our website, we may disclose to the supplier of the goods or service your personal information to our partners, suppliers and sub-contractors in order to process your order, fulfil deliveries, compete billing and invoicing transactions and to enable delivery and logistics to be planned and delivered efficiently.
We may supply your personal data to trusted suppliers who undertake analysis for us.
We may also pass your personal data to other third parties (including, without limitation, our Affiliates) if necessary in order to arrange for a booking to be provided or enquiry answered or to process a booking in a way contemplated by our website.
In some cases we may pass information, including your personal data, to third parties outside the European Economic Area. These countries may not provide the same level of protection for your personal data as the UK. If we do transfer your data outside the European Economic Area we will put in place a contract to ensure, so far as reasonably possible, that your information is protected or, where applicable, covered by the US “Safe Harbour Program”.
Consents
By entering your personal data onto our website, you agree to your personal data being processed in these ways. If you are a Renter you agree that you are authorised to disclose to us personal data about your Renter’s Party and that we may use such personal data in the same way as if it were your personal data.
If you have subscribed to our e-mail service or have made a booking for, or an enquiry about, the services we offer, you agree we may send you targeted promotional e-mails about the services and special deals we offer unless you have opted out of receiving these.
You agree that we may also disclose our customer database, including any personal data relating to you contained in it, to a third party who acquires or attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the assets or shares in Clickstay Ltd. or our website whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise.
Updating your personal data
Please ensure that you keep your personal data up to date.
We store details of your personal data and transactional information against your personal profile. We keep your personal data for such periods of time as we consider to be necessary for us to provide our services.
If you post a comment on our website, or send a comment to us by email, text message or phone, or by letter or other means, we may display this content indefinitely in any relevant context. This will be anonymised in the case of testimonials or customer services conversations.
When you give information about another person, you confirm that that person has appointed you to act in that way and to consent to the processing of that person’s personal data, in the ways described above as if it were your personal data including, without limitation, to the transfer of that data outside the European Economic Area.
Disclosure
We may disclose your personal data where we are obliged or permitted by law to do so. If you send offensive messages or objectionable content on or via our website or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on our website, we may use the information that we have about you to stop this behaviour. We may, without limitation, inform law enforcement agencies and (if appropriate) your employer about your behaviour.
Information requests
You are generally entitled to ask us (by letter or e-mail) what details of yours are being held or processed, for what purpose and to whom they may be or have been disclosed. We will provide you with this information free of charge; however we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We promise to respond to your request as soon as possible and at the latest within one month of receipt of your written request. In certain limited circumstances we are entitled to refuse your request – for example if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.
If you believe that any of your personal details which we are processing are inaccurate or incorrect please contact us immediately.
