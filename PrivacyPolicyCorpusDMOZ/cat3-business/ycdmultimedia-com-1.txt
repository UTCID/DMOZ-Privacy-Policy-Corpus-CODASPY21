1. Information We Collect and How We Use It:
YCD will not share, sell, auction off or give away, your personal information to any third party or other organization provided to us through the Site except under this Policy and subject to your consent.
In order to provide our Services, we may collect the following types of information:
• Information You Provide - When you visit the Site and use certain Services we may require you to provide contact information including without limitation: full name, email address, company name, country of origin, etc.
• Personal Information - We process your personal information only for specific and limited purposes, including the provision of the Services. We ask only for personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. Some of these purposes may include to inform you of new services we will be providing, to send you requested product information and promotional material, for marketing purposes and market research, and internally to help us improve our Services and to help resolve any problems.
• User Information - When you use our Services, we may automatically receive and record information from your computer, documents and browser, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes. We also use your IP address to help with server problem diagnosis and to administer our Site. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.
• Anonymous Data Collected Through the Site - In addition to the information we collect as described above, we may use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of the Site. For example, YCD's Web server may automatically log which pages of the Site our visitors view, their IP addresses and which Web browsers the Site's visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables YCD to compile statistics about the Site's visitors and their use of our Services. The Site contains hyperlinks to other pages on YCD's Site. YCD may use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages on the Site our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally – it simply enables YCD to compile statistics about the use of these hyperlinks.
• User Communications - When you send an email or other communication to YCD, YCD may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.
• Cookies - In order to provide certain features and collect the anonymous data, the Site and Services use cookies. A cookie is a small file that a website or application stores on your browser or device and can later read back. Cookies do not damage your computer. YCD's cookies do not contain any private information of the users and said cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. By using the Services you hereby agree to the foregoing use of cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse the cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
• Links - Links to other sites may be provided by YCD as a convenience to our customers. YCD is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This Policy applies solely to information collected by YCD and related to the Site.
• Children - If you are a child under the age of 18, you must obtain parental consent prior to using our Service. YCD will not knowingly contact or engage with children under the age of 18 without said parental consent. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided us with their personal information, please contact us at the address given above and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
