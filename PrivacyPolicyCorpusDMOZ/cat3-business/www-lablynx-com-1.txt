I have worked with LabLynx for about 9 years now. We had to work closely together to have our LIMS programming specialized to fit our processes that were in place. John's team has always been able to get the LIMS to do what we needed it to do, and they have always been there when I have needed them, even during a weekend several times. We recently have decided to move an antiquated spreadsheet inventory system over into LabLynx since most of the pieces are already there. I can't wait to see how much wasted time will be eliminated and how much better information will be available to those who need it daily. Maybe we'll find something else it can do for us in the future.
