Privacy Policy
GENERAL
Tranquilmoney respects the privacy of every individual who visits www.tranquilmoney.com (the "Website"). Tranquilmoney wants you to fully understand what information we gather about you, how that information is collected, and how that information is used and how you can control the collection and/or use of information about you. So, please read this Policy carefully.
PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
There are cases where Tranquilmoney may ask you for personally-identifiable information such as your name, mailing address and email address. We may also collect information from email, letters or other correspondence that you send us. Tranquilmoney will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily, with the exception of your computer's IP address. The IP address is an identifier unique to each computer or internet usage session.
WHEN YOU DO PROVIDE US WITH PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, TRANQUILMONEY MAY
Store and process that information to enhance your experience with Tranquilmoney so that we provide a service that is relevant and easy to use
Use that information to contact you for informational, marketing and promotional purposes on behalf of Tranquilmoney and third parties, including such as welcoming you back to the Web Site or informing you of service enhancements or promotional items
Disclose that information to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Tranquilmoney's rights or property, other users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
Disclose that information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction
In addition, as Tranquilmoney continues to develop its business, we may sell or buy other businesses or assets. A buyer or successor will have access to our customer lists as this information is considered a transferable business asset.
Except as stated in this Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time personally-identifiable information is gathered, we will not provide personally-identifiable information to third parties.
NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Tranquilmoney may also collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information may include your age, gender, interests and preferences and the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to the Web Site. Tranquilmoney may share this information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors or other third parties.

Tranquilmoney, like the operators of many other web sites, uses the cookies to identify you when you visit the Web Site. Tranquilmoney may also use the cookie to recognize you to help ensure the security of confidential information. Tranquilmoney uses the information from cookies to personalize services and determine the amount and type of traffic at the Web Site.

SECURITY
The importance of security of all personally-identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. While we strive to protect your personally-identifiable information, Tranquilmoney can not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our on-line products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
