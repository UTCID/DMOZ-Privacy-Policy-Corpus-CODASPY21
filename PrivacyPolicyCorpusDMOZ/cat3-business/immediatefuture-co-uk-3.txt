We use cookies. Not the delicious kind, but the ones that deliver website functionality, social media features and traffic analytics. By continuing to use the immediate future website, you’re consenting to our cookies. Oh, and if you want you can check out our privacy notice too.
What are these Cookies then?
Cookies are teenie-weeny ‘ickle’ text files sent by our web server to your web browser and are stored by your web browser. They store information, so our website recognises you when you come back. This enables us to identify and track your web browser to deliver a secure and better service – like filling in your forms or remembering your preferences.
They might be small things, but they can store a range of information. Some include personally identifiable bits like name or email. But it can only do so if you’ve shared your data with us in a form. Other than that, we can’t see your computer, or any other files or what you’re wearing! We are just not that creepy.
What types of cookies do we use?
Ooh we’ve a couple of different flavours.
We have session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies have nothing to do with drinking. They are cookies that last for as long as your browser is open. They are deleted the minute you shut down your browser. The persistent ones, do what they say on tin. They last even when you close your browser. They are stored in your computer until deleted or until their individual expiry date.
What on earth do we use them for?
The law says we can store cookies on your device if they are ‘strictly necessary’ for the operation of this site. For all other types of cookies, we need your permission, and these cookies crumble in two ways:
Performance and Analytics
These little cookies collect information about how you use our website.  They’re the cuties that tell us which pages you visit, what blogs you liked (big IF team competition on this one!), and if anything goes wrong. They help us improve the site function and performance.
But they don’t collect any identifiable information unless you give it to us in a form. It’s kept anonymous except for a couple of inferred data points such as location or referrals.
Third-party plug-in cookies
These are cookies that are set by another domain – mainly ad tracking and social media cookies (sometimes referred to as pixels). This little ‘guest’ cookie tell us when a share button is used, or when you visit us from a social or Google advert.
At the end of this policy we’ve listed all the cookies we have – it is not many! We don’t share data from our cookies and we can’t access any personal information from third party cookies.
Bleurg! Don’t want any cookies?
If you don’t want cookies then you can turn them off pretty quickly at a browser level. You can do this for all sites you browse or just us lovely peeps at immediate future.  There is a great guide to turning off cookies, covering most browsers, here.
You can turn off individual cookies from ad networks at https://youronlinechoices.eu/  or www.aboutads.info
Questions, questions, questions
If you have any questions about this Cookie Policy or our treatment of Cookies, drop us a note at Privacy@immediatefuture.co.uk
