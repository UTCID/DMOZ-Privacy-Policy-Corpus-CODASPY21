An important Transaction Reminder about Regulation D
Certain accounts at all financial institutions are affected by the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation D. At All In Federal Credit Union, these accounts are the Savings Accounts, Money Market Accounts and Christmas Club Accounts. (Transactions from All In Credit Union Checking Accounts are NOT limited by this regulation. The limitation does not apply to in-person transfers, ATM transfers or pre-authorized payments to a loan at the same Credit Union. Pursuant to Regulation D, electronic transfers from these Saving Accounts are limited to no more than six per calendar month. This includes transfers caused by overdrafts on your account. If you exceed these limitations, even though there is money in your Savings Account, the transfer will not take place. This can result in fees being imposed and exceeding these Regulation D limitations may cause your account to be closed. Learn More about Regulation D.
