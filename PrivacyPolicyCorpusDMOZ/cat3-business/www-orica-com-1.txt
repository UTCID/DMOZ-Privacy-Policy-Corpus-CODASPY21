Cookie Notice
This cookie notice is for visitors to our website. It sets out what cookies are, and the types and details of cookies we use. It also explains how you can control the cookies that are installed on your device.
In this notice ‘we’ and ‘our’ means Orica Limited and its subsidiaries (Orica) who operate this website.
What are Cookies?
When you access our website, we may send a “cookie”  to your computer which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number which can be stored on your hard drive or other storage device (persistent cookies) or in temporary memory (session cookies). This enables us to recognise your computer each time you visit. While you are visiting an Orica website, we may use cookies to facilitate a more personalised web browsing experience. Information collected by cookies may be classed as personal data.
Types of cookies we use
Persistent cookies remain on a user’s device until manually purged. They identify pages accessed and can provide personalised features, for example, choosing which webpage you would like to make your start page. They are used to help us develop the design and layout of our website, improve applications and measure their effectiveness.
Session cookies are temporary cookies used for security purposes and to maintain the continuity of your browsing session. For example, these cookies allow you to be recognised once you have logged in and move around our website. Session cookies are deleted when you exit your browser.
You can configure your web browser software to reject cookies. However, in that case the full functionality of some parts of our website may not be available.
Third Party Cookies
Some third parties may use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons, Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects also known as “Flash cookies”) and JavaScript on our website, in connection with online services like banner advertising, website analytics, maps, social sharing and surveys. This may allow them to collect information about your use of our website (including your computer’s IP address) which they may store in the United States or other countries.
The use of these technologies allows them to deliver customised advertising content, measure the effectiveness of their advertising, evaluate users’ use of our website and other websites, and provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Those third parties may also transfer the information they collect to others if they are required to do so by law, or where those others process the information on their behalf.
The services we may use from time to time include Google Analytics, AddThis and Microsoft (e.g. ASP.net and Bing Maps). You can find more details in the privacy policies for those services, including information on how to opt-out.
