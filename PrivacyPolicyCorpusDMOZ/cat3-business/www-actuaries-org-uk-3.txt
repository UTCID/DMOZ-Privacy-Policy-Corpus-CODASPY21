Running off the £2 trillion of UK corporate sector defined benefit liabilities in an efficient and effective fashion is the biggest challenge facing the UK pensions industry. Trustees and sponsors overseeing those schemes need to be clear on their target end-state and the associated journey plan – but too few have well articulated and robust plans.
As the halfway point of his tenure as IFoA President approaches, Tan Suee Chieh would like to invite you to his Presidential Update on 12 January 2021 at 08.30am (UTC).
The Presidential Update will allow Suee Chieh to set out his report card of how the last six months have gone - a period which has seen both the IFoA and the profession go through a significant number of changes at a time of real uncertainty and challenge.
The actuarial skill set has much to offer the banking industry. So many of the skills that actuaries acquire during their working life translate across to the world of banking and yet banking is perceived as an alien environment to many actuaries. But is it?
Guaranteed products evolved to address genuine customer needs and wants.  However, they have fallen from favour in the UK market over time (yet still remain popular in some other countries).
The Long-Term Product Guarantees Working Party was established by the Life Board in 2019 to investigate long term guarantees, traditionally available as pension, investment and annuity products in the UK.
Understanding biases in trustee decision making
What is the evidence that “behavioural” factors, such as human psychology, company culture, corporate politics and conflicts of interest, cause institutional investors to deviate from optimal behaviour? Professor Peter Ayton (Leeds University Business School) presents his findings from the first extensive research programme conducted into the decision making processes of pension fund trustees.
This free-to-view webinar for IFoA members is the first in the IFoA’s 2021 series highlighting its commissioned research through its Actuarial Research Centre (ARC) and offers an opportunity to put questions to the panel on the practical implications for actuaries working in investments and other areas.
Covid-19 has required an urgent and cross-practice initiative to facilitate the extensive impact this pandemic has across all industries. IFoA members have been keen to contribute in a different way, so we developed the IFoA Covid-19 Action Taskforce [ICAT] to coordinate our effort, with a more efficient governance.
We have over 500 volunteers and countless topics which we have amalgamated into 93 workstreams.
Drawing from his most recent book “The New Long Life” and his longevity research Andrew J Scott will outline how longer lives and new technologies will fundamentally reshape how we structure our lives and transform the economy. As well as looking at the agenda this will set governments and corporates he will focus on the implications for you and how you prepare your future career.
