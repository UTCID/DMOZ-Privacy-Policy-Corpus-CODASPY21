2. The information we collect about you.
Information we collect.
We obtain information about you and your use of our Services, to develop comprehensive statistics related to the use of our Services, to serve our customers better, and for other business-related purposes. The information we collect can include non-personally identifiable information or personal information as further described herein. Please note that if you fail to provide us the information identified herein, we may not be able to perform functions that would require our access to and use of such information.
Personal information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. We collect information through any correspondence that you provide to us whether through email, mail, phone calls, or through our Services. Information that you provide might include, but is not limited to, the following: (a) first and last names; (b) demographic information; (c) mailing address; (d) email address; (e) phone number; (f) credit card number; (g) job title; (h) company name; and (i) other information that personally identifies you.
We do not consider personal information to include information that can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.
When and how do we collect your information?
We collect information from you both when you provide it voluntarily and also automatically when you use our Services. Most of the personal information we receive relates to Services that you have requested or content you have elected to receive.
In some instances, we automatically collect certain types of information when you use our Services or correspond with us. Automated technologies may include the use of web server logs to collect IP addresses, “cookies” and web beacons.
A “Cookie” is a small data file that is downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you use our Services, used to tailor your use of our Services and your preferences, authenticate your access, and/or display relevant information. An “Anonymous Identifier” is a random string of characters that is used for similar reasons as Cookies. We may use Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers to become more familiar with you through the study of analytics.
Some portions of our Services require the use of Cookies for proper functioning. Anonymous Identifiers can be used where Cookie technology is not available. You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the appropriate “do not track” setting on your web browser. These features are not yet uniform, so we do not currently respond to such features or signals. Therefore, if you select or turn on a “do not track” feature in your web browser or block or delete tracking Cookies, we, and our third-party providers, may continue collecting information about your online activities as described in this Privacy Notice. If you select this setting, you may be unable to access or use certain parts of our Services.
A “Web Beacon” is an object embedded into a web page or an email that collects various data. A Web Beacon functions similarly to a Cookie and can allow us to learn more about your behavior, actions, and preferences. For more information regarding your choices with respect to cookies and other tracking technologies, please see “Your Rights and Options Regarding Your Information” in Section 5 below.
For more information about the information we collect, read on below.
What information do we collect from you?
During the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information that are processed pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”): (a) identifiers, such as your contact information and online account information; (b) Internet and electronic network activity information, including such information as your interactions with the Services and Social Media Platforms (defined below); (c) audio, electronic or visual information; (d) inferences about you, including about your preferences; (e) commercial information including records or products or Services purchased; (f) financial information and other information as described above that may be considered personal information under California Civil Code Section 1798.80; and (g) protected classifications under California or federal law.
For more information about the types of your personal information that we may use and how we use your personal information, see the detailed description below.

Legitimate Business Interests
Where we rely on “legitimate business interests” as the reason for processing your information, we have to carry out a balancing exercise to make sure your rights as an individual are not impacted. In some cases, we have set out our balancing test above. Otherwise, as a result of our balancing test, which is detailed below, we have determined, acting reasonably and considering the circumstances, that we are able to process your personal information in accordance with data protection laws on the basis that we have a legitimate business interest.
We have a legitimate business interest in processing your personal information as:
We need the information to respond to your inquiries;
We need the information to send you information; and
We would be unable to provide our Services without processing your information.
We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal information for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as (a) we process your personal information only so far as is necessary for such purpose and (b) it can be reasonably expected for us to process your personal information in this way. In most cases, the information is being processed for your benefit as well as ours.
If we wish to process your existing information for a new purpose other than as stated above, and you are located in the European Union, California or any other jurisdiction that has passed a similar data privacy law, we must inform you of that further processing and provide information surrounding your information’s use.
4. Who we may share your information with.
We generally do not “sell” personal information for purposes of the CCPA. As set forth in this Privacy Notice, we disclose personal information to third parties that we engage for business purposes, to help us run our business and perform the Services, to assist us with complying with our legal obligations, and for other business purposes described in this Privacy Notice. During the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed each of the categories of personal information listed in Section 2 for such business purposes. In addition, your information may be accessible to third parties with whom you interact or direct us to share your information.
In connection with our Services, we may share your personal information with the following types of recipients and for the following reasons:
Categories of Recipients
