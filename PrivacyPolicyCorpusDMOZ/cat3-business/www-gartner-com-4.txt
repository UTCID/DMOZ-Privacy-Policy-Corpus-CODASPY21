Gartner Policies
Overview
Anti-Bribery Policy (PDF)
The Anti-Bribery Policy establishes our corporate policy and procedures for ensuring compliance with anti-bribery laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, legislation enacted under the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (“OECD Convention”), and similar laws of other countries.
Antitrust Policy (PDF)
Antitrust laws forbid any business practice that reduces competition, either through collusive activity among competitors or through the use of a strong market position to exclude rivals. In the US, these laws are referred to as “Antitrust laws”; outside of the US, they are referred to as “Competition laws”. The Antitrust Policy establishes our corporate policy and procedure for ensuring associates and individuals who participate in Gartner Peer Activities comply with Antitrust and Competition laws in all regions in which the company does business.
Code of Conduct
The Gartner Code of Conduct is the guide for how we expect associates to conduct themselves in dealings with the communities we serve — both outside and inside the company. It incorporates many policies, explaining them in a way that all associates can fully understand and use to make the right decisions in every setting, every day.

Conflict of Interest
Gartner’s reputation for independence and objectivity is one of the company’s most important business assets, and one that Gartner associates are all expected to preserve and protect. Gartner associates are expected to consider the rights, interests and responsibilities of Gartner as well as those outside the company with whom we do business, and to avoid situations in which their own interests actually conflict, or may be seen as conflicting, with those of the company.
