to comply with applicable laws or regulations;to respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;to maintain the security and integrity of the Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; orto protect the rights or property of PRA, including enforcing the terms governing the use of our Services and referring to law enforcement information suggesting that someone is using our Services to participate in illegal activity.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
Our Services use cookies (small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that we put on your computer) and other similar tracking technologies (like web beacons, tags, and scripts) to provide the Services and to help collect information that we use to administer the Services, to analyze your use of the Services, and to assist with our promotional and marketing efforts.
Read More
Cookies
PRA uses cookies—pieces of information that our web server sends to your computer when you access the Services. Cookies may collect information that includes a unique identifier, user preferences, and statistical information about the nature and volume of usage of the Services.
Some features and functions of the Services depend on cookies. If you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to use these features, and preferences that depend on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings, and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
You may manage cookies at any time through your browser settings. To find out how to manage cookies, visit www.aboutcookies.org, then select “How to Control/Delete Cookies” and follow the instructions for your browser or click this: here.
Web Beacons and Analytics Services
The Services may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs or web bugs) that PRA uses to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and analyze the usage of the Services.
The Services may also contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers that help us compile statistics about the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and other operations, or from third party social networks, which enables us to provide social media features and functions for some of our Services. These technologies allow these third parties to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. For example, PRA uses Google Analytics to collect information about the number of visitors to the Services, where they come from, and how they use the Services. We use this information to help us to improve the Services.
Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights
The law may give you certain rights relating to your personal information and our processing of it. Although these rights differ depending upon geography and other circumstances, PRA will honor your rights in compliance with the laws that apply. You may exercise these rights by visiting our privacy rights portal here
and providing the information requested. (NOTE: California residents should click here instead, and read to the “Additional Information for California Residents” section below.) Our privacy team will review your request and respond to you within a reasonable time frame.
Although the specific names given to privacy rights vary from place to place, common types of rights you may have include:
The right to have access to information that we have about you;The right to correct inaccuracies in information that we have about you;The right to withdraw a consent you may have previously given to process information that we have about you;The right to have certain information we have about you deleted from our records;The right to place certain restrictions on the way we process personal information about you; andThe right to object to some kinds of processing of your personal information.
It is important to understand that these rights are not absolute, and that in some cases we will be partially or even completely unable to comply with your request, though in all cases we will comply with the laws that apply. In particular, maintaining the integrity and validity of the clinical trial data is crucial to the success of scientific research, which must be taken into account as we respond to requests.PRA reserves the right not to respond to requests generated through third-party applications or automated processes without direct validation of the requests by data subjects using the resources provided by PRA for the exercise of these rights.
Please be advised that if you are a patient in a clinical trial, PRA has no means by which to identify you and therefore cannot respond to privacy rights request. You should contact the Doctor who is treating you at the clinical trial site for any requests.
Your Communication Preferences
You can opt-out of receiving promotional or marketing communications from us at any time by using the unsubscribe link in the email communications we send. If you or your organization are a PRA client or business partner, we will still send you non-promotional communications, like study-related emails.Where an application that we provide enables you to directly manage your preferences and the personal information you are providing, we will make this readily available to you for you to exercise choice. You can also contact us at any time. The supplemental information notice provided to you for specific Services may provide contact points or instructions on preference election for that Service.
Additional Information for Individuals in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area and Switzerland
Legal Bases for Processing of Personal InformationWe rely on different legal grounds for the processing of your personal information that depend on the context of your interactions with PRA:
We process personal information we collect through the Services for certain legitimate business interests. These legitimate interests relate to conducting and managing our business. When we process personal information for these purposes, we will ensure that we take account of your privacy rights. You can object to this processing using the link in “How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights” (above). Our legitimate business purposes include:
Where processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our Services and communications for the benefit of our users;
Determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising and ensuring communications are relevant to the choices you make; and
to enhance the security of our Services and information systems to maintain the integrity and protection of information they contain.
If we process your personal information under a consent provided by you, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time as set out in the section above “How to Exercise Your Rights.” Your withdrawal of consent, however, will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we have undertaken before the withdrawal.
We may process your personal information where necessary for our compliance with a legal obligation.
Finally, in some cases we process your Personal Information as necessary to perform a contract with you, or to take steps that you request before we enter into that contract.
Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority Under the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act, you have a right to lodge a complaint directly with the country Supervisory Authority responsible for where you live, work or where an alleged infringement has occurred. You may also contact PRA’s Data Protection Officer at PrivacyOfficer@prahs.com if you have any questions or concerns.
Additional Information for Residents of the State of California
This section supplements the remainder of this Privacy Notice and applies solely to residents of the State of California, to the extent the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) applies to PRA’s processing of their personal information (these individuals are referred to in this section as “California Consumers”). As it relates to California Consumers:
The term “personal information,” when used in this Privacy Notice, should be interpreted to have the same meaning as specified in the CCPA. Personal information does not include de-identified or aggregated information, or any other information the CCPA excludes from its scope.
Depending upon the nature of your interaction with PRA, information described in “Why we collect your personal Information” may include data subject to Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80, and information about protected classifications under California or federal law, such as race, age, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, medical condition, disability, citizenship status, and military and veteran status.
"Sale" of data under the CCPA
PRA does not rent or sell your personal information to anyone for monetary compensation. However, as disclosed above, including the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” and “Web Beacons and Analytics” section, PRA does allow certain third parties like Google Analytics to set their own cookies or identifiers that enable them to gather personal information about you. When you first visit our website, you are presented with a choice about whether or not you wish to permit the use of those cookies. If you would prefer not to permit these third-party cookies, you can decline to accept them. If you accept these cookies and later decide you no longer wish to permit them, you can either use the settings in your browser to clear all cookies, or you can click here to change your preferences for our site.
CCPA Rights of California Consumers
In addition to the right to opt out of the sale of information described above, the CCPA provides California Consumers with other rights relating to their personal information. PRA will honor verified requests to exercise those rights, and will not unlawfully deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you a different quality of service for exercising those rights. These rights include:
Accessing Information PRA has collected about youUpon request, PRA will provide California Consumers with information about our collection and use of your personal information over the last 12 months, including categories and specific pieces of personal information PRA has collected about you, our business purpose(s) for collecting them, and the categories of third parties with whom we share them.
Requesting that PRA delete your informationYou may request that PRA delete any personal information it has collected about you. This right is not absolute, however, and under some circumstances PRA may decline to delete your personal information where permitted by the CCPA.
Exercising your CCPA rights
California Consumers can exercise their rights under the CCPA by visiting HERE, or by calling +1 877.202.0559. Regardless of how you make your request, please provide sufficient detail for PRA to properly assess and respond to it. PRA may be unable to respond to incomplete or vague requests.
PRA will require you to verify your identity before proceeding with your request, and will typically require you to provide at least two or three pieces of information that may be used for verification. Information needed to verify identity may vary depending upon your relationship with PRA. If other measures or more information is required, such as the provision of one or more forms of valid government identification, we will contact you and request additional verification.
You may authorize an agent to make a request on your behalf. Any agent making a request on your behalf must indicate that they are acting as your agent or representative and provide the name, email address and description of the agent’s relationship with the individual, and a certification that the agent has permission to submit the request on the individual’s behalf. PRA may require proof of the agent’s authorization, including the written permission of the individual the agent represents, and/or a valid Power of Attorney.
PRA reserves the right not to respond to requests generated through third-party applications or automated processes without direct validation of the requests by data subjects using the resources provided by PRA for the exercise of these rights.
Other Important Information
