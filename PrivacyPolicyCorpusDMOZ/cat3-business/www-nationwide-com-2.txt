The fact that Nationwide authorizes linked websites is not an endorsement, authorization, express or implied sponsorship, or affiliation with respect to linked websites, its owners, sponsors or providers.
Using other aggregation websites
Other companies may offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your financial account information from all of the financial institutions you do business with so that you can view all your account information at one online location. To do this, an aggregation provider may request access to your financial information, usernames and passwords. Before you provide them with this information, you should use caution and ensure that the aggregator company has appropriate privacy and security practices in place to protect the information you provide, or to which they are gaining access.
We’re not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your Site username and password. If you provide your Site username, password or other information about your accounts with us to an aggregation website, we’ll consider that you’ve authorized all transactions or actions initiated by an aggregation website, whether you were aware of a specific transaction or action. If you decide to revoke the authority you’ve given to an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you change your password for the Site to ensure that the aggregation website can no longer access your account.

Where an email address is required to upload Visitor Submissions, you agree to use a valid email address and represent that you’re the individual identified by the address. If you wish to submit materials to the Site, you’re prohibited from impersonating any other individual or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origination of the Visitor Submission.
Visitor Submissions will not be accepted that infringe in any manner on the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or that contain privileged, confidential, proprietary or trade-secret information of any individual or entity, or that may violate the legal rights of any person or entity in any jurisdiction or locale. You may not submit materials that are (or purport to be) the personally identifiable information about others, such as full name, postal address, email address, telephone number or any other personal attribute which would constitute harassment or an invasion of privacy.
Visitor Submissions become the property of Nationwide. You grant Nationwide a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-transferable, sub-licensable and assignable right to use, edit, modify, adapt, translate, edit and reformat Visitor Submissions as necessary, and for any purpose, anywhere in the world, including into those forms that may constitute advertising. If you submit a Visitor Submission, you’re also hereby granting to Nationwide the non-exclusive right to seek enjoinment and possible damages from any third party who otherwise uses Visitor Submissions in an unauthorized way or through unauthorized reproduction of any Visitor Submission.
