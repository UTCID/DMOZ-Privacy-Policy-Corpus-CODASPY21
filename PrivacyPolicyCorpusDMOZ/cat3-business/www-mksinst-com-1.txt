We do not permit our service providers or channel partners to use that personal data except as required to provide the product or service requested by MKS. Such services may include analysis on website usage, trends and traffic, hosting and IT storage services in which we might store submitted contact information (e.g., CRM or ERP systems), marketing vendors that help us to provide you with promotional offers, newsletters and product information, and suppliers of component materials or related services or logistics providers that help us deliver product to you.
Corporate Transactions: We may share your personal data while negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate controls such as a restructuring, merger, acquisition, divestiture, or other sale of our assets.

For example, this may include exchanging information with companies and government agencies for fraud protection, credit risk reduction, or compliance with export control laws. We may also disclose your personal data to respond to requests if we are involved in a legal proceeding.
With your Consent: We also may share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction.
Where personal data is transferred to non-related third parties or any country outside the EU/EEA within the above-mentioned cases, appropriate measures are provided to safeguard such data transfer and data protection clauses are agreed upon by the recipients, the content of which is made available to you upon your request.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity and ensure that your information is used only in connection with legitimate purposes, we have established certain technical, management and operational security controls to safeguard and secure the personal data that we process. We also take steps to safeguard information according to established industry practices and periodically evaluate our current practices against new technologies for methods of protecting information. Some of the specific technical and administrative safeguards that we employ include, but are not limited to, the following:
Personal data that is transmitted to us via our website is stored behind our secure firewalls, which we maintain and update regularly;
We provide access to systems containing personal data on a "need-to-know" basis and only after appropriate authorizations are obtained to ensure that the individual requires access in connection with his or her role;
We deploy technologies that scan for potential viruses and malware for inbound and outbound communications to avoid unauthorized access to our networks and databases;
We evaluate our external vendors from a security perspective and require certain technical thresholds be maintained to the extent that such vendors will have access to or otherwise manage a system or network containing personal data; and
We provide privacy training to individuals within different facets of our organization that access or use personal data in connection with their role.
Where personal data is transferred to non-related third parties or any country outside the EU/EEA within the above mentioned cases, appropriate safeguards are provided to safeguard such data transfer and data protection clauses are agreed upon by the recipients, the content of which is made available to you upon your request.
