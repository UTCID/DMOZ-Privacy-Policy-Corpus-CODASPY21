Privacy Policy
Martin Engineering Company (“Martin Engineering”) is committed to your right to privacy and to keeping your personal information private. Because our website (located at the URL http://www.martin-eng.com) includes areas in which individuals can provide personal  information, we have developed Martin Engineering’s Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and practices regarding information we collect about you on this site.
How we gather information about you
Martin Engineering may collect and maintain certain personal information about you when you register at our website. Martin Engineering will use such information internally and may also share a limited amount of your personal information with any subsidiary, affiliate or third-party vendors that act on our behalf, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

This information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and your domain name. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the ISP through which you access the web and a domain name is the name of the computer itself through which you access the web.
Martin Engineering logs these IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed and various other site statistics.
