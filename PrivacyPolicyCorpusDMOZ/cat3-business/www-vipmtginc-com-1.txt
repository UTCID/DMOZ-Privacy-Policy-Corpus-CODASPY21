Why VIP
VIP is not in the business of simply selling loans. Our passion is being able to outline a path to homeownership for each customer, discovering their goals, and incorporating them into the home loan process. We match our borrowers with the best possible program and product for each of their unique financial situations, focusing on today, tomorrow, and the future.
