Fraud Prevention Services
In our continuing efforts to keep your accounts secure, we’ve improved our alert system for potential fraud.
Here’s how it works:
When potential fraud is detected, you will receive an automatic email notification, with the option to reply with “fraud” or “no fraud.”
One minute after the email, you will receive a text alert, which also has the “fraud” or “no fraud” option.
If there is no response received, you will then receive automatic phone calls to confirm or deny fraud.
The call will also give the option of speaking to a fraud analyst.
Remember—our messages will never ask for your PIN or account number.
Debit Card Protection
