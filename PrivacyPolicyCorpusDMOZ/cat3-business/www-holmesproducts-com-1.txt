Choice of Law
Newell Brands controls and manages this website from its facilities in the State of Florida in the United States of America. Unless otherwise stated, materials and content on this website are presented solely for promoting products and services in the United States
of America.
Information published on this website may contain references to products, programs and services that are not announced or available in your country or region. We make no representation that such information, products, programs or services referenced
on this website are legal, available or appropriate in your country or region. These terms of use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida and the United States of America, without giving effect to any principles
of conflicts of law. THIS PROVISION IS VOID, INAPPLICABLE, AND UNENFORCEABLE WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
Jurisdiction
You and Newell Brands irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Florida in connection with any action arising out of or related to these terms of use or their subject matter. You and Newell Brands waive any objection based on lack of personal

Disputes
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to these to the Terms of Use, this website, or any products or services sold
or distributed by or through this website, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to
the Terms of Use. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we
each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. THIS PROVISION IS VOID, INAPPLICABLE, AND UNENFORCEABLE WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
