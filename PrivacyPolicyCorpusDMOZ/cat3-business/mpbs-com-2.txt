THIRD PARTY SITES
References on www.mpbsonline.com to any names, marks, products, or services of third parties, or links to third-party sites or information are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party, its information, products, or services.
MPBS Industries is not responsible for the content of any third party linked site or any link contained in a linked site.
Your use of a third-party site linked from a MPBS Industries Site is at your own risk and will be governed by such third party's terms and policies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.
ORDER ACCEPTANCE AND BILLING
All billing information provided must be truthful and accurate.
Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information constitutes a breach of this Agreement and may result in order cancellation.
Prior to accepting an order we may also request additional information from you.
We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department.
If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge.
We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order.
MPBS Industries may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card.
This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period.
Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held.
We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the item(s).
You will not be charged for most orders until the order has shipped.
Some other exceptions when you will be charged at the time your order is placed are: (i) orders or preorders paid for with a Gift Card, eGift Card or PayPal account; and (ii) orders paid using the in-store “Cash” payment method.
MPBS Industries reserves the right to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order for any reason.
These restrictions may apply to orders placed by the same account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
We will notify the customer should such limits be applied.
MPBS Industries also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers.
For purposes of this Agreement, reselling shall be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any product(s) from MPBS Industries for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of that same product(s) with a third party.
By purchasing a product from any of our Marketplace Retailers, you acknowledge that all Marketplace orders will be fulfilled by the third party Marketplace Retailer and not MPBS Industries.
The Marketplace Retailer will be responsible for all processing, shipping, returns, and customer service related to your Marketplace order.
Products purchased from a Marketplace Retailer can only be returned to that Marketplace Retailer in accordance with its return policy and cannot be returned to MPBS Industries stores or www.mpbsonline.com.
Each Marketplace Retailer's shipping information, return policy, customer service information, and Marketplace Privacy Policy can be found on that Marketplace Retailer's Retailer Information page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.
PRICING INFORMATION
MPBS Industries cannot confirm the price of an item until after your order is placed.
Pricing errors may occur on the www.mpbsonline.com or through MPBS Industries Marketplace retailers.
MPBS Industries reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from MPBS Industries.
MPBS Industries may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
Pricing for products may be different on the www.mpbsonline.com or from prices available in MPBS Industries stores or on MPBS Industries mobile applications (pricing and availability remain subject to confirmation at checkout for mobile users).
It is important to note the following: (i) our physical stores do not honor Internet prices or competitor advertisements from outside of a physical store’s local trade territory; and (ii) our www.mpbsonline.com e-commerce site does not price match with any other online or offline retailer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.
PROMOTIONAL CODES
Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or discontinue with or without notice.
Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law.
Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise offered.
