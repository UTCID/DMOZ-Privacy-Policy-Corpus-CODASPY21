Terms and Conditions
Introduction
These Terms and Conditions including the Privacy Policy and Return Policy which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein shall be legally binding on all customers who access HalfPriceBanners.com ("Our Website") or otherwise engage in a "Transaction" with us as that term is defined below and shall inure to the benefit of HalfPriceBanners.com, Inc. ("Company") and Company's successors and assigns AND SUPERSEDE AND REPLACE ANY INCONSISTENT STATEMENT IN ANY OF OUR MATERIALS, ADVERTISEMENTS OR WEBSITES.
Definitions
The terms "you" and "your" refer to the person or entity ordering product(s) from the Company, as well as accessing or using Our Websites and providing us with your personal information (collectively hereinafter referred to as “Transaction”).
"We", "our", and "us" refer to Company (through any of its divisions or affiliates) and its employees, agents, members, owners, directors, officers, successors and assigns.
100% Satisfaction Guarantee
We are proud to offer a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Our production process includes our Free Design Services, which includes providing you with a proof. To ensure your 100% satisfaction, we do not produce your order until your proof is approved.
90 Day Warranty
We provide a 90 warranty on all our Standard 13 oz, Heavy Duty 18 oz and Mesh Vinyl Banners. If we determine that a banner has a manufacturing error, we will quickly reprint and ship your product, provide a credit equal to the purchase price of the damaged items or issue a full refund of the purchase price of defective/broken product(s). For more information regarding our 90 Day Warranty, please review our Return Policy.
Lowest Price Guarantee
If you find a lower price for the same order from any of our online national competitors within seven (7) days of placing your order with us, we will match our competitors price.
To qualify, the order must be the same material, quality, size and finishing and you must include written documentation of such competitor's offer.
Free Design Services
100% of orders submitted through Our Website have their layouts reviewed for FREE by one of our designers. Once reviewed, we will share a digital proof with you by sending you an email with a link to your proof on Our Website.
Please take time to review the proof and provide feedback to our designers regarding any misspellings, mistakes or design changes.
After receiving any feedback, our designers will share a new digital proof with you.
Once you are satisfied with your proof, please accept the proof by accepting it (A) on Our Website and/or (B) via email. Approvals are not accepted via telephone.
If you do not approve your proof within two weeks, we will cancel your order and refund your order.
Once you have approved a proof, we are no longer liable for any misspelling or mistakes.
Any additional change requests after this point may include additional costs and, in some cases, may not be possible without producing an additional order at your expense.
In some cases, you may request additional design services (like hard copy proofs) that are in excess to our normal free design services.
In those instances, we will make you aware of additional design charges that may be necessary. All additional design work must be approved by you in advance. If you would like additional information regarding additional design services please speak with your Designer.
Production Timing
Standard orders approved before 5:00pm CST (Mon-Fri) will be sent to production the same day (excluding holidays). Standard orders approved after 5:00pm CST (Mon-Fri) will be sent to production the following business day (excluding holidays and weekends). Non-standard orders (Large Format, Fabric, Flags, Table Throws or orders over 300 square feet) must be approved by 1:00pm CST to be sent to production the same day (excluding holidays).
Some large orders or special requests may require additional time in production.
If you have a tight deadline, we provide rush handling and services for an additional fee. Please call Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 to discuss your deadlines.
Refunds
Orders cancelled prior to proof approval are entitled to a full refund.
Refunds will be processed within three (3) business days of your cancellation. Please review our Return Policy for additional information.
If you requested, and we performed, any additional services which included additional charges prior to your cancellation, these costs will be deducted from your refund.
Color Matching
We use standard industry software for designing and printing purposes. We do not guarantee any color matching or exact color print without you requesting our Color Match Services prior to proof approval.
Color Match Services are not available on all products and may require additional costs. If you are interested in using our Color Match Services please call Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 and make a note in the order comments box and provide a Solid Coated Pantone color.
Otherwise, slight color variations are possible and should be considered as acceptable and will not be considered a production mistake and will not be eligible for refund or return or re production. We use best judgment to match color but if you need to visually match color, we recommend ordering sample product by calling Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 and requesting our Color Match Service.
Shipping
Unless otherwise noted, all our products are shipped from our Kansas and Missouri facilities in the United States.
If you have a deadline, you may request expedited shipping by calling Customer Service at (866) 527-1363.
Expedited handling may require additional fees.
The turnaround maps on Our Website show the estimated time from proof approval to delivery with Ground Shipping. These dates are indicative dates only and are based on production ready orders and don't include any public holidays or shipping delays. Any shipping delays need to be directly addressed with the shipping company.
Our orders are shipped using UPS. Shipping prices are determined by the weight of the package and the destination. Additional shipping charges apply to large orders and over-sized packages. Due to UPS shipping restrictions, some banners will need to be folded for shipping. UPS will not provide shipping refunds for packages delayed due to weather or if banners larger than 5’ tall are delayed.
If you have questions about your shipping, please by call Customer Service at (866) 527-1363.
Please note that UPS does not deliver ground packages on Saturday or Sunday. If you need a package delivered on Saturday, please contact Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 for more information. If you are located outside of the Continental United States, please contact Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 for a custom shipping quote.
If your package is lost and the shipping company confirms the loss, we will replace your order free of charge.
This can take up to eight (8) business days after the initial lost order inquiry with us. If UPS, or any other shipping company, has a delay in the delivery of your package we will not be liable and will not refund the order. If you believe your package is lost, please contact Customer Service at (866) 527-1363 as soon as possible.
Damaged Packages
If you receive merchandise that is defective or damaged, please notify us immediately by calling Customer Service at (866) 527-1363.
If we determine, in our sole discretion, that we are at fault, we will replace your order and ship it back to you free of charge.
Please review our Return Policy for additional information.

Standard packages are insured by the shipping company up to $100.
For orders over $500, the Company will pay to insure your package.

We will file a claim with the shipping company and a solution may take up to eight (8) business days to resolve.
