GDPR: DATA PRIVACY NOTICE
Introduction
Borkowski Limited ("We") is a public relations business. We understand that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your personal data is used.  We respect and value the privacy of the individuals whom we process personal information, including our employees, clients, journalists and visitors to our website.  We will only collect and use personal data in a way that is consistent with our obligations and individual rights under the law.
This privacy notice explains how we use and treat any personal data we collect.
The rules on processing of personal data are set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).
What is personal data?
Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.
Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but also covers personal data you voluntarily provide to us [and less obvious online identifiers, such IP addresses and cookies].
Special categories personal data - The GDPR refers to sensitive personal data as ‘special categories of personal data’. The special categories of personal data specifically include genetic data, and biometric data where processed to uniquely identify an individual. Other examples include racial and ethnic origin; political opinion;, religious or philosophical beliefs; health data, sexual life or sexual orientation, trade union membership; and criminal records.
If you choose to provide special categories of personal data to us for any reason, the act of doing so constitutes your explicit consent, where such consent is necessary and valid under your local law, for us to collect and use that data in the ways described in this Notice or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this data.

Your personal data will be treated as strictly confidential.  At times it may be necessary to share personal data with  certain trusted third parties in accordance with contractual arrangements in place with them, including:
Our professional advisers, auditors and insurers;
Suppliers to whom we outsource certain support services such as photocopying and document review;

Most of the personal data we collect and use for marketing purposes relates to individual employees of our clients and other companies with which we have an existing business relationship. We may also obtain contact information from public sources, including content made public at social media websites, to make an initial contact with a relevant individual at a client or other company.
Where we are legally required to obtain your explicit consent to provide you with marketing materials, we will only provide you with such marketing materials if you have provided consent for us to do so. We may send you further emails prompting you to refresh your consent from time to time.
You can exercise your right to prevent marketing communications to you by utilizing opt-out mechanisms in emails we send to you, or emailing cookies@borkowski.co.uk directly.
You can also exercise the right to discontinue marketing communications to you. In such cases, we will retain minimum personal data to note that you opted out in order to avoid contacting you again. If you have agreed to receive marketing but then later change your mind and no longer wish to receive marketing, please let us know so we can remove you from our distribution lists.
Our customer relationship management (CRM) database includes personal data and business information, such as: contact data, publicly available information (e.g. published articles, press releases, public posts on social media sites if relevant for business purpose), your responses to targeted email (including web activity following links from our emails), and other business information included by Borkowski personnel based on their personal interactions with you.
Please contact us at hello@borkowski.co.uk if you do not wish to receive communications from us or wish to be removed from our internal CRM databases.
If you decide to unsubscribe from a service or communication, we will try to remove your data promptly, although we may require additional information before we can process your request.
When we keep your personal data, we are responsible for keeping an accurate record of the data that you have submitted to us and verified.  We do not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of your personal data.
