2. Cookies and Other Technologies
2.1 What is a “Cookie”?
A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can help a website like ours recognize repeat users and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. For more details on cookies and similar technologies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
2.2 Different Durations of Cookies
Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. “Session cookies” only last for as long as the browser session and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.
2.3 First Party and Third Party Cookies
First party cookies are placed on a website directly by the owner of the site, in this case, W-Systems. Third party cookies are placed on a website by third party providers (for example, by companies that provide advertising tracking or web analytics services) and by advertisers on the website. We use both first-party cookies as well as third-party cookies, as described below.
2.4 Pixel Tags
We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the third parties described below, to get information about your usage of the Site and about your interaction with email or other communications. Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message.
