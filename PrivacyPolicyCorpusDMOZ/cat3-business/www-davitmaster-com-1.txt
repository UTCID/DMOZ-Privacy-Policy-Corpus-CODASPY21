Davit Master Customers,
Thank you for your continued support as we move into our 43rd year of business. The health of our customers as well as of our employees is of utmost importance to us, so with the spread of the coronavirus we have decided to modify our business practices going forward. While we are open and continuing manufacturing, to remain compliant we are closing our front office to walk in customers. If you have any questions please give us a call first and we will determine the safest way to support you and get you what you need. This is a time that calls for flexibility and creative thinking, do not hesitate to mention any concerns you have that we may be able to accommodate (i.e. payment over the phone verses in-person). We remain committed as ever to supplying quality Davit Master Corporation products, and are grateful for the opportunity to continue serving our community. May you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy through this trying time.
-The Davit Master Team
