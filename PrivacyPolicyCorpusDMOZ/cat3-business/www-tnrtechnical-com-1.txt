"Battery store impressed me the most. The site was easy to navigate and I received constant updates as to my order. GREAT SERVICE and a GREAT product....
"
– Tom, Well Made
"Thank you!
Not only for the fast turn-around on this quotation, but also for taking the time to read the request, something most suppliers neglect to do.
It was a VERY pleasant surprise to see the included MSDS, reference to the shelf life requirement, as well as the mercury free statement.
Thank you for the conscientious quotation.
"
– Karl Doiron, President
"In 2013, TNR Technical has successfully demonstrated its commitment to excellence with 100% on time delivery and quality of their products to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Your ability, workmanship and superior standard of performance have been instrumental in supporting the commitments of Lockheed Martin to its customers. "
– Tom Simmons, Supply Chain Management, Alex Eksir, Quality & Mission Success
"I am very impressed with the swiftness that I received this order. I ordered them yesterday at 1440 est with the scheduled 3 day delivery option. I received them today by 1000 est, much to my surprise. I didn't expect them until next Monday.
Please know, that is how you attract and maintain a customer base. I will gladly order from your company in the future and will pass on your contact information to my fellow co-workers and constituents."
– Darrell, Senior Pipeline Operator
"I love working with you (TNR) because you always point out your concerns, and provide options!! I am especially wary of battery quality issues as our customers are huge on safety and you probably know how often a leaking battery can be a critical failure for so many reasons! I will offer all the information and disclose the quality concerns and try to sell them on the name brand product."
– Jill, Supplier Manager
