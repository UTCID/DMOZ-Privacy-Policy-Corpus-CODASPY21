Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

“I just wanted to thank you for all your efforts for a great Annual Conference for ESPA.
It was truly one of the best I have attended in terms of content, logistics, networking, local hosting, etc! There were so many top-level speakers that were engaging with timely content.
I thought the leadership track was great and something the organization has needed for a long time.
Thanks for all you do to make ESPA so great!
How many associations can claim that nearly 2/3 of their membership attends the Annual Conference?!?
Great job!”
Julie Pingston, CDME, CMP, CTA Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Greater Lansing Convention & Visitors Bureau
“On behalf of IMARK Group and myself, I’d like to thank each of you for your contributions to IMARK Now magazine. Our magazine speaks volumes about the quality of our organization, our members, and our suppliers. Because this is such an important part of our brand, we set a very high standard of excellence. With your leadership and support, we believe we met that standard. We receive many positive comments on our magazine and that makes us feel great.”
Steve Ruane IMARK Group
“I have never been the Chairperson of such an event before and it was made so much easier with all of the preparation and assistance provided by ICMA [CMA] staff. The recruiting and vetting of speakers, all of the logistics of the venue, the preparation of the “script” were all first rate! All this effort created a dynamic event that I think is just the start of a great new membership opportunity for ICMA. I really enjoyed working with all of you on this! You have built a really great organization and I’m proud to be just a small part of it!”
Dave Tushie ICMA Standards Representative and President of Magellan Consulting
“The outcome was even better than expected. Not only the name, MIDJersey Chamber of Commerce, was WOW, but the roll out was superb. And it continues as we re-named our Award winning Business Magazine, Mercer Business to MIDJersey Business. The response has been wonderful.”
Timothy Losch Past Chairman, Board of Directors, MIDJersey Chamber of Commerce
CMA has consistently provided excellent customer service and has followed up and communicated well at every step of our involvement with them.  Their work has been creative and efficient, and we have used them for multiple projects over the last few years.  I can easily recommend them and we intend to continue to use them ourselves.
