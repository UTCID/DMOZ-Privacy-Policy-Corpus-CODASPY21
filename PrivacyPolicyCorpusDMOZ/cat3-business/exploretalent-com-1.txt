Explore Talent Privacy Policy   Kids Privacy Policy
We at ExploreTalent.com, ("we" or " ExploreTalent.com") have created this
privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal
information and informing you about our practices. This privacy policy
only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage and gather
data on the ExploreTalent.com Website, ExploreTalent.com email communications
between ExploreTalent.com members (collectively, the "Site") but does not
apply to any other Website or offline point of contact between ExploreTalent.com,
or any other company, and consumers. Please review this privacy policy
periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy
was last revised on December 14, 2011. Each time you visit the Site or
provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices
described in this privacy policy at that time.
Your IP Address
Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you visit the Site, we automatically
collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order
to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with
our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad
demographic information about you.
Cookies
Like most Websites, the Site uses cookies to keep track of your purchases
and other activity on the Site and enhance your experience on the Site.
We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save
your password, and if you choose, to save other personal and financial
information so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit the Site.
If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar
on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to
disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the Site.
Information We Collect From You
In order to operate the Site and to provide you with information about
products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect "personal
information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly
(without using the Site) such as full name, postal address, phone number
or email address), "financial information" (i.e. credit card numbers or
passwords) or "demographic information" (i.e. information that you submit,
or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor financial
information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal
code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, purchase history information,
browsing history information, searching history information, registration
history information, and the content of communications between you and
other members over the Site), subject to the rest of this paragraph. Demographic
information is divided into two categories: 1) "non-public information",
which consists of purchase history information and one-on-one communications
between you and other users of the Site; and 2) "public information", which
consists of all other demographic information. We ask that you do not enter
personal information or financial information into your "Profile" (for
example, don't use your address or passcode as your username, or include
your name or address in your written responses), because if you do then
it may be posted publicly on the Site, and the information will then be
treated as "demographic information" that is "public information."
Information Other Websites Collect From You
On the Site, we place links to other Websites operated by other parties.
Some of these other Websites contain our brand names and trademarks and
other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click
on these links and visit these other Websites, regardless of whether or
not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property,
you need to be aware that we do not control these other Websites or these
other Websites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not
apply to these other Websites. Consequently, the operators of these other
Websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may
use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it
were collected on the Site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies
and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13
If you are a child under the age of 13, your profile must be created by a legal guardian. No one under age 13 may provide any Information to or through the Services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any Information on the Services or on or through any of its features/register on the Services, make any purchases through the Services, use any of the interactive or public comment features of the Services or provide any information about yourself to us.
How We Use Personal Information
We use your email address and your other personal information to help
us efficiently operate the Site, to contact you in connection with your
transactions and other activities on the Site (including, but not limited
to, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship
with ExploreTalent.com), and to forward messages to you from other ExploreTalent.com
users. These types of communications are known as "Operational Communications."
In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages,
such as banner ads and special offers.
We also use personal information to send you newsletters, information,
offers and other promotional materials for ExploreTalent.com's or third
parties' goods or services. We attempt to send you offers that are of value
to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information.
The Site provides you with options to decline to receive communications
from ExploreTalent.com (other than those contained in Operational Communications).
Some of these options may only be for a certain category of communications;
others may be more general. By posting a profile on the Site, you are opting
in to receive the ExploreTalent.com by Mail email. To stop receiving ExploreTalent.com
by Mail and stop all automatic notifications login to your Explore Talent
Account go "My Account" > "My Contact Info", check the checkbox "Yes, I
do not want to recieve any automatic notifications" and click "Update"
To operate the Site, including processing your transactions and supporting
your activities on the Site, we may share your personal information with
our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they
can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card
transactions, email origination, receipt or support services, customer
relationship management services, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and
promotional fulfillment. We require these entities not to use your information
for any other purpose.
How We Use Financial Information
We use your financial information to check your qualifications, to bill
you for products and services and to enable you to participate in discount,
rebate and similar programs in which you may elect to participate. By making
a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that
uses your financial information on the Site, you consent to our providing
your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties
as we determine are necessary to support and process your activities and
transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes.
These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions
used to process and support the transaction or activity. By purchasing,
or registering or making reservations for products or services of third
parties offered on the Site, or by participating in programs offered on
the Site that are administered by third parties and that require you to
submit financial information in order to use them, you also consent to
our providing your financial information to those third parties.
How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information
We may review all demographic information. We may use public information
to enable other users to find your profile, to determine whether they are
a match for you and to communicate with you. We may use demographic information
to tailor the Site and communications to your interests.
The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse
and alteration of the information under our control. Our secure server
software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available
today for secure commerce transactions. We encrypt all of your personal
and financial information as it travels over the Internet and we store
your financial information on our servers in encrypted form. Your information
may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be
located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction
in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer
networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws
in your country or jurisdiction.
Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information
If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information
in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we
will notify users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on
the Site. Please note that we will continue to have the right to change
our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable
information, without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this
Privacy Policy, provided that such changes shall only apply to information
gathered on or after the date of the change.
How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information
and Public Information
We give you the opportunity to opt-out of certain communications and modify personal
information or demographic information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic
information from, or make demographic information visible to, the public users of the Site,
at anytime by going to the Account Settings or My Profile section of the Site.
Please be aware that it may take several hours for the changes you make to take effect on
the public areas of the Site. We thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or
deleting your information through the "Account Settings" or "My Profile" section of the Site,
or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from ExploreTalent.com,
will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities on the
Site and for managing future communications from ExploreTalent.com. These changes and deletions
will not change or delete emails or information that we may have already forwarded to other
users or credit card companies or any other third parties, all as provided above in this
privacy policy.
