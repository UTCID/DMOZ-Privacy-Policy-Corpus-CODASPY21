If you are eligible for federal interest subsidy, the interest may be paid by the federal government during this period.
In case your loan does not qualify for the federal interest subsidy, or if your loan is in forbearance, the unpaid interest amount that accrues while you are not making payments will be added to your loan balance.
To limit the growth of your loan balance, you can make some payments toward the accrued interest even when they are not required.
