This is information that is not collected to be associated with identified interested parties but which, by its very nature, could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow users to be identified.
This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the website, the addresses in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) notation of the requested resources, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (success, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and to the user’s IT environment.

Cookies
Our website uses cookies. By browsing our websites and accepting the terms of this disclaimer, you are consenting to the use of cookies in accordance with the terms and conditions of the information itself.
What are cookies
Cookies are small data files that the websites visited by the user send to their terminal or device, where they can be deleted at the end of each work session or stored to be re-transmitted to the same websites upon subsequent visit of the same user. Cookies allow a website to recognise the user’s device, to track their browsing through the different pages of the website and to identify users who visit the website again.
There are different types of cookies:
Technical cookies that include:
Browsing and session cookies that guarantee normal browsing on the website (e.g. they allow authentication for access to restricted areas);
Functionality cookies that make browsing easier for the user by storing the choices made, e.g. language chosen);
Analytical cookies that are used to process aggregate statistical analysis on how users browse the website, the number of pages visited, the number of clicks made on a page, etc.
Profiling cookies that allow the creation of profiles related to the tastes, choices and propensities expressed by the user during browsing and which are subsequently used to send advertising messages in line with their preferences.
The profiling cookies used on this website are exclusively those of third parties
Third-Party Cookies
In the course of browsing the website, users may receive cookies from different websites or from web servers (so-called “third-party” cookies) on their terminals: this happens because the website may contain elements such as, for example, images, maps, sounds and specific links to web pages of other domains that reside on servers other than the one on which the requested page is located. In other words, these cookies are set directly by managers of websites or servers other than those of the website.
These cookies can be sent to the user’s browser by third-party companies directly from their websites which can be accessed by browsing from the Foodlab Website. In such cases, Foodlab is not involved in the operation of these cookies, the sending of which is the responsibility of such third-party companies. This is in fact clarified by the Privacy Guarantor: “The obligation to inform the user about the use of cookies and to possibly acquire prior consent lies with the operator of the website that uses them, as the data controller. If a website also allows the transmission of “third-party” cookies, the information and the acquisition of consent are normally the responsibility of the third party. The user must be adequately informed, albeit with the simplified procedures provided for by law, when accessing the website that allows the storage of third-party cookies, or when accessing the contents provided by third parties and in any event before cookies are downloaded onto their terminal”.
Precisely for the purpose of transparency of the information requested from the operators of the “first-party website” (i.e. the website as managed by Foodlab”) where “third-party cookies” operate, we inform you that the following third-party cookies are operational on the website:

With the CDR system, you can perform your tests in total autonomy Neither skilled staff nor a dedicated external laboratory is needed to use our systems. CDR FoodLab® optimizes
traditional testing methods, making them faster and easier, while guaranteeing accuracy standards in line with
the reference methods.
Analytical kit
CDR FoodLab® Analysis Systems use disposable pre-vialed reagents specifically developed by the research
laboratories of CDR. The use of pre-vialed reagents and the analytical procedures allow:
a sample preparation that is quick and easy, when needed at all;
making analytical procedures extremely fast and easy;
removing all needs for complex calibration procedures.
Reagents come in aluminum packages containing
10 test tubes each to perform 10 tests (or packages for 100
tests containing 10 single packages of 10 test tubes each).
Just a few steps and results are yielded right away Just a few steps will suffice to carry out your analysis in a rapid way in total autonomy. The system is composed
of both the analyzer based on photometric technology and a kit of low toxicity, pre-vialed reagents, developed by
CDR.
CDR FoodLab® is cost-effective because it does not require the use of expensive equipment and does not
entail maintenance, assistance or calibration costs.
