Tax Debt Resolution Each individual’s financial circumstances are unique and individual results will vary based on circumstances, including your ability to provide Liberty Tax® Debt Resolution with information that is accurate and timely. We do not guarantee that your tax debts will be lowered by a specific amount or percentage, that your tax debt will be paid off within a specific period of time or guarantee you will qualify for any IRS programs. Penalties and interest will continue to accrue until your tax liability is paid in full to the IRS. Liberty Tax® Debt Resolution is a tax resolution firm independent from the IRS. We do not assume tax debt, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice. We have affiliate companies that provide credit repair and tax services and we may refer you to them as necessary. Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment, including potential adverse impact on credit rating. Not available in all states.
Easy Advance An Easy Advance is a loan secured by and paid back with your tax refund and is offered by Republic Bank & Trust Company, member FDIC, to eligible taxpayers. Loan amount options are based on your expected Federal refund less authorized fees. If approved for an Easy Advance, a Finance Charge may apply depending on your loan amount.  Loan is subject to underwriting and approval. Easy Advance proceeds are typically available within 24 hours of IRS acceptance of tax return or within 24 hours for those filing before the IRS start date however, if direct deposit is selected it may take additional time for your financial institution to post the funds to your account.
