Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Macpac has been in business for over 40 years and we have always had a 100% commitment
to honest, open and fair dealings in everything we do. Macpac takes its obligations
in relation to the privacy of your personal information seriously and is committed

you sign up for the Macpac Club, enter a Macpac promotion, event or competition,
or purchase a Macpac Gift Voucher, you agree to accept and will be bound by this
Privacy Policy.
We may collect personal information about you from a third party or publicly available

other information you supply to us.
Macpac also operates CCTV cameras in its stores and collects security footage
to assist Macpac to ensure the safety and security of its staff, customers, members
of the public and its product. See below under Video Surveillance.
If you are a candidate for employment, we may collect other information as set
out in our application forms or through the recruitment process, including information
related to your employment history, worker eligibility and referee details.
Use of Personal Information
Macpac uses your personal information for a variety of purposes, including:
to provide and market our business and products to you, whether directly or through
third party websites;
to communicate with you, including sending you promotional material or information
about Macpac and inviting you to participate in competitions, events or research;
to identify when, how and on which subjects you want to communicate with Macpac
and to consider what products and/or services related to these products you might
be interested in;

partnering with;

for any other purpose we advise to you at the time we collect your personal information
or to which you subsequently agree.
How will Macpac contact you?
Macpac may use a number of ways of contacting you, including SMS, mail, digital
messaging, telephone or email. We want to communicate with you only if you want
to hear from us. Should you not wish to receive any of these types of communication
from Macpac, you can update your preferences, including to unsubscribe from communications,
at any time.
Disclosure and storage of personal information
Any personal information you provide is collected and managed by Macpac. We understand
the trust you place in us, and the importance of your personal information and
we have appropriate procedures in place to safeguard and secure the information
we collect to prevent unauthorised use or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and
ensure appropriate use of information.
Personal details will only be used by Macpac and will not be sold to any third
party at any stage. We may disclose personal information to third party service
providers, contractors or within the Super Retail Group of companies of which Macpac
is a part.
If we provide personal information to our contracted service providers or suppliers
we require those suppliers to preserve the confidential nature of such information
and agree to use that information only to fulfil that purpose on our behalf and
for the purpose for which it was provided, and not to retain the details once that
purpose has been fulfilled. If we disclose your personal information to someone
overseas, they are likely to be located in Australia.
How to update your information & unsubscribe
Macpac endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate,
complete and up-to-date. Macpac encourages you to contact us to update any personal
information held by Macpac about you. You can seek access to your personal information
at any time, and we will provide you with that information unless we are prevented
by law from giving it to you. You can seek to correct your details held by Macpac
by contacting Macpac's Privacy Officer. We are committed to dealing with all queries
in a prompt, professional and open manner.
If you subscribe to a mailing list that we maintain, you can ask us to remove
you from that list at any time by using the unsubscribe facility, or sending us
an e-mail with your details to info@macpac.co.nz.
We will comply with that request as soon as we reasonably can. However you understand
that sometimes we may have begun distributing a mail-out before we can process
that request, and in those circumstances you might still receive that mail-out.
Cookies and web monitoring
Macpac uses cookies on our websites and may from time to time also use third parties
to analyse traffic on our websites. Those cookies may be used by other third party
websites when marketing to you. Cookies are pieces of information shared between
your web browser and a website. Use of cookies enables a faster and easier experience
for the user. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information

you to disable or reject the use of cookies. If you disable or reject the use of
cookies some functionality on our websites may not be available or it may take
longer to use that functionality.
Macpac may also use software to broadly locate you in the correct part of the
world or within a geographic range of a transmitting device so we may deliver information
on Macpac products and services relevant to your country, geographic location or
part of the world.
Macpac may also use technology to alert it when you open an email from Macpac
or visit parts of our websites. You can modify your email notification preferences
by clicking the appropriate link included in the footer of the email notifications
if you do not wish this to occur.
Social media and other third party websites
Macpac uses a number of social media services and/or platforms including Twitter,
Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Facebook. These services may be linked
to our websites through the use of social media buttons. Your use of these third
party services in relation to Macpac is entirely optional.
By opting to "follow", "friend", "like" or associate yourself with Macpac on any
of our social media platforms, you agree to accept and be bound by this Privacy
Policy. Macpac may make use of any information that you make public when you use
any such third party services or social media platforms for the purposes set out
in this Privacy Policy. Such information available for use by Macpac includes (but
is not limited to):

re-tweeting anything from our Macpac Twitter account.
If you have accessed other third party websites through our websites and if the
operators of those third party websites collect information about you, we may also
collect, have or purchase access to that information as part of our arrangements
with those third parties.
Where you access a third party website from our websites, cookie information,
information about your preferences or other information you have provided may be
shared between us and the third party based on an arrangement that Macpac has with
those third parties. You usually cannot be identified from the information that
is shared. If you can be identified from this information, we will seek your consent
before sharing the information.
Macpac may also use payment services provided by third parties necessary to provide
you with our products and services.
Third party websites should contain their own privacy statements. Macpac is not
responsible for the services provided by the operators of those third party websites.
If you do not want to provide personal information to any of those third parties,
or make information publicly available, you should not use their particular service.

Video Surveillance
At Macpac we operate Video Surveillance cameras in our stores and other premises
which we use to help preserve the safety and security of our staff, customers,
members of the public and our Macpac product. Here we outline why we operate video
surveillance, including the audio captured as part of that surveillance, how the
images and audio will be used, who is responsible for the system and access to
that information.
This covers the use of all types of video surveillance and audio surveillance
including public and non-public areas and outlines how we will protect the privacy
of individuals and comply with our obligations under privacy legislation.
What is video surveillance?
Video Surveillance is the use of digital camera systems (CCTV systems) that capture
digital footage as well as some audio of individuals and information relating to
individuals on Macpac premises. Our system is based on internet protocol (IP) cameras
that are linked to our Virtual Private Network (VPN). They are not monitored by
any outside organisation.
Why does Macpac operate a video surveillance system?
Macpac has installed a Video Surveillance system within its business operations
to help preserve the safety and security of our customers, our staff and members
of the public as well as detecting and preventing theft. It is also used to allow
a quick response to an incident or emergency situation and for internal training
purposes.
Who is responsible for video surveillance by Macpac?
The Macpac Loss Prevention Manager is responsible for Video Surveillance within
our business. In particular they will configure and oversee its operation, the
guidelines below and Macpac’s internal operating procedures. The Loss Prevention
Manager will also respond to enquiries from the public and employees and train
authorised staff in its use to appropriate levels.
Macpac guidelines for use of video surveillance footage
Macpac has internal procedures to govern the use and care of Video Surveillance
footage. The procedures include that:
all care will be taken to check Video Surveillance footage, images and audio are
accurate, complete, relevant and not misleading before they are used;
information collected by Video Surveillance including audio surveillance will
only be used or disclosed for the purposes for which they were collected and in
accordance with applicable privacy legislation;
the placement of any and all Video Surveillance equipment will not unreasonably
intrude on the privacy of individuals.
When does video surveillance operate and who will monitor it?
Video Surveillance is recorded 24 hours per day in all locations. This is to ensure
any possible criminal or non-compliant behaviour or activity can be recorded, whether
within ‘normal’ business hours or not.
The cameras will be monitored by the Loss Prevention Manager or any senior authorised
staff member. Images and footage can be accessed remotely via secure password protected
applications across the company network at any time. No outside agencies, including
the camera equipment suppliers or contractor/installers can access our system without
the knowledge of the business.
Where will the cameras be positioned?
The Loss Prevention Manager will determine the most effective placement of the
cameras to meet their purposes. Cameras will not be placed in areas that compromise
personal privacy such as change rooms or toilets.
How long will video surveillance images or recordings be held?
Video Surveillance is retained for a maximum of 12 months whereupon it is securely
deleted. However, permanent records of specific events such as theft or criminal
activity will be kept securely on servers at the Macpac Head Office.
Will video surveillance footage or recordings be given to anyone outside the company?
The Loss Prevention Manager will allow access only of relevant images or footage
to:
authorised staff at Macpac;
Macpac’s legal representatives;
contractors specifically authorised to work on the Video Surveillance equipment;
the Police or other public sector agency required to uphold or comply with the
law;
individuals who have formally requested information, at the authorisation and
direction of the Loss Prevention Manager, and within 20 days of the request.
A formal written request may be made by an individual to view footage related
to them. Any such request will be limited by the ease of access to the footage/recordings
and by the need to protect other people’s privacy. If a request is unable
to be granted without unreasonably breaching others’ privacy, a written description
may be provided of what they are doing in the footage/recordings. Any such request
will be responded to within 20 working days.
Privacy policy changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do so, changes to
the Privacy Policy will be effective immediately. The most current version of this
Privacy Policy is located on our websites. We encourage you to check this page
regularly to take notice of any changes we have made to this Policy.
Complaints and contact information
If you believe we have breached your privacy rights in any way, or you would like
to discuss any issues about our Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Officer
at privacy@macpac.co.nz or
