Protection of Personal Information.
The following ten interrelated privacy principles are specified in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and form the basis of the Code:
Accountability – City Savings & Credit Union is responsible for personal information under its control and shall designate a Privacy Officer who is accountable for City Savings & Credit Union’s compliance with the principles of the Code.
Identifying Purposes – The purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified by City Savings & Credit Union at or before the time the information is collected.
Consent – The knowledge and consent of the member are required for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, except in specific circumstances as described within this Code.
Limiting Collection – The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by City Savings & Credit Union. Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means.
Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention – Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the member or as required by law.

Accuracy – Personal information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.
