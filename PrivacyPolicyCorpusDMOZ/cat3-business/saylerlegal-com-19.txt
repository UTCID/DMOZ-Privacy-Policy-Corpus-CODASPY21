Process Serving
Process Serving Services
Our Process Serving Division serves people promptly, and Proofs of Service are generated quickly. Servers will verify addresses by checking with neighbors and we utilize other resources, including the U.S. postal service. Private investigators can be contracted to assist with your needs. Status reports are emailed to keep you advised of our progress. Our automated system will let you know when your service has been completed, and your Proof of Service will be emailed once it has been prepared and signed. You may also obtain a login to our portal to review order history and the status of in-progress orders.
Helpful Information
If known, please provide us with a physical description (including approximate age) of the person to be served, especially in cases where there is a “junior” and “senior” living at the same address.
If the subject is known to be violent, please include this information and the details. Upon review, we may request that you refer the service to the Sheriff’s office.
If known, provide the name of the business where we are attempting service and the hours defendant might be found there.
