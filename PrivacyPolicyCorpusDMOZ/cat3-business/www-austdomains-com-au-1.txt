Domain Privacy
Why is my information public?
ICANN, the international governing body for domain names, requires every domain registrar to maintain a publicly viewable "WHOIS" database that displays personal contact information (including home addresses and phone numbers) for every registered domain.
How does Domain Privacy work?
Because of ICANN's WHOIS policy, the personal information you list when registering your domain is available to anyone with Internet access. Domain Privacy through our official partner, Private Registry Authority® (PRA) circumvents this privacy issue by displaying PRA
information rather than your own personal data. Your personal information stays private while you maintain complete ownership and control of your domain at all times
Domain Privacy will shield you and your domain.
Stops domain hijackers
Stops data miners
Stops spammers
Stops identity fraud/theft
Prevent stalkers or harassers
How do I get Domain Privacy?
You can select Domain Privacy when registering any domain name through the shopping cart, or this can be added within your Account Manager to any existing domain.
