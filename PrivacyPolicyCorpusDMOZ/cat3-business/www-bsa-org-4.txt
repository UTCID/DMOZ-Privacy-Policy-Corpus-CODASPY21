Data Privacy
BSA members are committed to protecting the privacy and security of consumers’ data. BSA promotes a user-centric approach to privacy that provides consumers with control over their personal data while ensuring industry can continue delivering value to consumers by providing innovative products and services.
BSA supports a single, clear set of strong federal standards for consumer data privacy in the United States and encourages interoperability around the world. Privacy systems must support the free flow of data across international borders so cloud computing and other valuable data services can flourish.
With these considerations in mind, BSA has developed a Privacy Framework as a guide for policymakers as they seek to draft privacy legislation in the United States and BSA Global Privacy Best Practices to encourage high-level standards around the world.
BSA also supports efforts to ensure that law enforcement authorities can access stored content, but only pursuant to a process that has sufficient privacy and due process protections.
BSA supports modernizing data policies so they are clear, effective, and predictable for individuals, businesses, and governments.

The Future of Transatlantic Data Flows
SEP 23, 2020 | US
Companies of all sizes and in all industries need to move data across the Atlantic to reach customers, manage supply chains, collaborate on research, and improve the services they provide to businesses and individuals. And customers—on both sides of the Atlantic—deserve to know that their personal data will be maintained private and secure when their data is transferred. Transatlantic data flows are among the most important for both Europe and the US, accounting for over one-half of Europe’s data transfers and about half of US data transfers. A disruption of transatlantic data flows could have significant adverse effects on consumers, businesses, and economic vitality.

US: Comprehensive Federal Privacy Legislation Can Build on the CCPA
DEC 02, 2019 | US
Privacy is a critical concern for consumers, businesses, and lawmakers. Congress can build on the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to create comprehensive federal legislation that protects consumers nationwide. Federal law should not only contain rights and protections created by the CCPA, but should create new consumer rights and impose new obligations on businesses, so that businesses are accountable for processing data in line with consumer expectations.
