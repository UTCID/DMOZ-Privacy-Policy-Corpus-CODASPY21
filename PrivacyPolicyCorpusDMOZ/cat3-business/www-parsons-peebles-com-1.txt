We can explain the reasons for collection and discuss the consequences of not providing the information or of providing partial or incomplete information and the effect this may have on our ability to provide our services. Uses Made of Your InformationBy law we can only process your information if we can demonstrate the lawful grounds we have for doing so. Currently there are six potential lawful grounds for processing personal information, namely we have your consent;it is necessary for performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into such contract;it is necessary for our compliance with a legal obligation;it is in the public interest;it is necessary to protect your vital interests; orthat it is in our legitimate interest to do so but only where that interest does not override your interests or your fundamental rights and freedom.If none of these grounds apply or ceases to apply we must cease processing your personal information immediately.We may use personal information held about you in the following ways: –Activity or purpose of processingType of Data processedWhat is our Legal Ground for doing this?Registering you as a client or a service userYour identity and contact detailsPerformance of a contract Legal ObligationMaintaining our relationship with youYour identity and contact and profile detailsPerformance of contract Legal Obligation Legitimate Interest i.e. to keep our records updated and identifying how you use our servicesEnsuring that content from our website is relevant to you and is presented in the most effective manner for you including seeking your views on our products and servicesYour identity, contact, profile and technical detailsLegitimate Interest i.e. to review the services we supply to you and to inform our overall marketing strategyProcessing or delivering our products and services including managing your contractYour identity, contact, financial and transaction detailsPerformance of a contract Legal Obligation  Payment for ServicesYour identity, contact, financial and transaction detailsPerformance of a contractCredit verification and fraud detectionYour identity, financial and transaction detailsPerformance of a contractAdministration of our website and business (including webhosting and support)Your identity, contact and technical dataLegal Obligation Legitimate interest i.e. running business, ensuring security and performance of the website, admin and support, monitoring for viruses or malicious softwareTo make suggestions that may be of interest to you such as available upgrades and enhanced or additional related services or products and advise you on service/security or technical issues that may affect youYour identity, contact, profile and technical dataLegitimate interests i.e. to develop our servicesWe will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary in line with the purposes for which it was originally requested or collected or where we are required to do so for some legal or reporting purpose.In working out how long we retain personal data we look the type of personal data involved, the purpose of processing, how sensitive or confidential the data is and at legal and commercial considerations including any legal obligations we have. By way of example by law we are required to keep accounting records for six years after end of the year in which the last transaction occurred. This means that we will be required to keep some basic client details for that purpose even although our relationship with you may be at an end. However, it should be noted that the requirement is basic client details and therefore it is not legitimate to also keep information such as your preferences for that period of time.If you have any questions relating to either retention periods or more require more detail on the purposes of processing or the specific reason or legal grounds, we are relying on for that processing then please contact us for additional information. Sharing Your InformationWe will not sell the personal information that we collect from you and will only use it for the purposes set out in this privacy statement. We may share your personal information with the following parties: –Service providers who provide us with IT and administration services such as our IT Support and back up provider and webhosting company, our CRM database provider and social media and marketing services providers;Regulatory authorities who require reporting of our activities by law such as the tax authorities;Affiliates and associated legal entities within our family of companies but only for purposes which are consistent with this privacy statement;Professional advisers such as our lawyers, accountants, bankers and insurers; andThird parties to whom we sell, transfer or merge our business or any part of it. All third parties with whom we share your data are required to protect your personal data, treat it confidentially and to process it in accordance with the law. Where we use third parties we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that they are GDPR compliant and in particular that: –they have adequate technical and other measures in place to ensure the security of your personal information;that they only use it for specified purposes;That any employees or contractors who have access to the information are adequately trained and deal with it on a need to know basis only;and that they act only in accordance with our instructions. IP Addresses and Cookies  We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration.

Staff handling your personal data are also adequately trained in relation to the legal requirements for handling personal data. These include robust procedures for dealing with breaches including incident reporting and notifying the national supervisory or data protection authorities, and where appropriate you, of any breaches, the consequences of the same and the remedial action taken.If you are based in the EU, then where possible the information you provide us with will be held within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or within the UK. Overseas TransfersIf you are based in the EU, we would point out that countries outside of the EEA do not always have similar levels of protection for personal data as those inside the EEA. The law provides that transfers of personal data in respect of EU based individuals outside of the EEA is only permitted where that country has adequate safeguards in place for the protection of personal data.  Some types of processing may use cloud solutions which can mean information may sometimes be held on servers which are located outside of the EEA or may use processors who are based overseas.Where we use cloud-based services or third-party providers of such services and in either or both circumstances the data is processed outside of the EEA if you are an EU based individual that will be regarded as an overseas transfer. Before instigating an overseas transfer, we will ensure that the recipient country and/or processor has security standards at least equivalent to EU standards and in particular one of the following permitted safeguards applies: –The country in question is deemed to have adequate safeguards in place as determined by the European Commission; orThere is a contract or code of conduct in place which has been approved by the European Commission which gives your personal information the same protection it would have had if it was retained within the EEA; orIf the overseas transfer is to the United States, then the transferee is a signatory to the EU-US privacy Shield as all Privacy Shield signatories are obliged to give your personal information the same degree of protection it would have had if it was retained within the EEA.If none of these safeguards exist, then we may seek your explicit consent for an overseas transfer. In line with your rights as an individual you are free to withdraw this consent at any time.In respect of personal information collected in respect of non-EU based individuals or services which are not performed within the EU we will also ensure where possible this meets the GDPR standards unless these conflict with local data protection laws. However, you should be aware that if the country you reside in or are a citizen of is outwith the EU and the services you request are being performed outwith the EU and your personal information is being stored there then that personal information may be in a jurisdiction in which the data protection and privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as provided under the GDPR. Your RightsIn certain instances, you have rights as an individual which you can exercise in relation to the information we hold about you. These rights are:the right to restrict processing of your personal data;the right to rectification or correction of your personal data;the right to object to processing of your personal data;the right of erasure of personal data (also referred to the right to be forgotten);the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing or profiling;the right to transfer your personal data (also referred to as the right of portability)the right to withdraw your consent to processing your personal data; andthe right of access to your personal data. Additional information about these rights can be found on the Information Commissioner’s website at www.ico.org.uk/for-organisation/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/If you have provided consent and we are relying on that as the legal ground of processing your personal information and wish to exercise your right to withdraw that consent you can do so at any time by contacting us at uk@parsons-peebles.com. Access to Personal InformationWe try to be as open as we can in giving people access to their personal information.
