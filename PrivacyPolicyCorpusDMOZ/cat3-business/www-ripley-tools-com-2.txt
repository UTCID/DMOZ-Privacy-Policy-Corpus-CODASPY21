Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).What are cookies used for?Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Ripley Sites, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience. Cookies also make your interactions with Ripley faster.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Ripley does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.Controlling cookiesMost browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you.What to do if you don’t want cookies to be set or want them to be removed?If you are a Visitor, you can opt-out. If you do not want to receive cookies, you can change your browser settings on your computer or other device you’re using to access our services. If you use Ripley Sites without changing your browser settings, we’ll assume that you’re happy to receive all cookies on the Ripley websites. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies.
