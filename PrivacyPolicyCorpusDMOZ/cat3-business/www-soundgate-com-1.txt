Got It!
To do what we can to protect our home community of Stillwater, we are temporarily closing the doors to the KICKER Visitors Center and Museum, until further notice.
Stillwater Designs and KICKER itself, including orders and shipping, will continue to run under normal business operations.
Thank you for your patronage and patience, and please plan to visit the KICKER Visitors Center when it opens again. If you want to visit a local KICKER dealer in your area, we recommend calling ahead to confirm store hours and availability.
