Simply selectBy Product Type - the default option, providing all of our products in standard product categories. By Application - to browse products by their intended use;By Supplier - if you know who makes it. This will open a page dedicated to this supplier, with a list of categories of equipment and popular items they offer.Alternatively to perform a text based search for a product, enter the product name or number into the search box to the right of our company logo at the top of the page. If it matches any existing search terms you'll see suggestions and the number of results found for each suggestion. Select the most relevant search term or hit enter to search for what you have typed.Once you have opened a list of products, you are able to further refine your search by using the 'Shop By' filters to narrow down the list of available items. The filters available directly correspond to the products you have currently listed.Product InformationEach product page is similar in nature, and depending on whether you are logged in, or just browsing as a guest will determine how much information you receive. Many of our products can only be purchased once you've completed a number of configuration selections. As you make each selection, the model number (or SKU) will change. Some products are just too complex for us to be able to show you prices or stock status, in which case please request a quote or give our office a call so we can assist you further.Product ReviewsTo leave a product review, select the 'Review' tab on the pertinent product page and leave your review.

Orders & Shipping
Obtaining a QuoteRequesting a quote allows you to obtain a price for special order items and items that are not listed on our website. Firstly add a product to your quote request by clicking the "Add to Quote" button located under the product catalogue or on the product page itself. Once you have added all the products you wish to receive a quote for, select the "My Quote" button in the top right corner to view your quote request. On the Request for Quote page, enter the quantities required and your details under the "Remarks" heading at the bottom of the page. Click on "Submit Quote Request" to submit your request.Items that can't be orderedEven after registering, some products cannot be ordered online due to their extreme complexity. You will be able to request a quote for these items by selecting "Add to Quote" and then viewing our Request for Quote page.Availability & StockEx Stock Items: Orders comprising items shown as in stock will generally be shipped the following business day after payment has been receipted into our account. We will endevour to ship credit card orders the same day, where these are placed prior to 11:00AM WST, but this cannot be guaranteed. Please use the comments section to notify us of any specific urgency when placing your order, and we will do all we can to support your request.Backorder Items: Due to the nature and diversity of our product range we are not able to deliver everything from stock. In the event that your order comprises goods that are not in stock we will contact you once we have confirmed availability details. Most items are able to be shipped within 2 - 3 weeks at the outset. For Australian orders, where possible we will cover the costs of any additional freight associated with backordered items.Tax / GSTAs we are primarily a business to business supplier, prices on our web site DO NOT include Australian GST, which is automatically added if the delivery address for the order is within Australia. The tax applicable is shown as a separate component during checkout before you confirm your order. A valid tax invoice can be printed and will be emailed to you if you provide us with your email address at the time your order is placed. For international clients, as our prices do not include any local taxes they are effectively export prices. Shipments are subject to local customs inspection and assessment of duties and taxes in accordance with your country"s national legislation. We package goods for safe international transportation and provide multiple copies of commercial invoices and packing slips for customs entry requirements. Prices shown on customs documents are the actual invoice cost of the goods. Please do not ask us to show a different price.Payment OptionsDepending on your location and account type, the store allows a variety of payment methods including Credit Card, Electronic Funds Transfer or Telegraphic Transfer and Cheque. Our credit card facility features industry standard secure 128bit SSL encryption and Transtek's website is fully PCI compliant. As many of the items we offer online are not always available ex-stock we have a special arrangement with our credit card processor, so that your card is not charged until we are ready to ship your goods. Instead, a hold for the aount of your order is paced on your card until we know when we are able to supply your order, and it is only at this point that your card is charged. This also has the added advantage of allowing us to make changes to your order more easily. In extremely rare cases where the order cannot be completed for an extended period of time this hold may elapse before we are in a position to charge your card. If this occurs we will contact you to explain the situation and re-instate the hold or charge your card.Order AcceptanceTranstek accepts all orders subject to availability from our suppliers in line with our standard Terms & Conditions of Sale. While we endevour to keep details on this site up to date we cannot accept liability for errors, omissions or correctness of any detail or specifications. Should we become aware of any difficulty in supply or change in product or specification we will contact you and attempt to resolve the situation to your satisfaction.Shipping OptionsOur site allows as many shipping options as possible, dependant on your shipping destination. Carriage restrictions do apply for shipment of items that contain lithium ion batteries. Full details of shipping options and costs for your order, based on the weight / size of the items, are provided prior to you completing the checkout process.Free shipping: Transtek offers free shipping of all orders placed online where the nett value of the order (excluding tax) is greater than AUD $500.00 and where the delivery address is within Australia. Free shipping does not apply to resale and wholesale orders.
Warranty & Returns
WarrantyTranstek offers a warranty in line with that offered by the original manufacturer, unless specifically stated (see Special Exceptions below). We endevour to list the applicable warranty term for each product, which is subject to the manufacturers datasheet and user manual (as appropriate).RefundsWe want you to be satisfied with your purchase. To try and ensure this we offer a 7 day, NQA (No Questions Asked) return policy on selected items purchased online via this store unless specifically excluded elsewhere (see Special Exceptions above). This policy is only offered to retail (end-user) customers, and applies to items shipped from stock. Items must be returned in as-new condition complete with all accessories, manuals and packaging and must be fully operational. To take advantage of this policy, customers must contact Transtek by phone, fax or email within 7 days of the date of invoice. The item(s) must be returned to Transtek at the customer's cost within 7 days of notification of their intention to return the items.The purpose of this policy is to allow customers the added security to be able to purchase products sight unseen and return them, should they not, on physical inspection, be found to be suitable for the intended purpose. The 7 day NQA is specifically not intended for instances where an incorrect product is purchased, resale demonstrations, hire or other short term use. Transtek reserves the right on final inspection to refuse any return under this policy, or alternatively to offer a store credit in lieu of a refund where there is suspicion of the abuse of this policy.Upon our satisfaction that the customer has met their obligations under the 7 day NQA policy, the customer will be offered their choice of a refund or store credit for the invoice value of the goods. Shipping and payment costs are not refundable. In instances where the 7 Day NQA policy does not apply, applications for refunds will be assessed in line with best practice under Australian Consumer Protection legislation.Special ExceptionsSpecific products, particularly items offered as "end-of-line" or "web specials", may have specific returns policies and may not be subject to a manufacturer"s warranty, so be sure to read the information on the product pages concerned.See our Terms & Conditions of Warranty & Service for further details.
