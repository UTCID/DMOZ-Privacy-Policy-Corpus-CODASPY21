Terms of Use
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE. By using this site, you signify your assent to these terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms of use, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these terms at any time. Please check these terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of PICCADILLY.COM following the posting of changes to these terms (including the PICCADILLY.COM Privacy Policy) will mean you accept those changes.
RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF MATERIALS
This site is owned and operated by PICCADILLY RESTAURANTS, LLC. (referred to as "PICCADILLY," "we," "us," or "our" herein). No material from PICCADILLY.COM or any Web site owned, operated, licensed, or controlled by PICCADILLY may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or distributed in any way, except that you may download one copy of the materials on any single computer for your personal, noncommercial home use only, provided you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices. Modification of the materials or use of the materials for any other purpose is a violation of PICCADILLY's copyright and other proprietary rights. For purposes of these terms, the use of any such material on any other Web site or networked computer environment is prohibited. All trademarks, service marks, and trade names are proprietary to Piccadilly Restaurants, LLC.
SUBMISSIONS
PICCADILLY is pleased to hear from its loyal customers and welcomes your comments regarding PICCADILLY products and services, including PICCADILLY's online services. Unfortunately, however, PICCADILLY's long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when products or services developed by PICCADILLY's professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original materials such as recipes or artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials.
If at our request you send certain specific submissions (e.g., postings to chats, message boards, or contests) or, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain the property of, and shall be assigned to, PICCADILLY. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of PICCADILLY, and PICCADILLY shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, PICCADILLY shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights, title, and interest to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.
FORUMS AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATION
"Forum" means a chat area, bulletin board, or e-mail function offered as part of PICCADILLY.COM. You shall not upload to, distribute through, or otherwise publish through PICCADILLY.COM any content that is libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or otherwise give rise to liability or violates any law.
The Forums shall be used only in a noncommercial manner. You shall not, without our express approval, distribute or otherwise publish any material containing any solicitation of funds, promotion, advertising, or solicitation for goods or services. You specifically acknowledge that soliciting other PICCADILLY.COM guests to join or become members of any commercial online service or other organization is expressly prohibited.
It is our policy to respect the privacy of all guests. Therefore, in addition to the privacy of Registration data (see our Privacy Policy), we will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a guest's e-mail unless required in the course of normal maintenance of PICCADILLY.COM and its systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on PICCADILLY; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of PICCADILLY; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public. Guests shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages.
By uploading materials to any Forum or submitting any materials to us, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) us a perpetual, royaltyfree, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe. In addition, you warrant that all so-called moral rights in those materials have been waived.
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES
Unless otherwise specified, the materials in the site are presented solely for the purpose of promoting products and services available in the United States and its territories, possessions, and protectorates. This site is controlled and operated by PICCADILLY from its offices within the State of Louisiana, United States of America. PICCADILLY makes no representation that materials in the site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access this site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Software from this site is further subject to United States export controls. No software from this site may be downloaded or otherwise exported or reexported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria, or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading or using the Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.
TERMINATION
These terms are effective until terminated by either party. You may terminate these terms at any time by destroying all materials obtained from any and all PICCADILLY site(s) and all related documentation and all copies and installations thereof, whether made under the terms of these terms or otherwise. These terms will terminate immediately without notice from PICCADILLY if in PICCADILLY's sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or provision of these terms. Upon termination, you must destroy all materials obtained from this site and any and all other PICCADILLY site(s) and all copies thereof, whether made under the terms of these terms or otherwise.
DISCLAIMER
THE MATERIALS IN THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, PICCADILLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. PICCADILLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. PICCADILLY DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS SITE IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. YOU (AND NOT PICCADILLY) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Further, Piccadilly.com explicitly disclaims any responsibility for, or control over, and therefore accepts no liability for, the accuracy, content, or availability of information found on sites that link to or from Piccadilly.com from third parties not associated with Piccadilly. Piccadilly.com encourages discretion when browsing the Internet using our or anyone else's service. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, Piccadilly cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.
Piccadilly.com cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from Piccadilly.com, since other shop channels are owned and operated by independent retailers. Piccadilly.com does not endorse any of the merchandise, nor has Piccadilly.com taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of, any of the information contained in such third-party sites. Piccadilly.com does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be requested to give any third party, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL PICCADILLY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE MATERIALS IN THIS SITE, EVEN IF PICCADILLY OR A PICCADILLY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL PICCADILLY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT [INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE], OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE.
NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), notifications of claimed copyright infringement should be sent to Service Provider's Designated Agent.
OTHER
These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties.
