Use of Personal Information
The following is an overview of our purposes for using your personal information. Please remember that additional details on how we process your personal information may be provided to you in a separate notice or contract.
All processing (i.e. use) of your personal information is justified by a "condition" for processing. In addition, processing of sensitive personal information (such as health or racial information provided for a recruitment application) is always specifically justified. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the basis that:
the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request;
the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation;
the processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using supplier, customer and Website user data to conduct and develop our business activities with them and with others; or
you have consented to the processing.
We use the personal information we collect to:
conduct and develop our business with you and with others;
process, evaluate and complete certain transactions involving the Website, and more generally transactions involving NOV's products and services;
operate, evaluate, maintain, improve and develop the Website, and our products and services generally;
fulfil the purpose for which you provided your personal information;
customize our Website to users' needs;
engage you about events, promotions, the Website and NOV's products and services;
provide you with documentation or communications which you have requested;
correspond with users to resolve their queries or complaints;

manage, protect against and investigate fraud, risk exposure, claims and other liabilities, including but not limited to violation of our terms and conditions, contract terms or laws or regulations.
NOV will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
Disclosure of Personal Information
We are part of the global NOV group, and from time to time it will be necessary to share your information with our affiliated businesses. We may also appoint third party service providers (who will operate under our instructions) to assist us in providing information, products or services to you, in conducting and managing our business, or in managing and improving the Website. NOV may share your personal information with these affiliates and third parties for any of the following purposes:
to perform services that the third parties have been engaged by NOV to perform on NOV's behalf, subject to the obligations NOV assumes under this notice or the appropriate contractual restrictions and security measures;
if required to do so by law, a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request; or
if NOV believes it is reasonably necessary to prevent harm or loss, or it believes that the disclosure will further an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activities,
NOV reserves the right to share any information that you provide which is not deemed personal information.
You acknowledge that the Website is controlled, operated, and administered by NOV from its offices in the United States, or hosted on servers located globally, but managed by NOV. NOV is a global company and, as a result, NOV may transfer personal information collected on the Website or in the course of conducting business with you and others to other jurisdictions in which NOV operates. If your personal information is transferred outside the EEA to other NOV group companies or to third party service providers, we will take steps to ensure that your information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA, including by entering into data transfer agreements, using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield. For transfers to other NOV group companies in the United States (a country that has not received a decision from the EEA Commission determining that the United States provides adequate protection to personal information), we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, which protect personal information transferred between NOV entities. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your information is transferred outside of the EEA by contacting the Data Protection Manager at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..
We may share your personal information with third parties in connection with potential or actual sale of our company or any of our assets, or those of any affiliated company, in which case personal information held by us about our users may be one of the transferred assets.
We will also respond to requests for information where required by to do so by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request from a regulator or any other legal process served on us.
Children
The Website is not for use by children under the age of 16 years and NOV does not knowingly collect, store, share or use the personal information of children under 16 years. If you are under the age of 16 years, please do not provide any personal information, even if prompted by the Website to do so. If you are under the age of 16 years and you have provided personal information, please ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) to notify NOV and NOV will delete all such personal information.
Marketing SMS & emails
Where lawful to do so, and subject to your consent where required, we may communicate with you by SMS and email to tell you about our products and services. If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing communications, please use the 'unsubscribe' link provided in our emails or text the STOP number in our SMS, or otherwise contact us directly and we will stop sending you communications.
Security
NOV strives to safeguard and protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, and NOV utilizes and maintains certain reasonable processes, systems, and technologies to do so. However, you acknowledge that no transmission over the Internet is completely secure or error-free, and that these processes, systems, and technologies utilized and maintained by NOV are subject to compromise. Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control.
Retention of your Information
We apply a general rule of keeping personal information only for as long as required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, which will include the duration of the applicable statute of limitations. However, in some circumstances we may retain personal information for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by law, a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required.
In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal information for longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.
External Links
The Website may contain links to third party sites. Since NOV does not control nor is responsible for the privacy practices of those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party sites. This notice applies solely to personal information collected by our Websites or in the course of our business activities.

Subject to applicable law, you may have some or all of the following rights in respect of your personal information:
to obtain a copy of your personal information together with information about how and on what basis that personal information is processed;
to rectify inaccurate personal information (including the right to have incomplete personal information completed);
