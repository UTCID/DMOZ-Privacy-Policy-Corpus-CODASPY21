Purchase Orders & Credit Accounts
Purchase orders are welcome from tax-supported entities (e.g. public schools, universities). An account application may be requested for verification purposes.
Credit accounts for other institutions and businesses are also available with a credit check, references, and approved application. First order may be subject to prepayment. Past due balances are subject to a 1.5 % finance charge per month.

Vincent Lighting Systems Co. sells to anyone without regard to race, color, religion, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran status, or genetic information. We are committed to providing access, equal opportunity and reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities to our services.
Sales Tax
Orders are subject to sales tax unless we have a current sales tax exemption form on file for your organization. Sales tax liability varies by jurisdiction, as well as origin and destination of the shipment.
For orders shipped to states where we do not collect taxes, you are solely responsible to report & pay for all taxes, including use tax if applicable, to the Department of Revenue of your state. You can contact your respective taxing authority for detailed information.
Order Acceptance Policy
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. Vincent Lighting Systems reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason or to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item.
Order Processing Time
Most orders ship within 1 business day. If your order is not available to ship immediately that day you will be notified. Orders that require drop-shipping from our suppliers typically take 1-2 business days to process.
Online orders received by noon Eastern time typically ship the same day. If your delivery due date is critical please note your due date in the order messages at checkout, and then contact us.
Shipping & Handling
Most orders are shipped via UPS Ground. Expedited services are available upon request. We do not ship COD.
All products shipped F.O.B. shipping point.
Vincent Lighting Systems Co. is happy to arrange payment for shipping and insurance with the carrier, but such costs are the responsibility of the Customer. Risk of loss is upon the Customer once we, or our agent, deliver the product to the carrier.
Claims
VERY IMPORTANT:
If the package is obviously damaged, customer should sign for the shipment as "damaged" as legibly as possible, contact us immediately and make a claim with the carrier.
All damaged merchandise must be reported within 5 days.
If the package shows no obvious signs of damage but the merchandise is damaged or items are missing (shortage) when the package is opened, contact Customer Service immediately. The carrier is responsible for breakage in transit and we will assist in every possible manner to help you collect claims for loss or damage.
Where we Ship
We ship only to destination addresses in the United States (Alaska / Hawaii included, although free shipping is not offered to AK/HI addresses)
Many* items may be shipped to Canada, via Fedex Ground Canada, as they handle any customs brokerage.
We may allow for shipment to Freight Forwarders located within the U.S., depending on the item*. If we determine that we are unable to ship to a Freight Forwarding address, the order will be wholly canceled and the customer contacted.
The item is considered delivered at the Freight Forwarder.
Please arrange for the Freight Forwarder to inspect the package upon delivery.
Any damage found after delivery to the freight forwarder is the responsibility of the Freight Forwarder and any insurance the client chose to buy from the Freight Forwarder.
No claim can be made upon the original carrier once the Freight Forwarder ships it to the destination address.
*Some items are subject to technology embargos or our reseller license may be limited to a particular country or territory.
Time in Transit
Shipping time does not include the day your order departs its point of origin. For example, a 2DAY shipment method departing on Monday will arrive on Wednesday. A 3DAY shipment method departing on Monday will arrive on Thursday. Holidays and weekends are not counted as transit days but do count as delivery days only if the appropriate shipment method is requested. Higher shipping rates apply for Saturday deliveries. If you need assistance in estimating the Time in Transit for your order, please contact us. We'll be happy to assist you.
Delivery times are provided by the carrier and are only estimates.
Vincent Lighting Systems shall not be liable for delays due to carrier delivery issues, including but not limited to; inclement weather, roadway accidents, train derailments, flight delays, package being on the wrong truck, a pandemic, local/state/federal business and travel restrictions, and the catch-all of the insurance companies, an “Act of God” event*, including but not limited to murder hornets, alien invasions, zombie uprisings, or kaiju attacks.
*For instance, in the unlikely event that the Browns win the Super Bowl, we cannot guarantee shipping because we'll be busy celebrating.
