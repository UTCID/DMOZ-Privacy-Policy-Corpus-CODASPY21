TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES AND AFLAC, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. AFLAC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SITE OR THE SERVERS THAT MAKE THE SITE AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. AFLAC DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE MATERIAL, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, FACILITIES, SERVICES, OR OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITE OR ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO THE SITE IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.

Binding Arbitration of All Disputes; No Class Relief.
U.S. Residents: To the fullest extent permissible by law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to Aflac’s intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitrable, any dispute of any kind between you and Aflac arising under these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any Georgia state or federal court with substantial experience in the insurance industry and shall follow Georgia substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section 9(a) shall be construed as a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and we agree that we intend that this Section 9(a) satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA. The hearing shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to Aflac. For any claim in which you seek U.S. $10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing. For those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, Aflac shall pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator. Aflac agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration. AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.
Non-U.S. Residents: If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Services or Terms, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 9(b) Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 9(b). Your notice to us must be sent to us at Contact Us Online. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Aflac and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 9(b) Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Aflac to resolve the Section 9(b) Dispute on terms which either you or Aflac, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable with. Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.

Product Specifications; Pricing; Typographical Errors.
We do our best to describe every product or service offered through the services as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content of the Services is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, Aflac shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion. If we charged your credit card or other account prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. Additional Terms may apply.
Seller; Risk of Loss.
Aflac is or may be the seller of various goods and services through the Services. All items purchased from the Services are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier.
Indemnity.
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Aflac, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and its officers, directors, employees, principals, agents, distributors, representatives, proprietors, partners, shareholders, principals, predecessors, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, resulting from your breach of these Terms, including any of the foregoing provisions, representations or warranties, from your placement or transmission of any content onto Aflac's servers and/or from any and all use of the Services or your account.
System Abuse.
Without limitation, you agree not to send, create, or reply to so called “mailbombs” (i.e., emailing copies of a single message to many users, or sending large or multiple files or messages to a single user with malicious intent) or engage in “spamming” (i.e., unsolicited emailing for business or other purposes) or undertake any other activity which may adversely affect the operation or enjoyment of the Services by any other person. You are prohibited from using any services or facilities provided in connection with the Services to compromise security or tamper with system resources and/or accounts. The use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security (e.g., password guessing programs, cracking tools, malware, or network probing tools) is strictly prohibited. If you become involved in any violation of system security, Aflac reserves the right to release your details to system administrators at other sites, law enforcement and/or governmental authorities in order to assist them in resolving security incidents.
You may not reproduce, sell, resell, or otherwise exploit any resource, or access to any resource, contained on the Services. In addition, you are prohibited from removing any material inserted by Aflac anywhere on the Site (e.g., on any web space made available for your use).
Passwords and Security.
Any usernames and passwords used for the Services are for individual use only. You shall be responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your username and password (if any). Aflac shall be entitled to monitor your username and password and, at its discretion, require you to change it. If you use a username and password that Aflac considers insecure, Aflac will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your account.
Investigations.
Aflac reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms. Aflac may seek to gather information from the user who is suspected of violating these Terms and from any other user. If Aflac believes, in its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms has occurred, it may terminate accounts, or take other corrective action it deems appropriate. Aflac will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Aflac to disclose the identity of anyone believed to violate these Terms. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS AFLAC FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY AFLAC DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUNCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY AFLAC OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
