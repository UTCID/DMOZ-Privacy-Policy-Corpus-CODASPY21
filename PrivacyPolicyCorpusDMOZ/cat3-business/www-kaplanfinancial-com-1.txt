We understand that you should be in control of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy explains the manner in which we collect personal information from you and
the purpose of collecting the data. This Privacy Policy is designed to ensure that you are aware of how your personal information is being used and to provide you with choices about that use. We are required under data protection legislation to notify
anyone who provides personal information to us, either directly or through a third party, of the information contained in this Privacy Policy. By visiting the Site or submitting your personal information, you accept the terms described in the Privacy

collect and store any personal information you provide to us that may be contained in any video, comment or another submission you upload or post to the Site. Personal Information might also include title, telephone number; your likeness; and, if
you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). If sensitive information is collected, we will take appropriate efforts to comply with
industry standards for the protection and proper disposal of all sensitive data, both online and offline.

Examples of information that we may receive include:
updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.Data Protection Principles. We will comply with data protection law, which says that the personal information we hold about you must be:Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way;Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes;Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes;Accurate and kept up to data;Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about; andKept securely.Automated InformationCollection. We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your use of the Site.Information collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser when you interact with our Site. This information includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of
any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.Cookies. When you visit our website, we use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site, to allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's password-protected features, and to collect information about your use of the Site. Cookies
also benefit you by creating a more streamlined login process and keeping track of your language of choice between sessions, among other things. As we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that the information provided
to you will be relevant to your needs.A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies are small files and won't pose any significant disk-space concerns.
You can disable our cookies using the cookie-menu on your Web browser, but doing so may materially affect the functionality of this Site and the information you can access through it. To learn more about cookies and browser functionality, search for
"cookies" in the help function of your browser.Other Technologies. Like many websites, we may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, site tags, clear GIFs, and other similar technologies, to collect and maintain information about your web-surfing activity when you are visiting
this Site, other Kaplan sites, as well as other non-Kaplan sites. We also may include web beacons or pixels tags in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage
and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image. Often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drive. Pixel tags allow us to count users who have visited
certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.Do Not Track Practices. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always
clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Kaplan currently
does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.How We Use the Information We Collect. We will only use your personal information when the law allows.
