The Data We Collect
In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, we collect your computer’s or mobile device’s IP address, which you necessarily disclose when you visit the Site, so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to your computer or device. The Site utilizes "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer that web pages on the Site may use to store data on your computer or send data to our web server. We may use cookie data to "recognize" you when you visit the Site in the future, to troubleshoot how the Site operates, and for internal analysis of how people use the Site. Should you decide not to accept cookies from the Site, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit and use the Site. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Site.
