Credit Card PolicyCredit Card Policy (for Fraud Protection)Credit Card ProcessingWe accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover as forms of payment. Each credit card company has established policies and procedures that we as a Merchant (seller) must adhere to. There are also responsibilities that you as the "buyer" must adhere to which could include proof that you are the "in fact cardholder" by means of reasonable identification (business or other listed telephone number that we can verify).If you feel like any of our "verification" policies are not in line with your credit card companies polices, please contact your credit card company at the number below for assistance:American Express:(800)528-5200Discover:(800)347-2000VISA:(800)228-1122MasterCard:(800)826-2181Credit Card Authorization FormFor all card printers and orders over $250, we require you complete a Credit Card Charge Authorization Form. Please call us at (714)922-1140 for details.Bill-To Address PolicyOur Merchant Processing system (what we use to process credit cards) is secure and requires us to verify with the issuing bank the "Registered Billing Address" prior to approval or shipment of your order. Additionally, per the Credit Company documented procedures, we can only ship to the verified Ship-To address (see Ship-To Address Policy for more info).Ship-To Address PolicyIf your Ship-To address is different than your Bill-To address, please make sure that you have established the alternative Ship-To address. Virtually ALL credit card companies allow you to do this by contacting them and telling them you want to add an "Alternative Shipping Address" that can be verified by a merchant such as IDcardPrinterSavings.com. This is an address that allows us upon authorization by the credit card company to ship to a address different than the registered billing address.FRAUDWe thank you for your business and hope that you understand that with the level of Internet credit card fraud approaching billions of dollars in losses annually, we must adhere to the policies of the issuing credit card company to protect us. This means that at times we may require further documentation than that of a normal on-line transaction and require copies of both your credit card and government-issued identification card.Additionally, in order to continue to maintain our low prices, we have had to institute strict fraud prevention measures for certain products (e.g. ID Card printers and supplies, large touchscreen monitors, etc) that are deemed high-risk. As such, if you are NOT a government, education, or major corporation, we may require a Company Verification Form to be completed as well as pre-payment via wire transfer or Western Union (individual credit cards will NOT be accepted).We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you, but we hope you appreciate the low prices this allows us to offer you.EnforcementWe will prosecute FRAUD to the fullest extent of the law and work with all law enforcement agencies (including the FBI, Secret Service and any other department) to validate or help in preventing FRAUDULENT use of credit cards and or checks!International Credit CardsWe do NOT accept International Credit Cards!IMPORTANT NOTE: We do not process credit card charges online in real time due to the high level of Internet fraud. We only process your credit card upon verification with your bank or issuing Credit Card Company; you may also receive an email from our Credit Card Merchant Processor noting any charge activity or credits to your account.
