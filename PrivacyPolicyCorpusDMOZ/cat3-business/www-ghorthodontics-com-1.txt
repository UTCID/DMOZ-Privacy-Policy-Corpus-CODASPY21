Location of Information
G&H Orthodontics is a global organization with its corporate headquarters in the United States. Our servers, databases, and service providers are located in the United States and in other countries. Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements, and some, including the United States, may provide less legal protection for your personal information than others. By using this site, you are consenting to the collection, use and transfer of your personal information in or to the United States or other countries for the purposes described in this Online Privacy Policy.
Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect information from children to sell or promote our products or services. We do not invite minors to contact us or provide personal information. Visitors must be 18 years of age or older to submit registration or survey information.

Security
We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your personal information. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via SSL (Secure Sockets Layers) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
We urge users to be careful with personal information while using the Internet. "Perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and we cannot guarantee the safety of transmitting personal information over the Internet.
