HIPAA Privacy & Security11.1 Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined in this Section 11, shall have the same meanings as those terms in the Standards for the Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), codified at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164. “Protected Health Information” or “PHI,” as used in this Agreement, means (subject to definition provided at 45 C.F.R. 160.103) individually identifiable health information that you receive from BenefitMall or that you create or receive on behalf of BenefitMall in connection with this Agreement.11.2 This Section 11 is intended to comply with the requirements of the Business Associate agreements BenefitMall has entered into with insurers subject to HIPAA, and is to be constructed to achieve compliance with those requirements. BenefitMall is contractually prohibited from sharing PHI with you without your agreement to comply with the terms of this Section 11.11.3 You may use or disclose PHI only for the purposes of fulfilling your obligations under brokerage agreements with BenefitMall’s affiliated carriers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not use or further disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. You may use and disclose PHI for your proper management and administration or to carry out your legal responsibilities consistent with the provisions of 45 C.F.R 164.504(e)(4)(i) and (ii). You may only disclose PHI for such purposes if:(a) the disclosure is required by law; or(b) you obtain reasonable assurances from the person to whom the information is disclosed that it will remain confidential and be used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies you of any instances of which he or she is aware in which the confidentiality of the information was breached.11.4 You will not use or further disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by this Agreement or as required by law.11.5 You will ensure that any agent of yours, including a subcontractor of yours, to whom you provide PHI received from or created or received by you on behalf of BenefitMall, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to you with respect to such information.11.6 In accordance with 45 C.F.R. 164.520, and to the extent that such a limitation may affect your use or disclosure of PHI, BenefitMall will notify you of any limitation(s) and changes in, or revocation of, permission by an individual to use or disclose PHI.11.7 You will use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this Agreement. You will implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the electronic PHI that you create, receive, maintain or transmit on behalf of BenefitMall as required by the HIPAA Security Standard, as amended from time to time. You will report to BenefitMall any security incident of which you become aware.11.8 You agree to mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect that is known to you of a use or disclosure of PHI by you in violation of the requirements of this Section 11.11.9 You will report to BenefitMall any use or disclosure of PHI not provided for by this Section 11 of which you become aware.11.10 You will make PHI and information related to disclosures of PHI by you available to BenefitMall in the time, manner and place designated by BenefitMall, to the extent required to provide an accounting of disclosures in accordance with 45 C.F.R. 164.528. You agree to document such disclosures of PHI and information related to such disclosures as would be required for an entity subject to HIPAA to respond to a request by an individual for an accounting of disclosures of PHI in accordance with C.F.R. 164.528.11.11 If you receive a request, made on behalf of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, that you make your internal practices, books and records relating to the use and disclosures of PHI available to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the purposes of determining a covered entity’s compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, then you will promptly comply with the request.11.12 Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, if feasible, you will destroy or return PHI received from BenefitMall or created or received by you on behalf of BenefitMall that you still maintain in any form and retain no copies of such information. If such destruction or return is not feasible, you will extend the protections of this Section 11 to the information retained and limit further use and disclosure to those purposes that make the destruction of the information infeasible.11.13 The term of this Section 11 shall terminate when all of the PHI provided by BenefitMall to you, or created or received by you on behalf of BenefitMall, is destroyed.12. Miscellaneous12.1 This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the principles of conflict of laws. You irrevocably consent to bring any action to enforce or relating to this Agreement in the federal or state courts located in the County of Dallas, Texas. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Sites, the Apps, the Content, the Software, or this Agreement must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.12.2 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and BenefitMall with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter, except to the extent the parties have agreed to a written Client Services Agreement, in which case such Client Services Agreement shall control to the extent there is a conflict between the Client Services Agreement and this Agreement.12.3 In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions in this Agreement will remain in full force and effect unless the invalid provision constitutes the essence of this Agreement.12.4 If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this BenefitMall® User Agreement and any additional terms and conditions provided in any other agreement between you and BenefitMall and/or included in different parts of the Sites or Apps (the “Supplemental Terms”), such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, this Agreement shall have control over the Supplemental Terms.12.5 Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement as well as any other provisions, which by their terms or meaning are intended to survive.12.6 The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.12.7 You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, and any assignment shall be considered null and void.12.8 This Agreement is intended for the sole benefit of BenefitMall and you and does not create any third party beneficiary rights.12.9 BenefitMall reserves the right to update this Agreement at any time and from time-to-time, effective upon posting of an updated version to the Apps or BenefitMall website available at www.benefitmall.com. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement. You should closely monitor the revision date on this Agreement and any changes of its posted date shall be deemed notice to you that the Agreement has been changed or amended.

The parties also agree to take such action as is necessary to amend this Agreement from time to time as is necessary to comply with applicable laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA requirements.12.10 Please report any violations of this Agreement to our support group at termsandconditions@benefitmall.com. Your use of the Sites or Apps will be deemed acceptance of the above Terms and Conditions.12.11 This Section applies to your use of the Apps only if you use the Apps on an Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) phone or mobile device. You and BenefitMall acknowledge that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be considered to have accepted that right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. BenefitMall, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you may have relating to the Apps or your possession or use of the Apps. In the event of any failure of the Apps to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Apps to you.

In addition, Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Apps. In the event of any third party claim that the Apps or your possession and use of the Apps infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, BenefitMall, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.13.
