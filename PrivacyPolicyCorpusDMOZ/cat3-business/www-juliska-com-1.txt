a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf; and
your physical or electronic signature.
You acknowledge and agree that upon receipt and notice of a claim of infringement, we may immediately remove the identified materials from our Sites without liability, and the claims of the complaining party and party that originally posted the materials will be referred to the United States Copyright Office for adjudication as provided in the DMCA.
Counter-Notice by Accused User
If we have taken down your materials due to suspicion of copyright infringement, you may dispute the alleged infringement by sending a written communication by mail or email to our designated agent below. That written communication should include the following:
your physical or electronic signature;
identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which such address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of copyright infringement or an agent of such person.
After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.
After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed or disabled. If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.
Please send all notices under the above copyright infringement policies to Penshurst Trading’s agent for receipt of notifications of claimed infringement:
Penshurst Trading
[ADDRESS]
[EMAIL]
Please do not send notices or inquiries about anything other than alleged copyright infringement to our Agent for Notice.
Repeat Infringers
Your account may be terminated if, in our discretion, you are determined to be a repeat infringer. Repeat infringers are users who have been the subject of more than one valid takedown request that has not been successfully rebutted.
U.S. Pricing Policy
Our goal is to have clear and understandable pricing for our products. The prices displayed on the Sites are quoted in U.S. Dollars and are valid and effective only in the United States. Additional shipping and other charges may apply for orders outside of the United States and/or into U.S. territories, and you will be advised of such charges and your responsibility for any portion thereof before we finalize and ship your order. Furthermore, while we do our best to assure that the taxes quoted for a particular order are accurate for the applicable location to which the order is being shipped, should an erroneous quote be provided, we will notify you of such error before finalizing and shipping your order. You will be responsible for all applicable taxes, regardless of the amount quoted on the Sites at the time of your order. Product availability and prices are subject to change. Penshurst Trading reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update product pricing, availability or other information at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). If you do not wish to continue your purchase after pricing or other information has been corrected, please contact us right away and we will work with you to cancel or return your order.
Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights
You and Penshurst Trading agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and Penshurst Trading hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Penshurst Trading relating to these Terms of Use or the Sites (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator shall apply [STATE] law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration against Penshurst Trading, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees. If Penshurst Trading initiates arbitration against you, Penshurst Trading will pay for the arbitrator’s services and any other JAMS fees associated with the arbitration. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Penshurst Trading shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED. BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION. DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.
No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms of Use will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms of Use. This Section of the Terms of Use will survive the termination of your relationship with Penshurst Trading.
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN JAMS RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR PENSHURST TRADING WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
These Terms and Conditions May Change
Penshurst Trading reserves the right to update or modify these Terms of Use at any time without prior notice. Those changes will go into effect on the Last Updated Date shown in the revised Terms of Use. By continuing to use the Sites, you are agreeing to the revised Terms of Use. For this reason, we encourage you to review these Terms of Use whenever you purchase products from us or use our Sites.
Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old to use the Sites. If you are under the age of majority in your state of residence (a minor) your parent or legal guardian must agree to these Terms and Conditions on your behalf and you may only access and use the Sites with permission from your parent or legal guardian.
Other Provisions
Penshurst Trading controls and operates the Sites from its offices within the United States. Claims relating to, including the use of, the Sites and the materials contained herein are governed by the laws of the United States and the state of [STATE], without regard for its conflicts of law provisions. Penshurst Trading and you agree irrevocably submit that the state or federal courts located in [STATE], as applicable, will have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any claims or disputes arising out of or related to these Terms of Use that are not subject to binding arbitration as set forth herein. You expressly and irrevocably submit and consent in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in such court, and you hereby waive any objection that you may have based upon lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens. If you do not agree, please do not use the Sites. If you choose to access the Sites from another location, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws.
Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.
The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.
We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms of Use, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.
