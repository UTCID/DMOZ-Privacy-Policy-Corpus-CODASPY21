Data Collection
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer’s domain name, but not the e-mail address (where possible).
We collect aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit through web server logs. This process is to help us analyze our site. Our web server logs do not identify who a visitor is, collect email addresses, or other personal information.
The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is used to improve the content of our Web page, or to customize the content and/or layout of our site for each individual visitor.
Cookies
Cookies are small data files which record information, and are stored on your hard drive while you are browsing our site. We only use cookies to record session information, such as keeping track of items that are added to the shopping cart in our online catalog.
Information You Provide Us
Some information volunteered by our visitors is collected and kept. This includes survey information and/or site registrations, product specification inquiry forms, and the e-mail addresses of those who purchase products through our online catalog.
We do not sell or share any of your information with a third party, and we do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies. We never provide the e-mail addresses of our visitors to anyone else.
The only exception being when an order is placed using our online catalog. Then we will share sufficient information with the freight company to facilitate shipment of the product ordered. If a product needs to be shipped from one of our suppliers, we will provide them only the shipping and product information needed to have the products you have ordered shipped to your address.
Secure Transactions
We employ the services of Stripe to handle secure online payments, using state of the art encryption. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.
