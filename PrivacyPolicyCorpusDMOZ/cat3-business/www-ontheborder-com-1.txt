Dispute Resolution. You agree that whenever you have a disagreement with us arising out of, connected to, or in any way related to the Terms and/or the Services, you will send a written notice to us (“Demand”). You agree that the requirements of this section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms. You must send this Demand to the following address (the “Notice Address”): Chief Financial Officer, OTB Acquisition, LLC d/b/a On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina, 2201 W. Royal Lane, Suite 240, Irving, TX 75063. You agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until ten (10) business days after you send this Demand.
If we do not resolve this disagreement to your satisfaction within ten (10) business days, and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “Arbitrator”). Review this section carefully. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION LIMITS YOUR AND ON THE BORDER’S ABILITY TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT AND YOU AND ON THE BORDER EACH AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OR A STATE OR FEDERAL JUDGE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT FILE ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. You agree that if you do sue us in state or federal court, and we bring a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay all fees and costs incurred by us in court, including reasonable attorney’s fees. Please note that for any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must effect proper service under the rules of the Arbitrator, and that notice to the Notice Address may not suffice. If, for any reason, the AAA is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedure as effective September 15, 2005 (as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute Resolution section. You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute you have with us. The Federal Arbitration Act allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT FILE A CLASS ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ACTION AGAINST US, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ACTION AGAINST US. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT JOIN YOUR CLAIMS TO THOSE OF ANY OTHER PERSON. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THESE TERMS, IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS INVALIDATED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS NULL AND VOID, AS THOUGH IT WERE NEVER ENTERED INTO. Any dispute at that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled in a court. Under no circumstances do you or we agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration. We agree that we will submit all disputes with you to arbitration before the Arbitrator.
Changes in Terms and Conditions. We may modify or terminate our Services from time to time, for any reason, and without notice, including the right to terminate with or without notice, without liability to you, any other user or any third party. We reserve the right to modify these Terms from time to time without notice. Please review these Terms from time to time so that you will be apprised of any changes.
Governing Law. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.
Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by On The Border’s Chief Financial Officer and/or Chief Executive Officer.
Sometimes campaigns may involve special terms and conditions that will be applied specifically to those campaigns.
