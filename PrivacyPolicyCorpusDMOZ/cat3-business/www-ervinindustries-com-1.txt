Abrasive Blasting Materials
Ervin Industries brings atomizing technology to metal blasting materials for unmatched quality and accuracy. What began in 1920 is now an innovative company that is known worldwide as an industry leader in blast cleaning, shot peening, stone cutting, and other advanced metal powder processes. Over the decades, a keen eye on technology and a strong commitment to excellence have solidified Ervin Industries as the standard for metal particle performance.
Technology
Blasting materials began as a very low-tech endeavor, but today these powders and particles are engineered using the latest technological advancements and high-grade materials. Ervin technicians work diligently to create metal particle concepts that produce uniformity in a variety of blasting, peening, and cutting applications. Through advanced atomization technology, Ervin Industries produces superior blasting material with uniform microstructure and chemistry.
Application
Ervin Industries products are applied in a wide variety of industries, and they are organized into three categories: blasting and surface preparation, peening, and cutting media. Media blasting is the heartbeat of Ervin Industries and the founding product of the company. We are uniquely qualified to provide the technology and application assistance needed to produce the precision and finish your company needs.
Peening, while similar to media blasting, requires particles of supreme uniformity. Our products provide exactly that, and peening applications allow our customers to fully take advantage of the benefits of our product performance advantages.
Stone cutting with Ervin Industries materials allows for a longer life of the saw blade and creates a more uniform cut. Our high-performance stone cutting products are used in large-scale granite or marble cutting, where long-lasting media and precision are imperative to the productivity of the operation.
Products
From the uniformity that makes AMASTEEL stand out when compared to any other steel abrasive product on the market to the durable characteristics of AMACAST stainless steel abrasive, Ervin Industries products are built to rise above the competition. In fact, we have created the world standard for steel abrasive testing machines, which have become a fixture with our competitors.
