Information
Prices are subject to change without notice. We try to accurately display the colors of our products on this Web Site. However, the colors you see will depend on your monitor and its settings. We cannot guarantee that your display will be accurate. We do not warrant the currency, accuracy or reliability of any Web Site information, including information about product price or availability.
DiscountFavors.com may contain links to third party sites. Any outside links are provided only as a convenience. Your use of outside links is at your sole risk. Links from this Web Site do not constitute DiscountFavors.com endorsement of any third party, its website, or its goods or services. DiscountFavors.com is not responsible for any outside sites, services or other materials linked to or from this Web Site, and disclaims all liability for any injury you may experience by using such materials.
Your receipt, electronically or otherwise, of an order confirmation does not in any way signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute a confirmation or promise of our offer to sell. DiscountFavors.com reserves the right to refuse or decline your order at any time for any reason.
Validating Your Order
After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will check the information you give us for validity by verifying the method of payment, billing address, and shipping address. We reserve the right to reject any order placed and to limit quantities on any order for any reason. If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address provided.
If your order is rejected, your credit or debit card may indicate a "Pending Charge" which is a temporary charge that is automatically removed within 1-3 business days.
Payment
Payment is due in full prior to commencement of production. Credit card authorization and address verification must be received prior to processing the order form.
Sales Tax
DiscountFavors.com is required by law to collect all applicable sales tax for the State of Florida. Any entity who is tax exempt must submit their resale or tax exemption certificate by fax to (800) 939-1934. Orders will not be processed until the required documentation has been received.
Alterations
If the artwork has entered the production process, a $30.00 alteration fee shall be assessed.
Note: NO CHANGES whatsoever will be accepted on 24HR or 3-Day Rush Orders.
Cancellation Of Order
Handy Advertising, LLC begins production on incoming orders almost immediately. Our production line works 5 days a week in order to meet customers' timelines. Therefore, we will not accept any order cancellation requests. As you know, a custom printed order may not be resold or restocked at our end; therefore Handy Advertising, LLC will only issue a store credit for orders that require cancellation. This in-store credit will not expire, and may be used towards any item (both blank and custom printed wares) in our inventory.Handy Advertising, LLC makes several attempts to contact the customer in the event no artwork/logo is received, therefore we will not be responsible for the timeline of an order if we do not receive the artwork/logo. There is a $25.00 cancelation fee if an order is canceled. This rule applies to normal production orders only. There are NO cancelations for any rush contracts.
Return & Refund Policy
As you may or may not be aware, custom printed products cannot be restocked and, therefore, are not returnable. The industry standard for customized products dictates a no return / no refund policy. Blank, unprinted items also cannot be returned because once the product is cut and sewn, it is deemed to be customized. Returns or refunds will not be accepted if an order is delivered late due to shipping delays which are out of our control.
Replacement Policy
If an order is not well received - either due to a typo or other issues - our policy to redo the order and ship it via ground shipping method will still prevail. When an error has been confirmed, (upon following instructions under "claims") we will make every attempt to promptly redo the order. We will process the redo order exactly as you had originally requested minus any errors that we made. We will not change the product, the logo or artwork or the imprint color when processing the redo unless pre-approved by us.
Store Credit
When a redo is no longer practical or even feasible, (either due to event date timelines, out-of-stock or quantity issues) Handy Advertising, LLC will issue a store credit for up to the same value as the original order minus any shipping fees. Shipping charges will not be credited back as this charge is made on behalf of the shipping company. The store credit may be treated as cash, and may be used at any time and on any product we stock.
Due to FDA regulations, we CANNOT accept returns for the following items:
Cups (plastic, glass, Styrofoam, or otherwise),
Mugs,
Travel mugs,
Sports or water bottles,
Glassware, including plates,
Or any product not listed above used to support consumption.
Claims
If an order is not well received - either due to a typo or other issues - please contact our Customer Service Department at 1-800-939-1980 within 7 days of receipt of goods: DO NOT DISCARD DEFECTIVE OR DAMAGED MERCHANDISE. Claims will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine the most effective resolution. We may request a digital image or a physical sample of the item depicting the problem. Upon receipt of requested sample, we will promptly resolve the issue within reason. Claims resulting in refunds require the return of the defective or damaged items per the credit card industry standard. An RMA (Return Manufacturer's Authorization) may be issued to return the goods. Failure to return original merchandise will result in money owed for original and reprint orders: WE DO NOT PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING. We do not accept unauthorized returns. When applicable, discounts or refunds will be deducted from the product price ONLY. Discounts or refunds do NOT apply toward shipping, or other ancillary costs. Discounts or refunds will be issued in the form of a check or credit card refund (based on the original method of payment). Our Credit card authorization system does not allow access to a customer's credit card after a 48 hour period (this feature provides optimal protection of our customers' confidential information).
Check Returns/ Insufficient Funds
A $50.00 non-refundable Returned Check Fee will be assessed for all checks returned due to insufficient funds.
Shipping
Once an order leaves the warehouse, title of the goods passes to the buyer. DiscountFavors.com does not assume liability for breakage, carrier delays, or lost or misplaced packages caused by the carrier, or delays due to acts of God. Claims must be filed with the carrier within 7 days of receipt of package(s). DiscountFavors.com is not responsible in the event the customer refuses delivery or customer is not available to accept delivery.
Product Displays & Colors
DiscountFavors.com attempts to display product as accurately as possible. However, we cannot guarantee that the color seen matches the product color, as the display of the color depends, in part, upon the monitor used. Item samples are available to provide optimal interpretation of item color and quality. Note: sample request fulfillment is subject to product availability.
Handling Recommendations
All steel and plastic travel mugs, plastic bottles, as well as some glass products should only be hand washed. It is not recommended to wash these products in a dishwasher as this will promote fading (and gradual loss) of the imprint.
Liquid Capacity
The size and liquid capacity noted on each of our products* (for example: 16 oz) is only an "approximation" and cannot be construed as the exact size or capacity. These indications only serve as generalizations. The liquid capacity is measured up to the rim of the cups, glassware, mugs, or bottles when filled with water.
*These items are therefore offered AS IS.
Camouflage Pattern Disclaimer
All camouflage item patterns are random and variable. Due to comparable colors, the imprint may not be legible in all areas.
Proposition 65
Also known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, California Proposition 65 is a law that requires warning to consumers if a product exposes consumers to a wide variety of chemicals including lead and cadmium. Prop 65 does not ban any product; it simply requires warnings. Prop 65 applies only in California, and covers all products distributed in the state. Please note that DiscountFavors.com complies with all Federal Regulations concerning chemical contents. The State of California requires significantly stricter standards be met.
California Proposition 65 ("Prop 65") Compliance
The State of California requires that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving a clear and reasonable warning. Accordingly, if a buyer or distributor ("Supplier") fail to provide DiscountFavors.com advance written notice that any product will be sold or shipped to the State of California, the Supplier hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend and hold harmless DiscountFavors.com, its agents, employees, representatives and affiliated companies, from and against any and all Proposition 65, personal injury and property damage claims, and from all other costs, liabilities, damages and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees and litigation expenses on account thereof or in connection with any investigation or preparation related thereto or the enforcement of this provision) relating to, resulting from, connected with or arising out of goods or products provided to buyer by DiscountFavors.com, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Trademarks
In the event DiscountFavors.com is asked by a customer to use any logo, copy, trademarked or copyrighted intellectual property, the customer must provide in written form, a signed copy of an official body authorizing the use of said intellectual property. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable copyright and trademark laws, and by using such intellectual properties, the customer agrees to accept full responsibility from any lawsuit issued as a result of the use of intellectual properties. The customer also agrees to waive any right to bring legal action against DiscountFavors.com for the use of intellectual properties. The customer is also responsible for all legal fees, attorney's fees, court costs, and other damages and expenses incurred by DiscountFavors.com as a result of any lawsuit resulting from the use of intellectual properties at the customer's direction. Logos used on this website are an indication of imprint ability, and do not necessarily reflect endorsement of these products by these companies.
