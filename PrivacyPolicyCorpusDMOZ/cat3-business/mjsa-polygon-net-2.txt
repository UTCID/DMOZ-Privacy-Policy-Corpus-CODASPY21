LAST MODIFIED NOVEMBER 2017
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS.
This Agreement provides the general terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use") applicable to all services offered by Polygon to you (the "Services"), including access to its website located at www.Polygon.net (the "Site"), to its applications and social media groups, and any other Services that Polygon may offer from time to time to its members. By accessing or using the Site and/or any other Polygon Services, you accept without limitations or qualifications to be bound by the Terms of Use. Polygon reserves the right to change the Terms of Use from time to time at its sole discretion. Your use of the Site and/or access to any other Polygon Services will be subject to the most current version of the Terms of Use posted on the Site at the time of such use. The most current version of the Terms of Use, as posted on the Site, supersedes any other previous versions or other contracts. In addition, when using particular Services or any of Polygon’s content or material posted on the Site or elsewhere ("Materials"), or entering sections of the Site reserved strictly for members of Polygon, you shall be subject to any terms and conditions set out in policies of Polygon posted on the Site, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy, Network Rules, Code of Conduct, and other posted guidelines or rules applicable to such Services or Materials that may contain terms and conditions in addition to those in this Agreement. All such policies, guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. If you breach any of the Terms of Use, Polygon may, at its sole discretion, in addition to terminating your access to use the Site and/or any Services, limit your activity, immediately remove your item listings and/or other content, warn other members of your actions, issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your subscription and refuse to provide services to you. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Site and Materials is revoked in such jurisdictions. Polygon maintains the Site and its Services, without guarantees or warranty of any kind, for your use, and grants you the permission to use and view the Site and access its Services subject to these Terms of Use.

REGISTRATION AND MEMBER INFORMATION.
Polygon’s member Services, including certain portions of the Site, are only available to business entities that have become registered members of Polygon as described in these Terms of Use ("Members").

Changes to the fee structure shall become effective once posted on the Site and shall apply to all new or renewed subscriptions which become effective on the day of such posting. Fees paid in advance are non-refundable if you cancel your subscription prior to its term, or if Polygon restricts, suspends, limits or terminates your access to the Site or Services as a result of your non-compliance to the Terms of Use or in the case of other unpaid obligations to the trade. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with the Services and all applicable taxes.
