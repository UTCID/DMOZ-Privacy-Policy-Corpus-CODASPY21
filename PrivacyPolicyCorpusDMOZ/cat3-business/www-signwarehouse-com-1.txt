SIGNWAREHOUSE, INC. Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 5/1/2016
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how SignWarehouse, Inc. and its group companies (SignWarehouse, we, us, our) collects, uses, discloses and handles any personal information we collect from you, and how to contact us if you wish to access or correct your personal information, or ask questions about how your personal information is handled under this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time if our practices change. You may find links to other websites not operated by SignWarehouse but which are accessible through our websites.

We may use information gathered from cookies on some of our websites to deliver material that might interest you on third party websites, such as Facebook. We sometimes use a type of technology called a pixel tag on our websites or in our emails, alone or in combination with cookies. Pixel tags may be used to provide us and third parties who provide services to us with information about customer activity on our websites and/or when emails that we send are opened or accessed.

This information includes when your Personal Communication Device is activated as well as when and how you are using it. We may collect such data to verify the information you provide to us manually and to provide you with location based content. We may also associate it with your existing personal information solely for our internal use in order to improve your experience with us.
We may also use third-party companies to serve ads and marketing content to you and to measure how relevant this content is to you. These companies may use cookies and other tracking tools on our websites and third-party websites to present personalized advertisements and other messages that may be of interest to you. You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliances Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Our websites are not currently set up to respond to browser do-not-track signals, but you can configure your browser settings to reject all cookies or prompt you before a cookie is set.
