Valley Vet reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us (at your expense), and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims.
You agree not to settle any such matter without the prior written consent of Valley Vet.
Valley Vet will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Site (excluding any linked sites) is controlled by Valley Vet from our offices in the state of Kansas, in the United States of America.
It can be accessed from all 50 states, as well as from other countries around the world.
As each of these places has laws that may differ from those of Kansas, by accessing or attempting to access the Site, you and Valley Vet agree that any claim, cause of action, or dispute between you and Valley Vet will be governed by and construed under the statutes and laws of the state of Kansas, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules and the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods.
This includes, without limitation, any claim, cause of action, or dispute relating to your use or attempted use of the Site; your interactions and communications with Valley Vet; Valley Vet's collection, use, sale, disclosure, or deletion of your personal or other information; and your privacy, whether such claims are based in contract, tort, statute, equity, or other legal basis.
You and Valley Vet agree and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Kansas with respect to any claim, cause of action, or dispute.
22. Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver: Binding Arbitration
Any and all claims, causes of actions, and disputes between you and Valley Vet-including, without limitation, any claim, cause of action, or dispute relating in any way to your use or attempted use of the Site; any communication with Valley Vet; information you provide to Valley Vet; information that is collected, used, sold, disclosed, or deleted by Valley Vet; and products or services sold or distributed by Valley Vet-will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert an individual action in small claims court if your claims qualify, and so long as the matter remains in small claims court and advances only on an individual basis. Unless you proceed with a small claims action, the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law will apply to this Agreement. This Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver:
Binding Arbitration section will include any claims, causes of action, and disputes between you and the officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, suppliers, successors, and assignees of Valley Vet.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. But an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitration will be conducted in Kansas City, Kansas or Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Valley Vet may provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with us, and you must provide such notice by e-mail to service@valleyvet.com.
You and Valley Vet agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Valley Vet waive any right to a jury trial.
The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at ADR.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. AAA and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) for any claim where the total amount in controversy is less than $10,000 (ten thousand US dollars), the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or be based solely on written submissions, and the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration will be conducted by an arbitrator in Kansas City, Kansas or Kansas City, Missouri who is approved or otherwise affiliated with the AAA; (c) the arbitrator may award monetary damages, injunctive, or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim; (d) unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding; and (e) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If subparagraph (d) above is found to be unenforceable, this mandatory arbitration provision will be null and void, but the jury trial and class action waiver provisions will remain in effect.
You and Valley Vet agree that only the courts and not the arbitrator can decide issues relating to the construction, application, scope, and enforcement of this "Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver:
Binding Arbitration" section-including questions of arbitrability of any and all claims and issues, and all procedural issues.
You and Valley Vet agree that these Terms of Use will supersede any conflicting provisions in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, or any other applicable rules.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND VALLEY VET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION.
ANY AND ALL PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Any demand for arbitration governed by these Terms of Use must be made before the statute of limitations applicable to such a claim has run.
If a dispute arises, we strongly encourage you to first contact our Customer Service Department before starting an arbitration or filing a claim in small claims court.
We value our relationships with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and quickly. All claims you bring against us must be resolved in accordance with this "Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver:
Binding Arbitration" section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this "Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver:
Binding Arbitration" section will be considered improperly filed and void.
23. Other
Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Use, if any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
This is the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter.
Any failure or delay on our part in enforcing our rights under these Terms of Use will not be considered a waiver of our rights.
These Terms of Use will be enforceable by our successors and assignees.
24. Contact Us
If you have any questions or comments regarding these Terms of Use or the Site, please email us at service@valleyvet.com, or write to us at Valley Vet Supply, 1118 Pony Express Hwy., Marysville, Kansas
