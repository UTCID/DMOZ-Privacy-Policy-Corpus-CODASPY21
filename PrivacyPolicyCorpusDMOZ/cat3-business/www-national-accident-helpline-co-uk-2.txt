Excellent 4.7|19,141 reviewsWhat is compensation?Compensation is money awarded to somebody who has been involved in an accident that wasn't their fault. It's a financial settlement that covers the costs and impact your injury has had on your life, now and into your future.Personal injury compensation isn't just awarded to anybody who's been involved in an accident. To qualify for compensation, or even to start a claim you must have:Been involved in an accident in the last three yearsExperienced an accident or negligence caused by somebody elseSuffered an injuryWe have 26 years' experience helping people start their compensation claims. We know the difference compensation makes to people who have suffered genuine injuries because of someone else's negligence or reckless behaviour.Although claiming compensation can't take away what you've been through, it can help you get back to normality, get you the apology you deserve and help ease your financial pressure.If you've suffered an injury because of somebody else, we can help you take the first steps to claiming compensation.

Can you claim compensation?
Many people who get in touch with us are unsure whether they could make a compensation claim for their accident. This is completely understandable - claiming compensation can seem complicated and sometimes it's not always clear who's at fault for your accident.The easiest way to find out is to get in touch with us for free on . We're here to help and we can usually tell you on the same call whether we think you could make a compensation claim.Plus, we'll never rush or pressure you into starting a claim. Instead, we'll listen to everything you say about your accident. We'll take the time to really understand how it's impacted you and give you advice about your next step.
How is your compensation calculated?
Your solicitor negotiates your settlement based on your experience and the impact it has had on your life. Because of this, the figure you receive from your claim is completely unique to you - meaning there's no set amount for a type of injury or accident.Because of this, we can't tell you how much you could receive before you start a claim with us. But you can be sure that your solicitor will work hard to get you the full amount you're owed.Below is a list of things your solicitor will consider when they negotiate your compensation:How severe your injury is, and your recovery-timeWhether your injury will affect your life in the futureThe amount of time you've had to take off work because of your injuryAny care you've received, even if from a family memberAny adaptations to your home, car or lifeAny medical expenses, from physiotherapy to prescription costs and even travel expensesKevin's storyAs someone who loves the outdoors, Kevin struggled with being stuck at home after his injury. On top of this, taking time off work was putting him under financial pressure.With our 26 years' experience, we helped him make it right. Now he's back at work, and can go out fishing again.

Calculate your compensation
Although we can't tell you exactly how much you could claim, you can get a guideline figure by using our compensation calculator.Our compensation calculator is an online tool that asks you some questions about your experience, and then provides an approximate value of your case.It's completely free, and using it doesn't mean you have to make a claim. It's a tool to help you consider your options, and to help you understand what's taken into consideration when your solicitor puts together your case.
What's involved in claiming compensation?
We all want to know what we're getting into when we start something new. Claiming compensation is no different.Each claim is varied so we can't cover everything that might be involved in your claim, but generally the first step to starting a claim is to get in contact with us. We'll chat through your situation and let you know if we think you have a claim.Then, if you're ready, we'll put you forward to an experienced, specialist solicitor who will become your point of contact throughout your claim. They'll submit your claim, negotiate on your behalf and keep you up-to-date throughout the process.During your claim, you'll be expected to attend a free medical assessment and supply any evidence you have.Then, if your claim is successful you'll receive your compensation, or if it's unsuccessful you'll be protected by our no win no fee agreement.
What are the different types of compensation?
If it feels wrong, we're here to help you make it right - no matter what type of accident you've been involved in.Although some compensation claims are more common than others, we're able to help you make a claim for almost any accident that happened in the last three years and wasn't your fault.Read more about the types of compensation claims we've worked with by clicking on the bullet points below:Accidents at workRoad accidentsSlips or fallsFalls in public placesMedical negligenceAccidents in your homeSerious or life-changing accidents
