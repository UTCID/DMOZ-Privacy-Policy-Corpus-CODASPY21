Clever Baggers Ltd ('The Company').
QUOTATIONS  All written quotations issued are based on the Companys production costs at the date thereof and may be carried on or after the commencement of any contract with the customer to allow for any change in production costs including (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) the cost of labour materials or transport. All prices quoted for goods and services are valid for a period of 21 calendar days from date of issue, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company. Quotations for carriage and lead times are estimates and are subject to confirmation at time of placing order.
PAYMENT  All orders require payment immediately upon placing order, unless agreed in writing prior to placing your order. Production of orders will not begin until the invoice has been paid in full. Delay in payment can cause delay in the overall lead time for your order. The Clever Baggers Ltd. cannot be held responsible for failure to fulfil a delivery date as a result of late payment. Where applicable, V.A.T. is payable on all goods and services supplied by the Company. Once an order has been placed the supplied details or requirement may not be changed. Any such request may require cancellation of the original order and placing of new order. Where an amendment may be possible this will result in an administration charge, minimum £15.00 + VAT.
ORIGINATION  All orders include up to 1 hr of Studio time. Any additional time thereafter will be charged at the rate of £30.00+VAT per hour. In the event of an order being cancelled, charges relating to origination will be made in line with our cancellation policy. Where complete digital artwork is not supplied, then it is wholly the customers responsibility to ensure that any artwork provided by themselves or the Company, is satisfactory before any goods are printed. The Company will give as much professional help in advising the customer as to the suitability of the artwork but accept no responsibility whatsoever in the appearance of the design once it has been printed onto fabric.
ARTWORK APPROVAL - (Excluding orders placed through the Online Product Designer)  Prior to any order being passed to print, an electronic artwork proof will be supplied to the customer for approval. This will depict the artwork to be printed on the selected product and will show the product and print to scale. It is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the artwork proof before approving. All approvals must be made in writing. Once approved, all printing will be to the approved proof and the Company will accept no liability for any error in the artwork.
ARTWORK APPROVAL - (Orders placed through the Online Product Designer)  Orders placed using the Online Product Designer will not be subject to any additional artwork review or proofing. It is solely the responsibility of the customer to ensure correct placement and scaling of their artwork / image, and that the artwork / image supplied is of suitable quality for printing, before placing their order. The company will not accept any liability for errors or quality of print where the finished article matches the customers requested layout and supplied artwork / image.
COPYRIGHT  It is the sole responsibility of the customer to ensure that they have the legal right to reproduce the image or text as supplied. The Company shall accept no liability for any infringement of copyright law, and by submitting artwork the customer is confirming that they have a legal right to request reproduction of the artwork / image. Customers intellectual property in the form of graphic designs, photos and other digital / electronic media will be stored on secure server and will only be used in conjunction with the customers own order unless separate agreement is reached. Please refer to notes for damaged and kept (D&K) items.
TITLE - Until such time as the goods have been fully paid for, title to the goods will remain vested in the Company, who may, without prejudice to any other legal remedy, repossess any unpaid for goods. The goods will from time of the delivery be at the buyers risk.
DESPATCH  All lead times quoted indicate the estimated number of working days until despatch of your order. The lead time commences the next full working day from the date the company receive written approval of the artwork proof, or at the point of paying for your order through the Online Product Designer. All printed orders will be despatched using the delivery method selected at Checkout, all of which require a signature upon receipt. The Company will not accept instructions to leave goods without a signature. Where this is agreed with the customer and courier directly, the customer accepts full liability for the goods from that point on. Where a specific despatch date is required, this must be agreed in writing prior to placing your order and will be subject to additional charges. The Company cannot accept liability for any delays or consequential losses outside of their control. The Company cannot accept liability for delays in delivery once goods have been despatched. Customers should organise their own service to collect orders where recourse is required if a deadline is not met.
Where delivery is made to a third party, it is the customers responsibility to ensure goods are checked in accordance with stated terms and that any claims for shortage are submitted as stated.
For non-UK deliveries, customs fees (taxes, duties, processing fees, brokerage fees, etc) may be charged on delivery. Please contact your local customs office if you need to know more. These fees are not included in our shipping charge. We do not refund these fees, shipping fees or the cost of your order should you refuse to pay these additional charges. Should you return goods where additional fees have been paid, only the cost of your goods may be refunded.
SIZE  Due to the nature of manufacture, all quoted sizes are nominal and subject to a +/- 5% tolerance.
FABRIC WEAVE & COLOUR - Cloths may vary in weave and shade due to the inherent nature of the cotton fibres, their country of origin and the weaving process employed.
CLOTH COLOUR - DYED FABRICS - Whilst every effort will be made to maintain consistent standards, allowance must be made for some variation in shade of dyed fabrics, as there can be variances between dye batches. Matching will however be to commercially acceptable standards.
PRINT COLOUR VARIATION - Whilst every effort will be made to maintain consistent standards, allowance must be made for some variation in shade from panel to panel during a production run, as no two items react in identical fashion when printed. Thus, no allowance or concession will be made for prints, which are not deemed to match exactly the approved standard, or other prints in the lot being processed. Matching will however be to commercially acceptable standards.
PRODUCT CARE - Products require different care depending upon their base fibre-content, the finish and the embellishment process applied. The Company's sales team will advise upon request. Specific wash/rub/fade/shrink standards may be met subject to these being outlined when placing an order. Where a product carries no care instructions it is deemed to be unsuitable for any form of washing / cleaning.
CUSTOMERS' PROPERTY AND PROPERTY SUPPLIED - All property supplied to the Company by or on behalf of the customer will be held at customers' risk. Every care will be taken to secure the best results where materials or equipment are supplied by customers, but responsibility will not be accepted for imperfect work caused by defects in, or unsuitability of such materials and equipment.
Damaged & Kept  Unless faulty printed products are explicitly requested and at an agreed price when placing an order, print faults and seconds will be kept by the Company and re-cycled or sold as seen fit in line with current GDPR.
INSOLVENCY - If the customer ceases to pay his debt in the ordinary course of business or cannot pay his debts as they become due or, being a company, is deemed unable to pay its debts or has a winding up petition issued against him. The Company, without prejudice to other remedies shall 1) Have the right not to proceed further with the contract or any other work for the customer and be entitled to charge for work already carried out (whether completed or not) and materials purchased for the customer, such charge to be an immediate debt due to him. 2) in respect of all the unpaid debts due from the customer have a general lien on all goods and property in his possession (whether worked on or not) and shall be entitled on the expiration of 14 days notice to dispose of such goods or property in such manners and at such prices as he thinks fit and to apply the proceeds towards such debts. The construction, validity and performance of this contract shall be governed by the law of England and Wales, and any legal proceedings in relation to such contract shall be submitted in the jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales without prejudice to the sellers' right to bring any such proceedings before the Courts having jurisdiction in the Purchasers' place of residence or business.
COMPLAINTS  Please ensure that all orders are checked upon receipt. Claims for shortages must be submitted within 24 hours of receipt. Complaints relating to your order must be made to the Company in writing within 5 calendar days of receipt. The Company accepts no liability for complaints submitted other than in this manner, or in excess of this period. Complaints from third party customers will not be accepted. Claims for consequential losses relating to the purchase of goods from the Company will not be accepted. (Your statutory rights are not affected).
CANCELLATION - PLAIN ORDERS  Under CONSUMER CONTRACTS (INFORMATION, CANCELLATION AND ADDITIONAL CHARGES) REGULATIONS, retail customers are entitled to cancel your order up to 14 calendar days after receipt. You must notify the Company in writing within that period. The Company will issue refunds within 14 working days from receipt of the returned goods or proof of return. The items must be returned to the Company within 14 days of cancellation, clearly stating the reason for return. Where a complete order is cancelled, standard postage charges shall be refunded, any additional or express services selected by the customer shall be at the expense of the customer. Where only part of the order is cancelled, only the value of the cancelled goods shall be refunded. The Company cannot accept responsibility for items lost during transit and advises that customers should retain proof of postage as a minimum. The Company will not refund return postage costs. The Company reserves the right to claim for any losses in the event of goods not being returned. Any returns made outside of this policy will be accepted at the discretion of the company. Upon acceptance of the return, a refund for the value of the returned goods only, minus an administration charge of 5% of the total order value will be issued. This does not apply to any custom printed orders. Your statutory rights are not affected.
CANCELLATION - PRINTED ORDERS  Orders for printed goods may be cancelled subject to the following charges:
After placing order - All applicable origination charges (Minimum £30.00+VAT)
After printing started  Full order value except delivery costs.
PROMOTIONS & DISCOUNT  All promotions and discounts will be subject to additional terms and conditions as specified and supplied with that promotion. All orders must fully comply with the terms of the promotion in order to benefit from that specific promotion / discount.
Force majeure  The Clever Baggers Ltd. cannot be held responsible for failure to fulfil a delivery commitment as a result of situations beyond our reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, occurrences such as: Natural Disasters, Extreme Weather conditions, Labour Strikes, Congestions at Ports of Entry, Customs Delays, accuracy of information provided by client, or failure of subcontractors to perform.
The construction, validity and performance of this contract shall be governed by the law of England and Wales, and any legal proceedings in relation to such contract shall be submitted in the jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales without prejudice to the sellers' right to bring any such proceedings before the Courts having jurisdiction in the Purchasers' place of residence or business.

SIZE  Due to the nature of manufacture, all quoted sizes are nominal and subject to a +/- 5% tolerance.
FABRIC WEAVE & COLOUR - Cloths may vary in weave and shade due to the inherent nature of the cotton fibres, their country of origin and the weaving process employed.
CLOTH COLOUR - DYED FABRICS - Whilst every effort will be made to maintain consistent standards, allowance must be made for some variation in shade of dyed fabrics, as there can be variances between dye batches. Matching will however be to commercially acceptable standards.
PRINT COLOUR VARIATION - Whilst every effort will be made to maintain consistent standards, allowance must be made for some variation in shade from panel to panel during a production run, as no two items react in identical fashion when printed.

Matching will however be to commercially acceptable standards.
