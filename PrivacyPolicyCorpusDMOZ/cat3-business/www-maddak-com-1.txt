Privacy Policy
We at SP Industries know you care about how information you provide us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the Maddak Inc. web site located at www.maddak.com (the “Site”) and how we may use and share that information. By visiting our site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
In this Privacy Policy, the words “we,” ‘us” and “our” refer to Maddak Inc.

The Information We Collect
We do not collect your name, address or other personally identifiable information from you when you visit our Site unless you provide us with the information voluntarily (for example, when placing an order on our Site). We do use standard “cookie” technology to collect non-personal information to enhance your experience on our Site. Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on a user’s computer’s hard drive so that their computer will “remember” information about their visit. We also record “session information” such as information about what you have added to your shopping cart during your visit to our Site.
Sharing Your Information
We do not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties except in the ordinary course of administering our business and as required by law. For example, we may use outside service providers to deliver products you order. Any such service providers will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. When ordering products, we will ask you to specify a distributor that will be credited with your order. This distributor will have access to information regarding which products you have ordered. In addition, we may release your personally identifiable information when we are required to do so by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or whenever we believe that disclosing this information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or our safety or that of others. In the event of a sale or merger of our business, your personally identifiable information then held by us would be transferred to our successor.
