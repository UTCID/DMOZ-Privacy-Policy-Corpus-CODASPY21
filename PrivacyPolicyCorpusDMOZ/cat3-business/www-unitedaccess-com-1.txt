We hope that these policies regarding your privacy (the “Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) demonstrate our commitment to making your experience on our Web site (the “Site”) thoroughly enjoyable.Individuals must be 13 years of age or older to use this Site and you warrant that you are 13 years of age or older. By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. Therefore, you should carefully review this Policy so you understand our privacy practices.This Privacy Policy will inform you about:What information we collect from you;What “cookies” are and how they are used;Information concerning links to third party Web sites;Information for younger visitors and their parents;How we use the information we collect;Disclosure of information;The security measures we put in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information we obtain;How you may view the information we collect and update and correct the information; andRevisions to this Privacy PolicyA summary of the information we gather. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from your visit to our Site. If you choose to create an account or contact us via a form on this site, we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) that you provide such as your name, street address, phone number, and e-mail address. Please enter your information carefully as we do not have the ability to update any changed information. The PII you submit will be used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, and to notify you (if applicable) regarding any promotions.We also collect aggregate information that does not identify a specific individual. Aggregate information may include demographic information, the type of browser being used (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, etc.), the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows 7/8, or Mac OS), the number of users that visit a specific page on the Site and the character and duration of such visits. This aggregate information may be used to help analyze Site traffic and improve our services. At no point, however, will the aggregated information personally identify you.Automatically Collected Information. We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you visit the Site, our systems automatically collect your IP address, and, as referenced above, the type of browser you use. Information may be automatically collected through the use of “cookies” which are discussed in more detail below. We may also collect information about your browsing behavior, such as entry and exit points for the Site, search terms, website addresses you visit, page views, and impressions.What are cookies and how do we use them? Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit the Site. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our Site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular, to personalize the site and improve the site experience. For example, collecting this information helps us streamline your experience on the Site–for example, by remembering who you are or “automatically” filling out forms for you. We also use this information to understand changes in consumer trends and demand, and to offer products and services to interested customers and demographic groups, thus improving the shopping experience. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the Site’s features or services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.Internal Use of PII. In general, we use PII internally to serve our users or customers, to enhance and extend our customer and user relationships so our users or customers may take maximum advantage of our products and services. For example, by understanding how you use our Site from your computer or mobile device, we are able to customize and personalize your experience. More specifically, we use PII to provide services or to anticipate and resolve problems with our Site, or to respond to customer support inquiries, and to create and inform you of new products or services from United Access or others that may better meet your needs. You should review the following section to understand when United Access discloses PII to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties.The following section describes our disclosure practices more fully: Your PII may be used by us and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venturers, successors, assigns, sponsors and/or partners (“Affiliated Third Parties”) to provide you with additional services. We may also rent, sell, or share your PII with other people or non-affiliated third parties.Internal Analysis. We may use PII and aggregate information for our own internal statistical, design, or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, or measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to understand demographic, customer interest, and other trends among our users. We may also use PII to customize various aspects of the Site to your preferences. We may outsource these tasks to third parties for external analysis.External Analysis.This Site uses Adobe® Site Catalyst to help United Access measure the use of the Site or tailor our online ads based on the likely interests of our users. You can opt out of the use of Adobe cookies for these purposes by clicking here: Opt Out.Marketing Purposes: As referenced above, we may disclose your PII to both Affiliated Third Parties and non-affiliated third parties so they can inform you about their products or services. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails.Our Affiliates: PII as well as aggregate information may be shared with our Affiliated Third Parties and stored on equipment and facilities that we share with such affiliates. We will keep all information collected from this Site logically separate from other information stored by such affiliates on such equipment.Business Transfers: Information about our users and the Site is one of our most important business assets. Therefore, information about our users, including PII, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Site or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which PII would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.Protection of United Access and Others: We release PII when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to protect our rights or property, or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose any PII or aggregate information if required to do so by law, including compliance with legal process served on United Access, or if we believe that such action is necessary in order to (a) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of United Access, the Site, or its users; or (b) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of the Site’s users or the general public.Links to third party sites. The Site may contain hyperlinks to other Web sites, including sites we may not own or operate. We do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their Web sites, including their use of any information (such as IP address, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors “click through” links to their sites or view advertisements served by them. We encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.Children’s Privacy Policy. The Site is not intended for individuals under thirteen years of age. We do not permit use of the Site by anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly, directly, or passively collect information from children under age 13. If you are under 13 years of age, you should stop using this Site.Do Not Track. Our Site does not respond to browser-based, DO NOT TRACK requests.Disclosure of handles and postings. The username you select or are provided with in order to participate in certain public areas (such as bulletin boards, chat rooms, and the like) of the Site (your “Handle”) is deemed non-personally identifiable information. Your Handle may be published on the Site and may be disclosed to others, including, without limitation, to the public at large, and to any third parties with whom we elect to share such information. In addition, if you include your name or any other PII in any material transmitted or posted on public areas of the Site, such information will be published on the Site and will be disclosed to other users of the Site and to other third parties who may have access to or otherwise see a display of such information. You hereby release, hold harmless and waive any claims against United Access relating to such disclosure, sharing, or publication.Security. Our data networks are protected by advanced firewall and password protection systems. We also maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of PII in our custody and control. We also are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Site. Our security practices and policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals are granted access to the information provided by our visitors. There is no 100% guarantee of security on the Internet, however. In addition, e-mail that you send us is not necessarily secure against interception. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your user name and password. If you have to write it down, please keep your user name separate from your password.Revisions to policy. Please note that, by using the Site, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site. We may change or amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Policy. If we make any material changes to our Policy or how we handle your personal information, we will post an “update” notice to our site and change the date of the Policy. If we are going to use any PII in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the changes; your continued use of the Site subsequent to changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept the changes; therefore, please bookmark this page and review it frequently. The “Effective Date” at the top of this Agreement will assist you in determining whether you have reviewed the most current version.However, if users have opted out of all communication with the Site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will PII be used in this new manner. We will use information in accordance with the most current Privacy Policy.
