Privacy policy
General information
This privacy policy has been translated from German (company is based in Vienna, Austria) to English by Google Translate.
Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting the official website https://www.thqnordic.com (the "website") of THQ Nordic GmbH, which under this privacy policy is also referred to as "THQ Nordic", the "Company", "we" and "Us". This Privacy Policy outlines what kind of information we collect about you and how you can decide how we collect and use that information. This Privacy Policy applies in whole or in part to our subsidiaries and websites of our products.
Data protection
We have written this privacy policy to explain to you, in accordance with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which information we collect, how we use data and what options you have as a visitor to this website.
Unfortunately, it is in the nature of things that these explanations sound very technical, but we tried to describe the most important things in a simple and clear manner.
Automatic data storage
When you visit websites nowadays, certain information is automatically created and stored, including on this website.
If you visit our website as it is now, our web server (computer where this website is stored) automatically saves data such as the IP address of your device, the addresses of the visited subpages, details of your browser (eg Chrome, Firefox, Edge, ...) and date and time. We do not use this information and usually do not disclose it, but we can not rule out that it will be seen in the event of unlawful behavior.
Storage of personal data
Personal data that you submit electronically to us via this website, such as name, e-mail address, address, or other personal information you transmit in the course of submitting a form, or comments in the blog, will be used in connection with time/date of entry and your IP address and only stored for said specified purpose. This information is kept safe and will not be disclosed to third parties.
We use your personal data exclusively for communication with those visitors who expressly request contact and for the handling of the services and products offered on this website. We will not disclose your personal information without consent, but we can not rule out that this information will be seen in the event of unlawful behavior.
If you send us personal information via e-mail - i.e. outside of this website - we can not guarantee secure transmission and protection of your data. We recommend that you never send data by e-mail unencrypted.
Contact via the website
Due to legal regulations, the website contains information that allows visitors to contact our company quickly and to communicate with us directly, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If you contact the data controller (us) via e-mail or through a contact form on our website, the personal data provided by you will be automatically saved. Such personal data, voluntarily transmitted by an individual to the Company, is stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the respective person. There is no disclosure of this personal data to third parties.
Registration on our website
We offer the option of registering on our website, providing personal data. The personal data transmitted to us can be seen on the respective registration forms. This personal data shall be collected and stored solely for internal use by us and for this specific purpose. The THQ Nordic employee responsible may initiate the transfer to one or more other employees of THQ Nordic, who can in turn use the personal data, again, only for internal use attributable to the purpose of the registration.
By registering on the website, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the person submitting the data is stored, along with the date and time of registration. The reason for the storing of this data is to prevent fraudulent use of our services. In case of need, the storage of this data enables us to investigate criminal activities. In this respect, the storage of this data is required to legally protect data processors. Essentially, a disclosure of said data to third parties is not intended, unless there is a legal obligation to share it, or if the data needs to be forwarded as part of a criminal prosecution.
By registering, said voluntarily provided personal data enables the internal data processor to provide the registrant with content or services that, due to the nature of the case, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to modify the personal data given at registration at any time or to delete it completely from the database of the data processor.
The internal data processor shall, at any time upon request, provide information to each registrant as to which personal data about the registrant is stored. Furthermore, the data processor corrects or deletes personal data at the request or reference of the registrant, insofar as this does not conflict with any statutory storage requirements. All team members of the data processor are available to the registrant as a contact person in this context.
Data protection in the case of job applications and in the application process
The data processor collects and processes the personal data of job applicants for the purpose of handling the entire application process. The processing can also be done electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant submits corresponding application documents to the data processor by electronic means, for example via e-mail or via a contact form on the website. If the Company concludes a contract of employment with an applicant, the data transmitted will be stored for the purposes of the employment relationship in accordance with the law. If no contract of employment with the candidate is concluded by the Company, the application documents will be automatically deleted six months after receipt of the application, provided that deletion does not conflict with any other legitimate interests of the Company. Other legitimate interest in this sense, for example, a burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act (GETA).
Your rights
In principle, you have the rights to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, revocation and objection. If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or if your data protection claims have otherwise been violated in a way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the Data Protection Authority whose websites you can find at https://www.dsb.gv.at/.
TLS encryption with https
We use https to transfer data securely on the Internet. By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission over the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data. You acknowledge the use of this security of data transfer at the small lock symbol in the upper left corner of the browser and the use of the https scheme as part of our Internet address.
