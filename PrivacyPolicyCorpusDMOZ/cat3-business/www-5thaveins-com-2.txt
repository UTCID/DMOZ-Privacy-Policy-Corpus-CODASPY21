operates 5thaveins.com and may operate other websites. It
is 5thaveins's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.Website VisitorsLike most website operators, 5thaveins collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 5thaveins's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how 5thaveins's visitors use its website. From time to
time, 5thaveins may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.5thaveins also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on 5thaveins.com
blogs/sites. 5thaveins only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.Gathering of Personally-Identifying InformationCertain visitors to 5thaveins's websites choose to interact
with 5thaveins in ways that require 5thaveins to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 5thaveins gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at 5thaveins.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 5thaveins are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, 5thaveins collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
5thaveins. 5thaveins does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.Aggregated Statistics5thaveins may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. 5thaveins may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, 5thaveins does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as

only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on 5thaveins's behalf or to provide services available
