Privacy Policy
This Web
site is the responsibility of NicheInvestments LLC, a Colorado company
(the "Company"). The Company can be contacted by
mail, by phone, or by e-mail. The following policies apply to
the Web Site having the URL https://www.mhbay.com which is owned
and operated by the Company.
1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors
The
Company automatically collects and/or tracks the following: (1)
the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client
computer, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Company's
web site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate
with the Company via e-mail, post messages to the Company's
bulletin boards, or post messages to the Company's chat groups,
(3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online
forms, registrations forms, surveys, and contest entries, and
(4) aggregate and/or user-specific information on what pages are
visited within the Company's Web site.
The
Company may from time to time place Internet "cookies" on
visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies contain identifying
information about the user which can only be accessed by The
Company's servers. When the visitor revisits the Company's Web
site, the Company will recognize the visitor by the Internet
cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly.
Internet cookies are stored on the visitor's hard drive and are
not stored, in any form, by the Company. Visitors may decline
the Internet cookie by using the appropriate feature of their
Web client software, if available.
When a
visitor performs a search on the Company's search engine, the
Company records information identifying the visitor or linking
the visitor to the search performed. As necessary to provide
service, the Company does record limited information for every
search request and uses that information only to solve technical
problems with the service and to calculate overall usage
statistics.
2. Use of Personal Data Collected
The
Company's registration form requires users to give us contact
information (such as their name and e-mail addresses), financial
information (such as their account or credit card numbers), and
demographic information (such as their zip code, age, or income
level). The Company uses customer contact information from the
registration form to send the user information about the Company
and promotional material from some of the Company's partners.
The customer's contact information is also used to contact the
visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may
want to contact the Company's visitors. Users may opt-out of
receiving future mailings. Financial information that is
collected is used to check the users' qualifications for use of
the various services offered by the Company, to bill the user
for products and services, and for other purposes. Demographic
and profile data is also collected by the Company. The Company
uses this data for other purposes. Personal data collected by
the Company will be used by the Company for editorial and
feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a
statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product and
services development, for content improvement, to inform
advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on
their advertisements, and to customize content and layout of the
Company's Web site. Data on visitors' home servers is aggregated
for internal review and then discarded. Names, postal and e-mail
addresses, and phone numbers collected may be added to the
Company's databases and used for future calls and mailings
regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming
events, and status of orders placed online.
3.Disclosure of Data to Third Parties
In
connection with the utilization of the Company's Listing
Services, user's contact information (name, address, telephone
number, fax number, e-mail) will be provided on the Company's
Web Site. Any third party other than these users to which the
Company shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal
data of subscribers to its services will be carefully
pre-screened by the Company, determined by the Company to be
reputable, and will use the personal data for marketing products
and services which the Company determines, in its sole judgment,
that visitors might find of interest.
4. Opt-Out Right
Visitors
may opt out of having their personal information collected by
the Company, used by the Company for secondary purposes,
disclosed to third parties, or used by the Company or third
parties to send promotional correspondence to the visitor, by
contacting the Company via postal mail, e-mail, or telephone, or
by checking the appropriate box on the online forms. However, if
the Company has provided a user's information to a Third Party,
and subsequently receives an "opt-out" request from a user, it
will cease its own contact with the user but may not be able to
cause the Third Party(s) to stop its contact.
5. Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data
Upon
request via postal mail, e-mail, or phone, the Company will
provide to visitors a summary of any personal information
retained by the Company regarding the visitor. Visitors may
modify, correct, change, or update their personal record or
cause their personal record to be removed from the Company's
database. The Company will only send personal records to the
e-mail address on file for the visitor name associated with it.
6. Collection of Personal Data from Children
The
Company will not collect or post information from children. The
Company's Web Site is designed for adults over eighteen (18)
years of age.
7. The Company's Right to Contact the User
The
Company reserves the right to contact site visitors regarding
account status and changes to the membership services agreement,
privacy policy, or any other policies or agreements relevant to
site visitors.
8. The Company's Right to Change Privacy Policy
The
Company reserves the right to change this policy at any time by
notifying visitors of the existence and location of the new or
revised privacy policy.
