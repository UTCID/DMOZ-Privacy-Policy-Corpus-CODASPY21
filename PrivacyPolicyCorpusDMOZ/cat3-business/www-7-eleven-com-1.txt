Choices for Access, Deletion, Opt-Out of Sale, and Right to Non-Discrimination for California Residents or As Required by Law:
If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information we collect, disclose, and “sell” about you (as that term is defined in the CCPA). Additionally, you have the right to access, delete and opt out from the “sale” of your personal information.
To exercise these privacy rights and choices, please follow the instructions below:

How to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information: We offer an opt-out from the use of cookies and other tracking technologies in connection with our Services, which may in some cases constitute the sale of your personal information under the CCPA or other privacy laws. To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, please click Do Not Sell My Personal Information or fill out this webform at the 7-Eleven Privacy Rights Portal. This will cause information to cease to be added to any cookies or other tracking technologies that have been set on our Services or block them entirely.

If you maintain an Account with us, we will verify your identity through existing authentication practices for the Account (e.g., login and password). If you are not a registered member, we will verify your identity by matching two or three data points that you provide with data points that we maintain and have determined to be reliable for the purposes of verification (e.g., browser or device ID or purchasing history).
Authorized Agents:
You can use an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf but we may require the agent to be registered with the California Secretary of State (for CA residents) and verify his/her identity or demonstrate that he or she has power of attorney in connection with a request for access or deletion.

You have the right to be free from discrimination in product quality, goods or services if you choose to exercise your privacy rights under the CCPA.

Do Not Track Signals:
7-Eleven does not respond to Do Not Track signals to the extent received from a web browser. Because there currently is not a universally accepted technological or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals as reflections of user choice, we do not respond to them at this time. Once such technology is created and has received applicable regulatory approval, we will consider (a) whether it is possible; and (b) if so how it can be incorporated within 7-Eleven’s environment in the future.

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request this information once per calendar year by contacting us at privacypolicy@7-11.com.
