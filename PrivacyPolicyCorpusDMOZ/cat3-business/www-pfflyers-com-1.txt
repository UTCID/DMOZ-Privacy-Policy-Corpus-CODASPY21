HOW DO YOU SHARE MY INFORMATION?
Third Party Service Providers: For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer your Personal Information to our third party service providers who use that information only to conduct PF Flyers business. For example, these third party service providers may handle PF Flyers credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, information analysis, promotions management and other services for PF Flyers. We provide our preferred service providers with the Personal Information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your Personal Information.
Aggregated Data: We may use your Personal Information that is aggregated and no longer personally identifiable for purposes such as reporting and marketing and we may disclose aggregated information to various third parties.

We may also share Personal Information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide Personal Information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
Cooperative Databases: In connection with the distribution of our print catalogs and other marketing materials, we participate in cooperative data sharing databases. The participants of these databases provide customer names, mailing addresses and information about their customers' purchasing history to the database vendor which allows the database participants to segment and/or obtain access to potentially interested parties to which they may wish to target their own promotions.
If you prefer not to have your name, email address and mailing address released to these cooperative databases, please let us know by sending an e-mail to CustomerCare@pfflyers.com.

To enable these companies to provide you with targeted recommendations and other communications, we may provide these companies with certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, address and email address, as well as your transaction history. These companies may use data about you in order to provide recommendations for products and services that might be of interest to you. If you wish to opt-out of this program, please let us know by sending an e-mail to CustomerCare@pfflyers.com.
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy or with your prior consent, we will not sell, trade or rent Personal Information to other companies as part of our regular course of business.

If that happens, your Personal Information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect.
WHAT ABOUT INFORMATION THAT I POST TO BLOGS AND OTHER PUBLIC AREAS OF THE SERVICE?
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by PF Flyers through means other than the Service. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide through the Service or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and/or other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information").

You should exercise caution before you post Personal Information that you post in public forums.
Once you release your Personal Information for posting on public forums, PF Flyers cannot and will not be responsible for the privacy and/or security of such information.
HOW DO I KNOW MY PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SECURE?
We have a variety of security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Information that we have collected from you from the Service. To ensure the information you provide online is secure during transmission, we use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) while processing any Personal Information you supply.
These controls are certified by DigiCert®. You can review our security certificate using your browser by clicking on the closed lock or solid key image at the bottom of your browser on any of the secure pages on our site. This will display our Service security information.
Our Service provides you the ability to store your credit card number in the "My Account" section of our Service. To protect your security, we encrypt all stored credit card numbers and we do not store your card's CCV number. For others, we may temporarily store the entire encrypted credit card number when it is necessary to manually contact a credit card company for verification.
WHAT ARE COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND PIXEL TAGS? HOW DOES PF FLYERS USE THEM?

WHAT IS THE PF FLYERS CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY?
We do not knowingly ask for Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 (a "Child").

While PF Flyers’ policy prohibits children under 13 from registering with the Service, parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other Personal Information without parental permission.
