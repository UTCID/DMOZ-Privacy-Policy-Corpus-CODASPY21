Ibec's Privacy Statement
Ibec Trade Association and Policy group websites
Ibec trade associations and policy groups are peopled by Ibec members in specific sectors and areas of economic activity. Each trade association and policy group operates within and is managed and administered by Ibec while retaining its own separate identity and purpose. Ibec is therefore the data controller for each of the listed Ibec managed websites.
IBEC PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT
1. Types of information collected by Ibec
We collect and further process two types of information:
"Personal Data"
This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you and may include your name, address, e-mail address, user IP addresses in circumstances where they have not been deleted, clipped or anonymised and telephone number. Such information is only collected from you if you voluntarily submit it to use and we use it to deliver Ibec services and information to you. Ibec collects personal data in the following circumstances.
Under the Ibec membership contract member organisations are asked to nominate named contacts in their business/ organisation with whom Ibec may communicate with to provide Ibec services. These contact details are collected on a business to business basis and the legal basis for such data protection is to facilitate the necessary performance of the membership contract.
In addition, member companies may provide employee details to Ibec when seeking training services from Ibec.
Other personal data processed by Ibec are for attending Ibec events and training courses, and communicating with policy, media and other stakeholders with whom Ibec communicates as part of its role as a lobby organisation.
We will also have supplier contact details which will contain individual names.
In addition, Ibec processes personal data of employees.
The Ibec websites are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

Like most websites, we gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our website. This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding, for example, user IP addresses where they have been clipped or anonymised, browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website.

Members
Ibec uses member contact and other relevant personal information to provide membership services to member companies. These services, and any personal information given to enable their provision, are provided under the Ibec membership contract.
It is core to Ibec membership services that Ibec communicates with its members to keep them informed and up to date on what we are doing on their behalf and to seek their views and input (including membership surveys) on issues of relevance.
While Ibec member interactions are business to business, they contain - principally via member contact details - some personal data. The relevant legal basis for processing any such personal data in Ibec member communications is contractual and membership necessity.
Ibec relies on its legitimate interest as a business representative organisation to represent its members and also to provide information on a range of lobbying and policy development issues and initiatives to officials (national, European and international), commentators, media, trade unions, other employer representatives and other similar stakeholders.
Ibec provides information, training and events to non-members who enquire, generally via the website in the first instance. Non-members may also contact Ibec via the phone or via personal interaction with an Ibec staff member. Non-members includes individuals attending Ibec training or events in their personal capacity. We rely on consent and contractual necessity for those communications.

Employer Relations Division
The Ibec employer relations advisory service processes personal data only in so far as is necessary to advise and represent the member employer. Ibec ensures by its management and internal policies and employment obligations, that the Ibec staff processing that personal data are committed to confidentiality. There are access controls in place to ensure that; relevant staff members within the employer relations division have access to case files and general files and that confidentiality is respected and maintained within the division.
Ibec data retention procedures ensure that the information is kept for no longer than is necessary.
Ibec does not generally engage third-party contractors to assist with employer relations advice and representation however if and when it does so it will ensure it has sufficient contractor guarantees on data privacy protection.
Trade associations
Ibec manages over 40 trade associations. Communications with and within these trade associations are business to business communications but will also involve the name and other contact details from member organisations individual nominees, expert advisers and suppliers as well as contact details for media, policy and other relevant stakeholders. These contact details are used for member interactions, member to member networking, lobbying, and information and project development. Trade association contact details will be reviewed annually by each trade associations and are deleted where no longer relevant or necessary to keep.
Employees and Job candidates
If you apply to work with Ibec we will use the personal data you give us during the recruitment process and will retain it for one year after your recruitment process ends unless otherwise obliged by law to retain it. We will only share it with our recruitment agencies and contractors if they are party to the process and to check references with third-parties nominated by you. We may keep de-personalised recruitment statistics for our own internal purposes but none of this data will identify you.
Events
When you attend an Ibec event, we will need your name, email address, payment information and, in some cases, your dietary preferences. This information is necessary and used by us in organising and administering the event. We delete event attendance data within a maximum of 14 months (and maybe less depending on the event).  If the event is an annual event we will hold your contact details to let you know when it is next being held. We normally handle Ibec events ourselves but individual Ibec trade associations occasionally use event managers who are GDPR compliant. Where this happens, we ask those external event managers to display their privacy statement to those with whom they interact with on Ibec's behalf. If you are a speaker at an Ibec event, we will publicly promote your involvement via Twitter, LinkedIn, media interviews, emails and webinars. This data may continue to be processed by those platform providers after the event has ended.
Training
Ibec provides management training programmes to members. We also provide and manage training programmes and initiatives which are funded in part by or provided to the State which are open also to non Ibec members. Ibec training programmes may involve other third-party contractors to Ibec or maybe provided in association with other programme operators. Where this happens Ibec will have an agreement in place with the other third party which will honour and protect the data privacy rights of training participants. These rights are set down later in this privacy statement.
3. Disclosure of information to third parties
We may provide Non-Personal Data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. For example, we occasionally inform third parties - usually sponsors of Ibec events and initiatives - of the number of unique users who visit our websites, the demographic breakdown of our community users of our websites, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website.
We will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties unless you have consented to our doing so. We will, however, disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that we are required to disclose it in order to comply with any applicable law, a summons, a search warrant, a court, workplace relations forum, regulatory order, or other statutory requirement.
