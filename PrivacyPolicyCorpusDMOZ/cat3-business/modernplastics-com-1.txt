1. OVERVIEW
Modern Plastics (“Modern Plastics,” “us,” or “we”) respects the privacy of users of our website and its related services.
The following privacy policy (the “Policy”) tells you about the information that Modern Plastics collects through the Services and how we may use or disclose that collected information.
By accessing the Services, continuing to access the Services, purchasing any products or services through the Services, downloading and/or using the Application, or submitting any information through the Services, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us, as described below. Your use of the Services is also governed by the Terms of Service all of which are to be expressly incorporated and included as part of this Policy.
Registration Forms
Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (like name, email and postal address). Contact information from the registration forms is used to ship purchases, information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer’s contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary and to share with other companies who may want to contact our customers.
Order Forms
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products and services. We collect contact information (like email address). Contact information from the order forms is used to ship purchases, information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer’s contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary, and to share with other companies who may want to contact our visitors.
Modern Plastics routinely contacts its suppliers, partner companies and co-workers and collaborates with them for fulfilling your quotes and other requests in a variety of formats (i.e. e-mail, phone, extranet and intranet sites, etc.). These are “typical business conversations” and they should be expected during the normal course of business operations but are no way intended to divulge information that is not pertinent to our customer’s request for quote or other requests.
Companies and individuals who e-mail prints, patent pending design information, proprietary materials, requests for quotes, and other requests, do so knowing that this information is subject to such conditions. Customers and companies that require strict confidentially should send Modern Plastics non-disclosure statements that will only be valid when signed by the President of Modern Plastics. E-mail the forms, in Word format, to NDA Form – we will promptly e-mail back you a signed company (pending legal review).
Security
This site and our company Modern Plastics, have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Modern Plastics uses e-mail extensively and hence maintains the latest anti-virus software and software updates to prevent spreading viruses to our customers and prospects.
From time to time, certain viruses may infiltrate our system and the possibility exists that customers in our database could receive a virus from a user at Modern Plastics. We realize this is a risk that we also face in accepting e-mail and one that our customers and prospects face, however it is a risk which we accept and one which all users assume when e-mail conversations take place between our companies.
Modern Plastics assumes no liability for the transmission of a virus to its customers and/or prospects from our e-mail servers. Modern Plastics strictly limits the distribution of passwords and access to its most critical components of its website – customer information.
