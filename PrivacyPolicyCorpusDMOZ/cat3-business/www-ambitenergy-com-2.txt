Violation of These Terms of Use
Ambit Energy may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Ambit Energy’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Ambit Energy’s customers. Ambit Energy reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Ambit Energy deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Ambit Energy also may disclose your information when Ambit Energy determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.
You acknowledge and agree that Ambit Energy may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Ambit Energy through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Ambit Energy determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Ambit Energy, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.

You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Ambit Energy, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Ambit Energy obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Ambit Energy deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Ambit Energy may have at law or in equity.
You agree that Ambit Energy may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.

You agree that Ambit Energy will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.
Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
You agree, by visiting or using the Site, that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of laws provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims, you agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Dallas County, Texas, and hereby consent to, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Ambit Energy and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.

Ambit Energy administers and operates the www.Ambit Energy.com Site from its location in Dallas, Texas, USA; other Ambit Energy sites may be administered and operated from various locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Ambit Energy reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature, product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.
Miscellaneous
You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export laws and regulations.
If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Ambit Energy with regard to your use of the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Ambit Energy with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Ambit Energy, Ambit Energy will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Ambit Energy’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by Ambit Energy of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Ambit Energy and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.
