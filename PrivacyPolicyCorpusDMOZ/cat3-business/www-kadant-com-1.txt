This includes instructions relating to processing payments, delivering packages, analyzing website or mobile application usage data, electronic and postal mail service, marketing services, social media services, and calculating, managing, and reporting sales tax.
If any personal information is provided to third-parties outside the EEA or who will access the information from outside the EEA, we will ensure approved safeguards are in place, such as the approved standard contractual clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield. Examples of where these safeguards are in place include where we provide your information to our subsidiaries and divisions for our legitimate business purposes or to our trusted third-parties who provide the types of services mentioned above. All our subsidiaries and divisions sign standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to safeguard the personal information transferred across our businesses to and from the EEA.
We will disclose your personal information if required by law, regulation, or as part of a legal process. If we receive a request from a regulatory body or law enforcement agency, and if permitted under GDPR and other laws, we may disclose certain personal information to such bodies or agencies.
If Kadant is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and may share or transfer your personal information to the new owners of the business or company or their advisors.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We work hard to protect Kadant and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit.
We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
We restrict access to personal information to Kadant employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
While no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, we strive to protect the information submitted to us. We consider the sensitivity of the personal information we collect, process, and store and use the appropriate technology to protect your personal information. We cannot, however, guarantee its absolute security.
YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS
Individuals in certain countries, including the EEA, have certain rights in relation to their personal data. For example, you have the right to request access to your personal information, the right to have a machine-readable copy of your data, the right to correct or update your personal information, and the right to have all your personal information deleted. You also have the right to object to our processing activities, as summarized below.
If you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights as described above, you may contact us at privacy@kadant.com.
COMPLIANCE AND COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers
We use servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this Privacy Policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to transferring data.
European requirements
If GDPR applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this Privacy Policy so you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information. You may also object to the processing of your information at any time for marketing purposes or where we rely on our legitimate interests.
We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on these legal grounds:
With your consent. We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you may withdraw your consent at any time.
When pursuing legitimate interests. We process your information for our legitimate interests while applying safeguards that protect your privacy. This means we process your information for things like:
Providing, maintaining, and improving our websites to meet the needs of our users
Developing new products and features
Understanding how people use our websites to improve the performance of our websites
Marketing to inform users about our products
Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our websites and
Protecting against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Kadant, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
When entering into or performing a contract. We process your data to provide a product or service you have asked for under a contract or when you have asked us to sign a contract.
When complying with legal obligations. We will process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we are responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.
If you have questions about our legal basis for processing information, you may contact us at privacy@kadant.com. You can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law or would like to file a complaint.
LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
Our websites contain links to social networking and other websites and mobile applications operated and controlled by third-parties. Unless otherwise stated, any personal information you provide to any third-party website will be collected by that party and not by us and will be subject to that party’s privacy policy rather than this Privacy Policy.
COOKIES
We use “cookies” and other similar technologies (e.g., internet tag technologies, web beacons, and embedded scripts) to help provide you with a better, more personalized user experience. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use these technologies to help us understand and improve how visitors use our websites, including which pages and products are viewed most frequently.
Our websites may include web beacons and cookies from third-party service providers. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third-party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. Because your browser connects to those third parties' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties can set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.
You have a variety of tools to control cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, including browser controls to block and delete cookies and controls from some third-party analytics service providers to opt out of data collection through web beacons and similar technologies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Google Chrome, you can block or delete cookies by clicking Settings > Show advanced settings > Content settings > Cookies. In Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by clicking Settings > Privacy > Cookies. Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies in other browsers may be available in each browser's privacy or help documentation.
Please note that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to use certain site features and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
CHILDREN
We do not intend to solicit or collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, do not enter information into this site or engage in our services.

Unless otherwise noted, any changes we make to this Privacy Policy will become effective immediately once posted on this page. Your continued use of our websites following any changes to this Privacy Policy indicates your consent to the practices described in the revised Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our Privacy Policy applies to all information we have about you and your account.
