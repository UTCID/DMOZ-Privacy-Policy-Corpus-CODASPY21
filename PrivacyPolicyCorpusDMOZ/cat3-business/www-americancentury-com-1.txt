Our Use of Web Analytics
We use third party tools to track the usage of our website. Tracking information does not include any personally identifiable information. Cookies, which are set on behalf of American Century Investments, report this data so we can better understand our users and to improve our site. American Century Investments does not honor "do not track" requests. However, we will not use targeting cookies or similar tools that transmit your data to third parties for advertising purposes unless we receive your consent first.
Our Use of Cookies & Clear Gifs
If you conduct business with American Century Investments online, you may notice our use of Internet cookies. Cookies enable our systems to recognize your browser and customize your experience on our website and help us better understand how our investors use our website.
What Is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of alphanumeric information placed on your computer by the website you are visiting. It allows the website to remember or recognize your computer during subsequent visits. Although websites use cookies for different purposes, one important function is to allow a site to personalize your experience. For example, cookies help us better understand how account owners use our website so we can improve your online experience. Once you are logged in, cookies maintain your security as you move from page to page within the site.
What Types of Cookies Do Websites Put on My Computer?
Temporary: Cookies that are stored on your computer only during your browsing session, and are automatically deleted from your computer when you close your browser. No information is collected from your computer.
Persistent: Cookies that are stored on your computer and are not deleted when you close your browser. Permanent cookies retain your preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to remain for future browsing sessions. No information is collected from your computer.
How Does American Century Investments Use Cookies?
We use cookies to facilitate your use of our website. These cookies do not collect or contain any personally identifiable information. Examples of how we use cookies include:
Temporary Cookies
All Secure Pages: American Century Investments and Pershing, our clearing agent for brokerage customers, use temporary cookies on all secure pages. These cookies store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to you, allowing you to move from page to page without having to log in repeatedly.
Persistent Cookies
All Pages: These cookies are set by Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and/or Eloqua to help us analyze online behavior and identify areas of the site where users are having difficulty completing a task. We use this information to help build a better website.
Brokerage Model Portfolio: This cookie is set by Pershing to collect browser information for use with their Model Portfolio service. It allows you to access your Model Portfolio during subsequent visits.
Home Page: This cookie is set by American Century Investments and allows customers to bypass the corporate homepage when they indicate a preference for a section of the site they would like to view on future visits.
What Is a Clear Gif and How Are They Used?
A clear gif, also known as a Web Beacon, is similar in function to cookies. It is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier that is invisible on the page and much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs track online web movements of our users and inform us what content is effective. Clear gifs do not transmit users' personal information.
In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know when they have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to understand the effectiveness of our communications and tailor future emails to meet user needs.

Protecting your privacy and security is a shared responsibility. We affirm our commitment to safeguard your personal information; however, it is imperative that you protect your Password to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you do not share your Password with anyone. If you do choose to give it to someone, such as a so-called "financial aggregator" that combines information about you from multiple sources over the Internet, you do so at your own risk. We cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur as a result.
