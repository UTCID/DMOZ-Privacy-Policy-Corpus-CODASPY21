Tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes, including but not limited to the use of any device to automate the entry process, is prohibited and any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be void. In the event a dispute regarding the identity of the individual who actually submitted an entry cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected entry will be deemed ineligible. FOX assumes no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.
RANDOM DRAWING FOR EACH SWEEPSTAKES
Refer to entry page for actual entry dates (i.e. beginning and end dates). A winner is randomly selected once per month at the end of the month (“Drawing Date”). All valid email addresses subscribed to the Newsletter List prior to the Drawing Date will be combined into a single pool, and from that pool one potential winner will be selected. A potential winner will be notified at their email address on the Drawing Date. Sponsor shall have no liability for any winner notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a potential winner for any reason. If, despite reasonable efforts, a potential winner does not respond within 24 hours of the first notification attempt, or if the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit his or her prize and an alternate winner may be selected.  FOR CANADIAN RESIDENTS ONLY: Prior to being confirmed as a winner, a potential winner will be required to correctly answer a mathematical skill-testing question provided by the Sponsor.  If any potential winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules (including, but not limited to, for residents of Canada correctly answering the skill-testing question) or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected, time permitting, in the sole discretion of the Sponsor. If there is still no confirmed winner(s) of such applicable prize after any such attempt has been made, such prize may not be awarded.
Your email address must be added to the Newsletter List before Drawing Date to be considered for that month’s Sweepstakes. Any email address that is added after a potential winner is selected for a Drawing Date will be included in the next month’s Sweepstakes. You can remove yourself from the pool of eligible participants by unsubscribing from the Sweepstakes OR by unsubscribing from the Newsletter List. The unsubscribe link can be found at the bottom of any newsletter from FOX OR follow this link to unsubscribe from the Sweepstakes.
PRIZE FOR EACH SWEEPSTAKES
Prize may vary by month. Refer to entry page for actual prize information, including a description of the prize and the approximate retail value (“the Prize”). The randomly selected and confirmed winner will receive one (1) Prize only.   Each individual entered into the Sweepstakes can only win one Prize.  For the avoidance of any doubt, if you have won a Prize then you will remain on the Newsletter List (unless you subsequently unsubscribe) – but will no longer be eligible to win any additional Prize(s) in any Sweepstakes.  No substitution or transfer of any Prize or election of cash in lieu of any Prize by the winner will be permitted.
