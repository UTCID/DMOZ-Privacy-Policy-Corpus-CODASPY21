HAI Group® is a marketing name used to refer to insurers, a producer, and related service providers affiliated through a common mission, management, and governance. Property-casualty insurance and related services are written or provided by Housing Authority Risk Retention Group, Inc.; Housing Authority Property Insurance, A Mutual Company; Housing Enterprise Insurance Company, Inc.; Housing Specialty Insurance Company, Inc.; Innovative Housing Insurance Company, Inc.; Housing Investment Group, Inc.; and Housing Insurance Services, Inc. (DBA Housing Insurance Agency Services, Inc. in NY and MI). Members of HAI Group provide commercial property and casualty insurance to affordable housing organizations, public housing authorities, and related entities. Not all products are available in all states. Coverage is subject to the terms of the policies actually issued. A risk retention group or surplus lines insurer may provide certain coverages. Risk retention groups and surplus lines insurers do not participate in state guaranty funds, and insureds are therefore not protected by such funds if insured by such entities. For a complete list of companies in the HAI Group family, visit www.housingcenter.com.
