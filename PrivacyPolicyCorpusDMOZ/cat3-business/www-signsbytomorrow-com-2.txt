THESE ARE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING YOUR USE OF THE AFB SITES (DEFINED BELOW) AND OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW).
Welcome to the Internet website(s) available at and under www.allegramarketingprint.com and the related or linked websites of our Centers (defined below) (collectively, the “AFB Sites”) developed, hosted, maintained or operated by Alliance Franchise Brands LLC (“AFB”), its affiliates, subsidiaries or designees. In this Terms of Use Agreement (this “Agreement”), AFB or such affiliates, subsidiaries or designees are referred to collectively as “we,” “us” or “our.” This Agreement, which includes the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy (available at signsbytomorrow.com) and any Additional Terms (defined below), sets forth the terms and conditions governing your use of the AFB Sites and your access to and use of the webpage, sub-pages, URLs, links, the Marks (defined below), copyrights, information, other content and services offered on or through the AFB Sites (collectively, the “Services”). The Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.  Except as otherwise indicated, any reference herein to the “Agreement” shall include the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms.
Please carefully review the Privacy Policy, the Additional Terms and this Agreement before accessing or using the AFB Sites or the Services. By accessing or using the AFB Sites or any of the Services, you accept and agree to be legally bound by this Agreement, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time by us. Further, certain areas of the AFB Sites, including, without limitation, access to franchisee only areas, or product or service ordering services, may require registration and/or be subject to additional terms and conditions of use; and we will provide you with notice of such additional terms and conditions on your registration.
IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE AFB SITES OR USE THE SERVICES.
1. We Reserve the Right to Revise this Agreement. We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to update, revise, supplement and to otherwise modify this Agreement, the Privacy Policy and the Additional Terms and to impose new or additional rules, policies, terms or conditions on your use of the AFB Sites or the Services. Such updates, revisions, supplements, modifications and additional rules, polices, terms and conditions (collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Additional Terms”) will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement upon our publishing them on the AFB Sites, and we will update the effective date of this Agreement. If the revisions are significant, a notice will be posted prominently on the AFB Sites to notify you of such revisions.  You are responsible for reviewing this Agreement each time you use or access the AFB Sites or use the Services. Your continued use of any of the AFB Sites or the Services following such notice will be deemed to conclusively indicate your acceptance of any and all such Additional Terms. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, Sections 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of this Agreement shall survive any such termination.
IN THE EVENT OF ANY INCONSISTENCY OR CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PRIVACY POLICY AND/OR ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, THE FOLLOWING ORDER OF PRECEDENCE SHALL CONTROL: (A) THIS AGREEMENT; (B) THE PRIVACY POLICY; AND (C) ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS.
In addition, offers or coupons made available on the AFB Sites might be subject to additional terms and conditions provided in conjunction with the offer or coupon.  We will provide these terms and conditions to you or post them on the offers or coupons to which they apply.
2. We May Discontinue the AFB Sites or the Services at any time.  We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the AFB Sites or the Services, with or without notice to you. This includes the right to modify, discontinue or remove any content, postings, links, pages, services, or other materials at any time and for any reason. You agree that we will not be liable to you for any modification, general suspension or discontinuance of any AFB Sites or the Services. We may refuse or restrict anyone from access to any or all of the AFB Sites or the Services at any time.
3. Centers are Independent Contractors. If you are accessing any of the AFB Sites that are particular to a franchised or licensed Center, which engages in the operation of a sign design and graphic sales business using our proprietary system and Marks pursuant to a franchise agreement (each a “Franchise Agreement”) with us (“Centers”), you understand and agree that: although we may host, develop, maintain or operate the AFB Sites on behalf of the Centers, the Centers are independent contractors operating as separate legal entities under Franchise Agreements with us. If you are accessing this Agreement from one of these Centers’ websites, you recognize that we are merely operating as a third party service provider providing advertising services to the Center and are not, by operation, hosting, maintaining or developing the Centers’ websites, nor are we such Centers’ partners, joint venturors, principals, employers, employees or agents. Centers are not our agents or employees. Centers do not have any right to speak for us or on our behalf, or bind us to any contracts or obligations. We are not responsible for any of the acts or omissions of Centers.

By “commercial purposes,” we mean any activity by you, on your own behalf or on behalf of any customer, for consideration.  If you are a Center, any use of the AFB Sites or the Services by you constitutes a commercial purpose and your use of the AFB Sites or the Services are governed by your Franchise Agreement with us and this Agreement.

Without limiting any of our rights or your obligations under this Agreement, you may not, and by using the Services or an AFB Site you agree not to, use the Services or an AFB Site to: (i) transmit material that is copyrighted, unless you are the copyright owner or have obtained the permission of the copyright owner to transmit it; (ii) transmit material that reveals trade secrets, unless you own them or have the permission of the owner to so transmit them; or (iii) transmit material that infringes on any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) of others or violates the privacy or rights of publicity of others.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Intellectual Property Rights” means, collectively, rights under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and any other intellectual property or proprietary rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction worldwide, including, without limitation, moral rights and similar rights.
(k) Ownership. The trademarks, trade names, logos, color schemes, service marks, slogans, and similar means of identifying products or services displayed on any of the AFB Sites, including without limitation, any variation of the term or phrase “Allegra®” (collectively, the “Marks”) and other Intellectual Property Rights are our or our licensors registered and/or common law marks or other Intellectual Property Rights. All content and materials on the AFB Sites including, without limitation, the Marks, button icons, images, audio clips, and software, copyrights, patents and other Intellectual Property Rights included in the Services or an AFB Site, are our property or our licensors’ and are protected by United States and international copyright, patent, trademarks, and other proprietary rights and Intellectual Property Rights laws. The compilation of all content on the AFB Sites is our exclusive property and is protected by United States and international copyright laws. All software used on the AFB Sites is our property or our licensors’ property and is protected by United States and international copyright laws. Except to the minimum extent otherwise expressly permitted under copyright law, no copying or exploitation of material from the Services or on an AFB Site is permitted without the express prior written permission of us and any other applicable copyright owner. You may not copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, sell, distribute, transfer or modify any of the content, data, information or materials found on the AFB Sites, but you may download, display and print one (1) copy of the content displayed on the AFB Sites on a single computer for your personal-non-commercial use (see Section 4(a) above). You will not use the Marks or other AFB Site content on any site, website, web page, portal, or on any form of advertisement which you operate, authorize or control without our express prior written permission. You may not use our Marks or copyrighted materials in any search engine descriptions, content, meta-tags, “white lettering”, key words, or other means of directing or influencing web traffic to any website, web page, portal or e-mail operated, controlled or authorized by you without our express prior written permission and your doing so constitutes a violation of our rights under United States federal and state law, and other international laws and is a breach of this Agreement. You will not adopt or use any names, trademarks, slogans, trade names, trademarks, service marks, e-mail addresses, URLs, meta-tags, key words, search descriptions or the like that are the same or are confusingly similar to the Marks. Without our prior written consent, you will not submit or maintain any information submitted to search engines which incorporates any content from the AFB Sites, the Marks, our copyrighted materials or any marks that are confusingly similar to the Marks. Unless you are a Center franchisee or licensee in full compliance with your Franchise Agreement and other related agreements with us, you also may not resell the Services (or any part thereof) without our prior written consent. If you wish to do so, contact us at datagov@alliancefranchisebrands.com to determine if we will grant you prior written permission to resell the Services or use the Marks in such manner. If you wish to access AFB Sites or use any of the Services, copyrighted materials or the Marks for commercial purposes in any way, contact datagov@alliancefranchisebrands.com to discuss establishing a commercial relationship with us and find out if we will grant you prior written permission to do so. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership or license rights by virtue of downloading the Marks or copyrighted material from the Services or an AFB Site. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are expressly reserved to us. If you believe your rights under applicable copyright laws are being infringed, you may notify us in accordance with the instructions set forth in Section 16 hereof.
(l) Use and Access Outside the United States.  The AFB Sites are hosted in the United States and back up servers may be located outside of the United States.  If you visit from the European Union or other foreign jurisdictions, please note that (a) we make no representations or warranties that the information, products or services contained on the AFB Sites is appropriate for use or access or is available in other jurisdictions; and (b) these jurisdictions have laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law.  You should be aware that if you transfer Personal Information to us through the AFB Sites or the Services, you are transferring such information to the United States and the United States does not have the same data protection laws as the European Union and some other regions. By providing Personal Information to us, you consent to the transfer of it to the United States and the use of it in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
5. We May Provide Third Party Content on the AFB Sites.  We may occasionally provide third party content or link to third party websites on the AFB Sites. Such websites are not under our control and we explicitly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy, content or availability of the information products, and/or services found on or through such websites. We do not endorse and have not taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information, products or services contained on or through such websites. We do not make any representations or warranties as to the security or use of any information (such as credit card and other sensitive information) you might provide on or through any such websites.  If applicable, you should review the third parties’ terms of use and privacy policies before you use their services.
6. Submissions. If you do post or send us any comments, suggestions, information, ideas, concepts, knowledge, techniques, content, or materials (collectively, “Submissions”), and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant us and our agents, representatives, co-branding partners, franchisees and licensees (collectively, the “AFB Parties”), a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display the Submissions, for any purpose, including developing, manufacturing or marketing products and/or modifying or improving the AFB Sites or the Services, throughout the world in any media. You grant the AFB Parties, and any of the AFB Parties’ sublicensees, the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such Submissions, if the AFB Parties choose.
7. Compliance with Laws. You may use the Services and the AFB Sites only for lawful purposes. The Services and use of the AFB Sites are subject to, and you agree that you will at all times comply with, all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances and the like applicable to the use of the Services and the AFB Sites. This obligation includes your agreement to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules relating to the export of technical and other data from the United States (and from your country if you are not located in the United States) and your agreement not to export or re-export any such data or any other content or materials in violation of such laws, rules or regulations without first obtaining all necessary licenses, consents and approvals therefor, as well as authorization from us.
8. Your Access to Certain Services. As a convenience and courtesy to you, in addition to the Services offered to the general user of the AFB Sites, we may provide you access to certain AFB Sites for purpose of contracting with us or Centers to sell products or services to you. If we do so, any offers or sales made in connection with the use of such AFB Sites will be subject to our purchase policies and this Agreement. You acknowledge that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by the agreements into which you thereby enter. Pursuant to any applicable statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or other laws, including without limitation the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, P.L. 106-229 or other similar statutes, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, APPLICATIONS AND OTHER RECORDS AND ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED THROUGH THE AFB SITES. Further, you hereby waive any rights or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or other laws in any jurisdiction which require an original signature or delivery or retention of nonelectronic records, or to payments or the granting of credits by other than electronic means. You may obtain a copy of this Agreement by printing it now.  In addition, you understand that certain Services on the AFB Sites such as a general contents page and a current information page (which provides information that may include, without limitation, news of interest to users of the AFB Sites, shipper information and other Services) may include materials and information from third parties, and you acknowledge and agree that we have minimal control over such information.
