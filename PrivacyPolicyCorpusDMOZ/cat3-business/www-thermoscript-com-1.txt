POS & Fax
Excellent printability, great durability and very good runability in thermal printers make thermoscript grades ideal for POS and fax applications. Our very light and thin grades, as well as our phenol-free grades are particularly suited to the POS sector.
Medical
In medicine it is essential that important results can be reproduced accurately and the paper used is very durable. Thermoscript satisfies the requirements of extreme durability, immaculate print head behaviour, excellent printing results and suitability for ultra high-speed printers.
Lottery & Gaming
Our thermoscript products for lottery and gaming satisfy many demands. High sensitivity, best pre-printability, optimum resistance properties and reliable security are essential. The ticket could just be the entrance ticket to a world of big wins.
Transport
Whether boarding pass, train ticket or parking ticket - thermoscript grades are used throughout the transport sector for their excellent stampability, printing image stability and durability as well as printability. Also in mobile printing. And with security features already incorporated at the mill.
Admission Tickets
Our papers for the most colourfully printed admission tickets are of the best quality. Excellent printability on front and reverse sides and extreme stability and durability are critical. Security features already incorporated in the base paper give maximum protection against counterfeiting.
Banking
High-quality, stable and extremely durable thermal papers are required for use at ATMs, multifunction terminals and statement printers. Thermoscript papers have been tested and approved by OEMs for numerous systems.
Labels & Tags
Thermal labels and tags place high demands on the material. The printed image must be sharp so that it can be read correctly by scanners. The paper must be resistant to moisture, temperature fluctuations and plasticizers.
Security
The composition of thermal paper can only be copied at great expense in any case. Our security elements such as coloured centre, coating marks or fluorescent fibres are integrated in the base paper. The paper is thus virtually forgery proof. A key argument in a variety of applications.
Further information and downloads regarding our thermoscript thermal papers can be found here.Salessales.mpemitsubishi-paper.comDirect thermal printing is a contactless printing process which uses heat transfer. A large number of small heating elements are mounted over the entire width of the thermal print head. This means that a thermal printer has very few moving parts and therefore requires very little maintenance. The heating elements transfer heat directly to the thermal paper and there, the functional layer of the thermal paper reacts with a pigmentation creating a printed image.
Additional coatings on the front and back can protect the thermal coating from environmental influences and optimize the properties of the product for specific requirements such as printability, lamination, durability etc. Of course, as well as text and graphics, all types of barcodes can be printed. Simple, reliable and fast.
Advantages of thermal printing:Low noiseReliableFastEasy to useLow operating costs (maintenance and energy saving)No other consumables such as toner or inkCompact printing unit, thus particularly suitable for portable handheld devicesCan be used under extreme climatic conditions
