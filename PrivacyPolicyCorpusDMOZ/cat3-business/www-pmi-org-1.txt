“Work Product” means materials developed specifically for Buyer and delivered to Buyer by Supplier as deliverables under a Contract.
CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTATION AND PRIORITY
The relationship between Buyer and Supplier shall be governed by the following contractual documentation, in descending order of priority:
(a) the Purchase Order, incorporating the TCP,
(b) the Statement of Work, if any, be incorporated into the Purchase Order, collectively forming the Contract;
(c)
a written agreement, if any, between Buyer and Supplier with respect to Supplier's provision of the Goods or Services, including any authorized amendments or attachments thereto, which by authorization of the Parties forms a part of the Contract (the "Agreement").
Where a conflict exists between the terms of the Purchase Order incorporating the TCP, (and as applicable, a Statement of Work) on the one hand, and the terms of an Agreement on the other, the terms of the Purchase Order incorporating the TCP (and Statement of Work, as applicable) shall govern.
The TCP expressly govern and limit Supplier's acceptance to the terms of the Purchase Order. Any different or additional terms contained in any proposal or agreement provided by Supplier, or response by Supplier to these TCP or to the Purchase Order issued by Buyer, are void and do not form a part of the Contract unless they are expressly accepted in a written amendment or addendum to the Contract, signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Supplier's written acknowledgement or acceptance of Buyer's Purchase Order, or commencement of performance thereunder, constitutes Supplier’s acceptance of all of the TCP, without modification. No amendment or addition to or modification or waiver of the Purchase Order or any provision of the TCP shall be binding upon Buyer or Supplier unless it is in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties.
PURCHASE ORDERS
Supplier may accept a Purchase Order by written acknowledgment or by commencing performance thereunder. Supplier’s commencement of performance of a Purchase Order shall be deemed an acceptance by Supplier of all terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Order.
PRICES AND FORM OF PAYMENT
The prices reflected in each Purchase Order shall be fixed, firm and definitive. Each Purchase Order shall clearly delineate those purchases which are for a fixed fee and those which are payable based on time and materials, which in the latter case shall include hourly rates and an estimate of total and not to exceed hours to complete performance. Buyer and Supplier hereby acknowledge that there is no index or formula pricing. The price stated in the Purchase Order shall be understood as including all items which make up the cost of the Goods or Services subject to the Purchase Order including, without limitation fees, insurance, consumable goods, Supplier's raw materials or third-party costs, transport, packing and labelling, accessories, devices, necessary tools, any type of expenses, payments for intellectual property, costs deriving from inspections, tests and other certificates specified in the Purchase Order, exchange rates, sales, use or excise tax, duties or import fees or tariffs.
INVOICES
Unless otherwise specified in the Purchase Order, Supplier shall invoice Buyer for delivered Goods or Services on the first (1st) day of each month following the month in which the Goods or Services were delivered, or on the next working day whenever the first day of the month falls on a weekend or federal holiday. Invoices shall specify the Purchase Order number under which the Goods or Services were purchased. Invoices shall be accompanied by any other supporting documentation reasonably requested by Buyer. No invoices shall be processed for Goods or Services which do not comply with the requirements of the Contract. Unless otherwise stated in a Purchase Order, payment to Supplier shall be net forty-five (45) days of Buyer’s receipt of an undisputed invoice.
TIMELY DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS AND SERVICES
Unless otherwise specified in the Purchase Order, delivery of Goods shall be Delivery Duty Paid ("DDP") to the location indicated by Buyer. Supplier shall provide, upon delivery of Goods, a delivery note showing the Purchase Order number, quantity, price, part number, date of delivery, and, where appropriate, any remarks and any other documentation referred to in the Purchase Order. Title and risk of loss to Goods (including Goods supplied as part of Services) shall pass to the Buyer upon Delivery. Delivery of Goods or Services shall take place at the moment the inspection sheet is signed by Buyer's designated employee, but such delivery shall not confer acceptance of Goods or Services by Buyer. No inspection, test, delay or failure to inspect or test, or failure to discover any defect or non-conformance shall relieve Supplier of any of its obligations or prevent a subsequent rejection of Goods or Services by Buyer.
The delivery dates specified in any Purchase Order or delivery schedule shall be of the essence. Supplier shall immediately notify Buyer in writing of any incident or cause which prevents delivery of Goods or Services on the dates scheduled, specifying the reason for delay and if possible the estimated revised delivery date. If Supplier fails to so notify Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to compensation for any additional actual, substantiated costs or expenses incurred by Buyer that could have been avoided if Supplier had properly notified Buyer. Supplier shall, at no extra cost to Buyer, take all necessary actions (including overtime work, urgent freight etc.) to reduce the delay period to a minimum and to mitigate the impacts thereof to Buyer. Whenever Supplier, for reasons not attributable to a force majeure event, does not meet the established delivery date for Goods or Services, Buyer shall be entitled to receive liquidated damages, notwithstanding and in addition to all other remedies available to Buyer, at the rate of two percent (2%) of the value of the delayed Goods or Services for each complete week of delay up to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the total value of the delayed Goods or Services. If delay in delivery is such that Buyer is entitled to maximum penalty and if the Goods or Services still are not delivered, Buyer may terminate the Contract or Purchase Order in whole or in part without penalty.  In no event shall Buyer be prevented from exercising termination rights under this TCP during any delay period.
All of Supplier’s work shall be subject to acceptance by Buyer. Unless otherwise set forth in a Purchase Order or Contract, the acceptance period shall be thirty (30) days from Buyer’s receipt of the Goods or Services. Supplier’s Goods and Services will be accepted if they meet the requirements of the Purchase Order or Contract. Unless otherwise set forth in a Purchase Order or Contract, acceptance procedures will be as follows: (i) Fixed Fee Goods and Services: Following Buyer’s receipt of Work Product, Buyer will verify, in its reasonable discretion, that each item of Work Product conforms in all material respects to the specifications set forth in the applicable Contract.  Acceptance of Work Product that meets such specifications shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned by Buyer; (ii) Time and Materials Services Engagement: When payment for the Services is on a time and materials basis, Services will be deemed accepted upon performance, provided that Supplier’s underlying Services are compliant with the professional services warranty as set forth in the Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, acceptance does not preclude or waive any future warranty claim by Buyer; (iii) Constructive Acceptance. If Services or Work Product are provided on a time and materials basis, with acceptance upon performance, or another acceptance right upon performance or delivery is set forth in a Purchase Order or Statement of Work, Buyer’s acceptance of Supplier Work Product shall be deemed to have occurred if Buyer does not: (a) notify Supplier to the contrary in writing within thirty (30) days from the date the Work Product was delivered to Buyer, and (b) specify in reasonable detail all deficiencies and nonconformities in the Work Product of which Buyer knows or should know through reasonable inspection following Buyer’s inspection of each item of Work Product.
BUYER-SUPPLIED MATERIALS
Whenever it is expressly agreed that Buyer will provide certain of its materials, components or content necessary for Supplier to perform under the Contract (the "Buyer Materials"), Buyer shall retain sole title to such Buyer Materials. As applicable, Buyer provides to Supplier a non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid, worldwide, revocable license to use Buyer Materials exclusively for performance of the Contract. Supplier shall carry out all actions necessary to safeguard Buyer's title to such Buyer Materials, especially in the event of any bankruptcy procedures involving Supplier, and Supplier shall waive any rights of defense arising from a bailment. Supplier represents that no third party or financial institution has the right to encumber the consigned or licensed Buyer Materials as of conveyance and at any time when Materials are in possession of Supplier. If Supplier requires Buyer Materials from Buyer in order to provide Goods or Services, Supplier must request such Buyer Materials sufficiently in advance to allow Supplier to meet the agreed upon delivery schedule. Supplier shall establish the controls necessary to maintain custody and the integrity of the Buyer Materials. Supplier shall store the Buyer Materials at its own cost, mark the same as the property of Buyer, and keep them separate from other materials or products. Risk of damage or loss to the Buyer Materials shall pass to Supplier upon delivery to Supplier.
WORKS MADE FOR HIRE FOR BUYER
Any written, visual, auditory or other materials in any format, including without limitation any and all forms of electronic media, that Supplier delivers to Buyer as, or intrinsic to, or included with the Work Product, inventions and processes, products or services held as trade secrets, inventions for which applications for patents may be filed in any country, or written data and software and any other works of authorship that are protectable by copyright, shall be considered "works made for hire" within the meaning of applicable United States law.   Works made for hire will include without limitation all original works of authorship prepared or developed by Supplier for Buyer, such as data, notes, technical information, business information, specifications, drawings, records, computer program enhancements and software code and related documentation. All such Work Product will be the exclusive property of Buyer and Buyer shall be the sole owner of any and all copyrights, patent rights and other intellectual property rights in such Work Product. If by operation of law any such Work Product may not be considered as works made for hire, Supplier hereby assigns all right, title and ownership interest in the Work Product to Buyer. Supplier agrees to execute such documents of assignment as Buyer may reasonably request to evidence, perfect or affect the transfer, recordation or protection of such Work Product. Supplier shall not make the Work Product available to any third party. Notwithstanding the above, any proprietary tools, techniques, processes, materials, systems, generalized ideas, concepts, know-how, methods or skills, in any format, which Supplier possessed prior to initiating work on a Buyer Contract, or that otherwise are intrinsic to Supplier’s business, or that is provided in the same or substantially similar form to multiple customers of Supplier (“Supplier IP”), shall be and remain the sole property of Supplier. Supplier hereby grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, world-wide, permanent, fully paid license to use, copy, modify, sublicense and display such Supplier IP as the same are incorporated into Supplier’s Services and Work Product for Buyer. As applicable, Supplier will disclose to Buyer the Supplier IP that will be used in or with the Work Product delivered to Buyer and will clearly delineate any instances where Supplier IP will be used with, but not be included in the Work Product. Further, Supplier will identify to Buyer instances where it is embedding or using third party intellectual property in or with the Work Product delivered to Buyer, including without limitation software, open source tools, commercial tools, frameworks, accelerators, or libraries.
QUALITY
Supplier shall be responsible for the quality of the Goods or Services delivered to Buyer, regardless of whether Supplier manufactured or executed them itself or acquired them from a subcontractor. Goods and Services shall conform to the requirements set out in the documentation, drawings, specifications and regulations provided to Supplier and referred to in the Purchase Order or Statement of Work. No technical modifications shall be made without the prior written consent of Buyer. Buyer shall notify Supplier in writing of any quality non-conformity detected by Buyer or its customers in Goods and Services supplied by Supplier. Supplier shall promptly respond to a non-conformity report or similar document issued by Buyer and shall promptly investigate and inform Buyer of the cause of the nonconformity and the corrective measures taken to correct it. Any other changes shall be notified in writing to Buyer for information purposes.
SERVICE LEVELS
As applicable, in the case of digital Services, platforms or tools requiring Supplier support, and unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, Supplier shall abide by Buyer’s minimum Service Level Requirements, located at www.pmi.org/SLA.
SUPPLIER PERSONNEL
Supplier shall provide competent and qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to perform the Services required by each Contract. Supplier personnel shall perform such Services in accordance with the terms of the Contract. Supplier personnel performing the Services on Buyer’s premises shall comply with Buyer’s rules and regulations pertaining to security of and access to Buyer’s premises and facilities of which Supplier has been informed in writing. Buyer reserves the right to review background, qualification and geographic location information with respect to any Supplier personnel assigned to work on Buyer matters, and Supplier shall provide such information in full upon request. Buyer retains the right to have Supplier personnel removed upon reasonable written request.
SCOPE CHANGE AND CHANGE ORDERS
Buyer may request changes that affect the scope or duration of the Services. If Buyer requests such a change, or if Supplier notifies Buyer of issues or circumstances beyond the applicable scope of Services that may require a change, then the Parties shall negotiate promptly and in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment in the applicable scope, fees or deadlines.  Unless Buyer directs Supplier to stop work pending acceptance of such change, Supplier shall continue work pursuant to the existing Purchase Order or Statement of Work, and no change shall be implemented unless accepted in writing by both Parties. Any and all such changes once agreed to and signed by the Parties will be reflected in written Change Orders or addenda to the applicable Purchase Order or Statements of Work.
WARRANTIES
In addition to any warranties made by Supplier in its brochures, catalogues, sales materials or other documentation, Supplier represents and warrants to Buyer that: (i) the Goods or Services it provides to Buyer are free from any defect in design, workmanship, raw material or manufacture; (ii) the Goods  or Services conform to the specifications, drawings, samples or other descriptions applicable thereto; (iii) any Services are performed in a professional and workmanlike manner; (iv) any Goods are merchantable; (v) the Goods are new and of quality, unless otherwise specified by Buyer; (vi) Supplier has conveyed to Buyer good and unencumbered title to the Goods or Services; and (vii) the Goods or Services comply with applicable local, state, federal laws and international legislation, and domestic industry-recognized standards currently applicable to such Goods or Services. The term of such warranty (the "Warranty Period") shall be as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order or, if not so specified, one (1) year from the date of delivery of the Goods or Services to Buyer.
If during the Warranty Period any of the Goods or Services delivered by Supplier do not meet the warranties specified herein or otherwise applicable, Buyer may, at its option, (i) require Supplier to correct any defective or non-conforming Goods or Services at Supplier's expense; (ii) if Supplier fails to timely correct any defect or nonconformity, correct such defect and charge the expense of such correction to Supplier; (iii) obtain a refund from Supplier for any defective or non-conforming Goods or Services and return such Goods or Services to Supplier at Supplier's expense; or (iv) obtain cover Goods or Services and charge the additional costs incurred in obtaining such cover Goods or Services to Supplier. Such remedies are in addition to other remedies available to Buyer at law or equity and are not exclusive. Any warranties made by Supplier shall run to Buyer and be freely assignable to Buyer's successors, affiliates, assignees, financing parties, and customers without any requirement for Supplier's consent. Supplier shall assign warranties made by other parties on or before the commencement of the Warranty Period, including its vendors and suppliers, to Buyer to the fullest extent permitted by contract and applicable law.
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS
The relationship of Supplier to Buyer is that of an independent contractor. Nothing contained in these TCP or any Statement of Work or other Contract document shall create an agency or employer-employee relationship between Buyer and Supplier. Supplier's employees shall not be considered employees of Buyer for any purpose. Supplier represents and warrants that it abides by all applicable laws with respect to its employees, and agrees that it shall be solely liable for any breach of its contractual or legal responsibilities to its employees, agents, suppliers or subcontractors, including without limitation legal or contractual requirements relating to health and safety requirements, immigration rules and documentation, worker's compensation, wage and hour, non-discrimination, benefits and insurance obligations.
INSURANCE
In the event that Supplier, its employees, agents, or subcontractors enter the facilities or offices of Buyer or its customers for any reason in connection with a Purchase Order, then Supplier and its subcontractors shall procure and maintain for the duration of the performance of the Purchase Order worker's compensation, employer's liability, comprehensive general and commercial liability, including bodily injury and property damage insurance, and property damage insurance for any equipment that may be brought to Buyer’s facilities, in no less an amount than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) of coverage per incident with respect to the general and commercial liability policies.  In addition, and as applicable, Supplier is required to maintain appropriate levels of Technology Errors and Omissions Liability Insurance and Commercial Blanket Bond, including Electronic & Computer Crime or Unauthorized Computer Access Insurance commensurate with the type of data it secures under the Contract.   Consultant shall provide certificates of insurance or other acceptable written proof of coverage to Buyer upon Buyer’s request. All policies will keep reasonable limits according to the risk of the activity and any third party requirements, and be provided by insurance companies of a reputable solvency. Supplier shall name Buyer as an additional insured and include a waiver of subrogation against the Buyer when the additional insured status is forbidden by law, for the duration of the Purchase Order. Insurance maintained pursuant to this clause shall be considered primary as respects the interest of Buyer and is not contributory with any insurance which Buyer may carry.
MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION
Supplier and Buyer each shall defend, indemnify and hold the other and its directors, officers, employees, assignees, agents, and affiliates harmless from any and all claims, demands, suits, obligations, liabilities, damages, losses and judgments, including costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorney's fees), arising from actions or omissions of the indemnifying party, its employees , agents , contractors, suppliers or other representatives that include, cause or relate to: (i) the death or bodily injury to any person or damage to property on account of: (a) any alleged or actual defect, whether latent or patent, in any Good or Service provided hereunder, or (b) the actual or alleged negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnifying party or any agent, employee, subcontractor or consultant thereof; (ii) the indemnifying party’s actual or alleged infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or misappropriation of any trade secret, or infringement of any other intellectual property right; (iii) any claims or liabilities for royalties, liens or any other encumbrances on the Goods or Services supplied; (iv) any actual or alleged violation of the data confidentiality, privacy or security requirements of the Contract; or (v) any actual or alleged breach of a party’s contractual or legal obligations to its employees, agents, consultants or subcontractors.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Buyer and Supplier each agree to keep confidential all non-public information provided by the other party which the receiving party knows or reasonably should know to be confidential or proprietary information or documentation of the disclosing party, including without limitation information related to a party’s finances, business plans, strategic plans, customers, products in development, employees, or vendors (collectively, "Confidential Information") The Parties may disclose Confidential Information to those employees, agents or subcontractors with a need to know in order to fulfil obligations under the Contract or any Purchase Order; provided that the Parties shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality obligations by such employees, agents or subcontractors. In the event that a Party is requested or required in legal, regulatory or other administrative proceedings to disclose any Confidential Information, the Party receiving the request shall promptly notify the other Party of such request or requirement prior to disclosure so that the disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order, or waive compliance with the terms of this clause, as applicable.
DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Supplier represents and warrants that it maintains appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of its customers’ data, including without limitation personally identifiable information and other sensitive data. Supplier affirms that it meets or exceeds the required administrative, physical and technological security safeguards for the type of data Supplier processes under this Agreement. Supplier further represents and warrants that it is in compliance with the requirements of all applicable data protection laws in connection with its provision of Goods or Services. Supplier agrees to comply with the requirements of Buyer’s Data Protection Agreement for data processors located at www.pmi.org/privacy/DPA with respect to Supplier’s processing of any and all data either containing personally identifiable information of an individual, or that could be used to determine the identity of an individual, when Buyer is the data controller and the data subjects include any employee, agent, customer or prospective customer of Buyer.
FORCE MAJEURE
Neither Party shall be deemed to be in default of any provision of these TCP, or any Statement of Work, nor be liable for any delay, failure in performance or interruption of services, resulting from acts of God, embargoes, quarantines, civil or military authority, civil disturbance, insurrection, war, other catastrophes or any such other cause beyond its reasonable control; provided, however, that each Party shall exercise reasonable efforts to remedy or mitigate any delay or impediment to performance to the best of its ability. The Party claiming a force majeure event shall notify the other Party of such event within five (5) calendar days of its commencement. Such notice shall describe the force majeure event, its estimated duration, its estimated impact on the notifying Party's ability to perform under the Contract or Purchase Order, and the measures the notifying Party proposes to adopt to resolve or to mitigate the adverse consequences arising from the force majeure event. Whenever a force majeure event occurs, the timing for performance under the Contract or Order shall be extended for a period equivalent to the duration of the force majeure event, except that if the force majeure event persists for more than sixty (60) days or it is or becomes apparent that the force majeure will persist more than sixty (60) days, the Party not affected by such event shall be entitled to terminate the Contract or Purchase Order by notifying the other Party. Additionally, Buyer shall be entitled to terminate the Contract or Purchase Order within less than sixty (60) days after the commencement of a force majeure event if it becomes apparent, within Buyer’s sole reasonable judgment, that the Contract or Purchase Order will fail of its original purpose and the value of the Goods or Services to Buyer will be materially reduced as a consequence of a force majeure event that cannot be remediated or resolved promptly.
SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these TCP or any Purchase Order shall be declared illegal, void or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and valid. The Parties shall replace any clause which is declared invalid or void with another valid clause which is as similar as possible to the original in terms of purpose and effect.
TERM AND TERMINATION
These TCP shall remain in effect during any time when Supplier is providing Goods or Services to Buyer. Except as otherwise set forth below, these TCP shall expire according to their own terms upon provision by Supplier of the last of any Goods or Services to Buyer.
Buyer or Supplier may totally or partially cancel the Contract or a Purchase Order, without incurring any cost, by providing written communication to the defaulting Party within thirty (30) days of the non-defaulting Party’s notice of the defaulting event, in any of the following cases: (i) material breach by the defaulting Party of the Contract or Purchase Order; (ii) whenever the defaulting Party becomes unincorporated or is declared bankrupt, insolvent or in receivership; (iii) any legal situation which limits the capacity of the defaulting Party to manage or dispose of its assets and which negatively affects its compliance with its obligations under the Contract (including but not limited to being unable to pay its debts, passing a resolution for its winding up or a court of competent jurisdiction ordering the party to be wound up or dissolved, the appointment of an administrator of or the making of an administration order or the appointment of a receiver or an administrative receiver).
Buyer may totally or partially cancel the Contract or Purchase Order, without incurring any cost, by providing thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to Supplier in any of the following cases: (i) whenever, in the sole opinion of Buyer, delays in the manufacturing, assembly or delivery of Goods or Services could prevent Supplier from meeting the delivery times, quality levels, requirements or material project deadlines specified in the Contract; (ii) Buyer has determined in its sole judgment that the Goods or Services do not meet expected standards of quality or efficacy; (iii) in the event that there is a material change in Buyer’s strategy, business plan, market assessment, risk assessment, financial condition, or other change which in Buyer’s sole judgment requires termination of the Contract or Purchase Order; (iv) the event of a "Change of Control" of Supplier. For the purposes of this Clause "Change of Control" means the likelihood of one or more persons acting together taking the control of Supplier so that, in the reasonable opinion of Buyer, its interests are adversely affected. Such "Change of Control" shall take place when, after the direct or indirect acquisition of Supplier, Supplier belongs to the same group as the acquirer or acquirers of its shares according to applicable law.
ASSIGNMENT
Either party may assign a Purchase Order or Contract with the prior written consent of the other party. An assignment without such consent shall be void.
NO GRATUITIES OR COMMISSIONS
Supplier understands that Buyer prohibits its employees, contractors and representatives from accepting gifts from Suppliers and prohibits its Suppliers from offering anything of material value to Buyer employees, contractors and representatives, as well as to third parties, in connection with its provision of Goods and Services to Buyer. Supplier represents and warrants that it, including its agents, subcontractors or other representatives, has not given and will not give any material gift or gratuity, nor has it agreed and will not agree to pay any commission, bonus or other payment, nor provide anything of material value, to any of Buyer's employees, agents or representatives, nor to any third party, in connection with any Purchase Order or Contract. In the event of any breach of the foregoing provisions, Buyer may terminate the relevant Contract or Purchase Order and recover from Supplier any losses suffered by Buyer as a result of (i) such termination and (ii) the breach of any obligation under this paragraph, whether or not the Contract or Purchase Order has been terminated.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Buyer considers observance of human rights and non-discrimination laws to be a key component of its and its suppliers' corporate social responsibilities. Accordingly, Supplier undertakes: (i) not to admit to employment, directly or indirectly, anyone below the minimum age as defined in the International Labour Organisation Convention No.138 (ILO); (ii) not to apply, directly or indirectly, forced labor or any means of labor under duress; (iii) not to apply, amongst its employees, physical punishment, threats of violence nor any other means of duress or physical or mental abuse; and (iv) to avoid any kind of unlawful discrimination against or among its employees, meaning any distinction, exclusion or preference giving rise to duress or inequality based on race, color, sex, religious belief, political opinion, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability or any other personal, physical or social condition, or other status protected by law. If Supplier is found to be in breach of any of the foregoing provisions, Buyer shall take the measures it considers appropriate, including the suspension or termination of the Purchase Order or Contract.
COMPETIVENESS
Supplier will use its best efforts to assure that all Contract Goods and Services remain competitive in terms of current technology, design, and quality and price with similar goods available to Buyer up to the date of delivery. If, in the sole opinion of Buyer, any such items do not remain competitive as defined above, Buyer, to the extent it is free to do so, will notify Supplier of the area(s) in which other goods are more competitive. If, within thirty (30) days, Supplier does not agree to timely sell such items with comparable technology, design or quality or, if applicable, at a competitive price, Buyer may terminate the applicable Purchase Order and purchase the applicable items from another supplier without liability to Supplier.
NOTICES
Any notices to be given by either Party to the other may be done by personal delivery or by mail, registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested.  Mailed notices shall be addressed to the Parties at the addresses appearing in the applicable Purchase Order. Notices delivered personally shall be deemed communicated as of the date of actual receipt; mailed notices shall be deemed communicated as of three (3) days after the date of mailing. For purposes of this Agreement, "personal delivery" includes notice transmitted by fax or electronic mail, provided sender maintains confirmation that the notice was properly transmitted on that date.

The following provisions specifically shall survive the expiration or termination of these TCP, the Contract or a Purchase Order: Prices and Form of Payment, Warranties, Environmental Requirements, Indemnification, Confidential Information, Privacy, Applicable Law and Jurisdiction, and Proprietary Rights.
APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
Supplier's provision of Goods or Services to Buyer shall be governed by and shall be construed, interpreted and enforced according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to choice of law principles thereof.  The Parties hereby consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of Pennsylvania over any dispute arising under these TCP, the Contract or an Order.
