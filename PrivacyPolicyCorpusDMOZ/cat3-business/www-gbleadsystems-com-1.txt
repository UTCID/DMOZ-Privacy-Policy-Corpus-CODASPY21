Who We Are
WTPowers has developed and licenses a system software product called WTPowers which allows
Network Marketers to promote a legal and ethical network marketing opportunity and/or Client program and/or
opportunities or programs of their choice.
The WTPowers system is designed to be used exclusively to
promote the products and Services offered by the system.
However, due to the fact that each WTPowers
account is controlled by an independent representative, we cannot guarantee how the system and privacy information
will be managed by these representatives.
WTPowers operates and manages the WTPowers System to assist network marketers in the building of
their business on the Web.
Individuals that subscribe to the WTPowers System do so in one of two forms:
prospects (sometimes referred to as Pre-Enrollees), and Members. Individual subscriptions to the WTPowers
System are referred to as a "Member" in the WTPowers System.
To cater to both you (the Customer) and our Members, we may be required to collect, use, and share certain
information.

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties
to create a profile of our users.
A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users
that details their viewing preferences.
Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally

used to tailor a user.s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.

REASON WITH ANY OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENROLLMENT IN

Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user.s computer tied to information about the user.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.
Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
See the .Profile. section.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs, CSS, and similar functionality)
We employ or our third party advertising company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users. personally identifiable information.
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company.
That means, for example, that if a person visited .www.companyX.com., which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site or advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or Web site.
In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just "surfing".
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
All of our users. information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.
When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users. information is protected.
