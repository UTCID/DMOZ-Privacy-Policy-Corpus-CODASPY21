Any unauthorized use of the Site or its Information is prohibited.
Product and Pricing.
The product and pricing information supplied on this Site is provided for your convenience only. It does not constitute an offer to make a sale. Your order will be treated as an offer to purchase, which will be subject to acceptance by the Company. Terms will be as expressly agreed by you and the Company. Product information changes from time to time and may, on occasion, include inadvertent errors (typos and misprints). Please contact the Company to confirm product and pricing information. The Company disclaims any liability for typographical errors, misprints and other mistakes or omissions. The availability, product descriptions and product prices of any products sold on the website are subject to change at any time without prior notice. Product prices are subject to change from time to time without prior notice. Product prices do not include shipping and handling fees or sales taxes. Shipping and handling charges will be added to your order. We may be required to collect sales tax from you and, if required, will add sales tax to your order. Orders must include current, valid credit card information. By submitting an order to purchase products through the Site, you authorize us to charge to the credit card identified in your order the price for all products purchased in the order, plus all applicable shipping and handling charges and taxes.
Order Acceptance.
All orders submitted through the Site are subject to acceptance by the Company and an electronic confirmation of order receipt may be issued. Confirmation of order receipt does not constitute acceptance of your order. An order may be accepted in a written acceptance or by processing payment for or fulfilling the order.
Shipping.
In some instances, the Site has arranged for product vendors to ship products directly from their locations to purchasers. If you order products supplied by different vendors, products will be shipped to you separately from either the Site or from the respective vendor locations. Products will be shipped only to locations in the United States; provided, however, that shipments to locations outside the United States may be arranged by contacting the Company. The Company will have no responsibility for fulfilling orders that cannot be shipped because of incomplete or inaccurate billing or shipping information.
Risk of Loss.
Risk of loss and title for products purchased from the Company pass to you upon delivery of products from the Company, or the vendor, to the shipping carrier. That means that if any products are lost or damaged in transit, you will be responsible for making any claims with the carrier. Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor any of its vendors will be responsible for products lost or damaged in transit.
Delivery.
The Company is not to be accountable for delays in delivery occasioned by acts of God or other circumstances over which the Company has no direct control. Factory shipment or delivery dates are the best estimates of our suppliers, and in no case shall the Company be liable for any consequential or special damages arising from any delay in delivery.

No Solicitation.
In no event may any person or entity solicit any users with data retrieved from this Site.
Intellectual Property Rights.
Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring any license or right, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under copyright or other intellectual property rights. User agrees that the Information and Site are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary rights and laws. For additional information see Legal.
Registration.
In the event that certain sections of this Site require User to register, User agrees to provide Company with accurate, complete registration information. It is User's responsibility to inform Company of any changes to that information. Each registration is for a single person only, unless specifically designated otherwise on the registration page. Company does not permit (a) any other person using the registered sections under User's name; or (b) access through a single name being made available to multiple users on a network. User is responsible for preventing such unauthorized use. If User believes there has been unauthorized use, notify Company immediately by emailing Company.
Low Price Guarantee.
The Company strives to provide the lowest price for products offered on its Site. If you find a lower price on an identical product (including shipping) and would like us to match the lower price, you must fax to the Company at 614-416-6566 the following items with a request for the Low Price Guarantee: (1) a quote for the lower price on the letterhead of the company offering the lower price; and (2) a copy of the website page showing the price offered for the exact item, same quantity and same shipping method. Upon receipt of all of the required information set out above, the Company will contact you. The Low Price Guarantee applies only to new products from authorized U.S. vendors and does not apply to open box, factory seconds discontinued or floor/demo products. We do not price match auction sites. We also reserve the right to refuse to match a price in situations where competitors have made errors in their advertisements or are selling far below cost. In this situation, we will advise you immediately. If you need any more information regarding our Low Price Guarantee, please call customer service at 877-677-9988.
