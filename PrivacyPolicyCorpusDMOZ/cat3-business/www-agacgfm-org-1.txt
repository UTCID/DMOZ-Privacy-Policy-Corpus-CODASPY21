Privacy Policy
AGA Store
Purpose
This privacy policy covers the privacy practices of the Association of Government Accountants (AGA) with respect to personally identifiable information (PII) that is transmitted electronically to or collected by AGA through this website, as well as collection of information through cookies and web beacons . The policy addresses the following items:
How AGA collects and uses PII.
With whom AGA may share PII.
The choices available to you, as a website visitor, regarding the collection, use and sharing of PII.
The security procedures AGA has in place for PII under our control.
AGA website cookie policy.
By visiting this website and/or using the website’s services, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. As we update and expand our services, this privacy policy may change. Be sure to check back to this page from time to time.
This website, located at www.agacgfm.org, including any services and features available on or through the website, such as blogs and user communities, is published and maintained by the association. AGA is referred to in this privacy policy as “we,” “us,” “our,” or other similar pronouns.
What is Personally Identifiable Information?
PII is any information about an individual that is maintained by an organization. PII includes information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records. It also includes any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial and employment information.
PII Collection
AGA does not collect PII from you unless you expressly volunteer the information. This includes instances when you:
Register for a meeting, become a member, register for certification, purchase or download an AGA product or service.
Request information (electronically) about AGA’s products and services, subscribe to newsletters, or enter a promotional contest.
Use or participate in various services or features made available on the website, including, for example and without limitation, blogs and other user communities.
Use various tools to select AGA products and services suitable for your website visit.
Request contact with an AGA representative.
Provide AGA with comments, questions or feedback about AGA products and services or your website experience.
PII Usage
AGA does not sell, rent, give away or loan any PII about its members and customers to any third party, other than organizations directly connected to AGA, including business partners. Organizations with access to PII are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.
Among other things, we may use your PII to:
Respond to your requests and inquiries.
Provide you with services and features offered on or through the website.
Communicate timely information and special offers (such as in emails, mailings and the like) about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.
You may choose not to receive such information by managing your subscriptions at www.agacgfm.org/profile or by e-mailing agamembers@agacgfm.org. Please understand that if you choose not to receive promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.
Credit Cards
If you register for a meeting or pay for products and services using a credit card, PII (such as your name and shipping address) and financial information (such as your credit card number and expiration date) may be required. This information may be used for billing purposes and to fill orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information may be used to get in touch with you. We also may share attendee registration information with exhibitors and sponsors of AGA conferences and similar events, which these exhibitors and sponsors may use to promote their products and services.
CGFM
If you become a Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM), your name will be published on this website unless you expressly request its removal.
Marketing
The PII you give us through the website and information about your order may be combined with other PII (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information may be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient, and will help us to improve the operations and maintenance of our website and business.
Links
AGA’s website contains links to other sites. Some are links to the sites of AGA’s partners that offer AGA members and customers a variety of special products and services. Please be aware AGA is not responsible for the content, security or privacy practices on or of these other sites. We trust that you are aware of this when you leave the AGA website, and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of each site to which ours is linked.
This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by or on the website.
Security
This website takes reasonable precautions to protect PII submitted to AGA through its website. However, because the internet is an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. When possible, certain sensitive PII is encrypted and protected using SSL software.
You may be able to create an account on our website with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality and security of your account password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of the website through your password or account, whether such access or use has been authorized by you or on behalf of you, and whether such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify AGA of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. When you desire to cancel your account on this website, it is your responsibility to notify AGA. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.
In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your PII in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances. If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer we use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at agamembers@agacgfm.org with the alternative contact information.
If you have any questions about privacy on the AGA website, please email agamembers@agacgfm.org.
Correcting and Updating Personal Information
If your PII changes, such as a zip code, or if you no longer desire to use or access our website or services, log in to www.agacgfm.org/profile or send an email to agamembers@agacgfm.org or call AGA Customer Service at 800.AGA.7211 so we can correct, update or remove your PII, as requested. AGA members and customers can also access and update PII by logging into the password-protected area of the site.
