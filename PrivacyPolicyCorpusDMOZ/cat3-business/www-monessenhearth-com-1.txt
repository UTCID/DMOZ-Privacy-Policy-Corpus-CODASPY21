Our Designated Agent is:
If you are a copyright owner (or authorized

claimed infringement that includes substantially the following:
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to
act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
works at that site.
