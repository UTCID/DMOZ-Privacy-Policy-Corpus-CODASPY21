This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than that of the State of California. You hereby consent to, and agree to bring any and all claims in, the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A., for any action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Application, or the use of, or reliance on this Application, whether based in contract or tort or otherwise.
Entire Agreement
Duly Executed Master Professional Application Agreements, Statements of Work, Product & Application License Agreements and Hosted Software Agreements notwithstanding, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between you and AdvisoryWorld regarding the subject matter hereof and shall supersede any and all prior negotiations, representations, warranties, undertakings, or agreements, written or oral, between the parties regarding such subject matter.
Severability
To the maximum extent possible, each provision in this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and enforceable under applicable law. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be modified so as to be rendered valid and enforceable while implementing, to the maximum extent possible, the original intent of such provision. If such modification is not possible or allowed, then such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such unenforceability or invalidity without affecting the remainder of such provision or any other provisions in this Agreement.
Subscription and Application
Your subscription will continue to automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration and your credit card will be charged for each such renewal at the subscription fee in effect at the time of that renewal. In those instances where you took advantage of a special or introductory offer to become a licensed user, your subscription will automatically renew to the term specified in the offer and your credit card will be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time of that renewal. The term “subscription term” shall refer to the term of your subscription then in effect, regardless of whether it is the initial term or any renewal of that term.
ADVISORYWORLD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDING OR REMOVING FEATURES). IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY SUCH CHANGES, OR IF YOU ARE OTHERWISE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PREMIUM SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS PERFORMANCE OR AVAILABILITY), YOUR ONLY REMEDY WILL BE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, AS SET FORTH BELOW.
Your subscription is personal to you, and you may not transfer or share your subscription with any other person (including but not limited to your coworkers) other than immediate family members living in the same household, provided that: (i) such family members have read and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Premium membership Agreement; (ii) your subscription is not simultaneously used by more than one person at any given time; and (iii) you agree to be responsible for any use of your subscription by those other family members.
Charges and Billing Practices
AdvisoryWorld reserves the right to change the fees it charges for products, services or features (collectively, “Products”) offered in connection with the Licensed Application at any time. These sorts of changes include, but are not limited to, adding fees for new/optional Products and/or modifying fees for existing Products. By using any of the Products, with which there are associated fees, you agree to pay those fees. If you do not want to pay these associated fees, you must cancel your subscription, as set forth below.
Subscription fees and all others fees and charges associated with your subscription (including, but not limited to, any applicable federal, state, and local taxes) will be billed automatically to the credit card you provide when registering for the Application (“your credit card”). If your credit card is a VISA or MasterCard and the number or expiration date for your credit card changes for any reason (for instance, you get a new number because your old card expired, was stolen, etc.), that updated information may be automatically passed on from your credit card issuer to AdvisoryWorld, and if we do receive such information, it will be treated by AdvisoryWorld as if it were originally furnished by you. To learn more about this service being provided by your credit card issuer, please contact them directly.
You must promptly notify AdvisoryWorld (as set forth below) if any information related to your credit card changes is no longer valid or of any other change to the information you provided AdvisoryWorld regarding your credit card (including, but not limited to, changes to your billing address or other pertinent contact information). Absent such notification, AdvisoryWorld will assume that all of the information related to your credit card remains valid and will submit to the card processor all information that it requires for approval, both when you initially subscribe and, if applicable, upon the commencement of any renewal of that subscription. If any subscription fees or other charges billed to your credit card are declined for any reason, AdvisoryWorld shall have the right to suspend your subscription until such subscription fees or other charges are paid in full. You agree to pay all costs (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by AdvisoryWorld in collecting any unpaid subscription fees or other charges from you.
Cancellation
If you bought your subscription through AdvisoryWorld, you may cancel your subscription by calling 800-480-3888 or emailing accounting@advisoryworld.com to notify AdvisoryWorld.
Except as otherwise provided herein, if you cancel your subscription at any time your membership will continue in effect until the monthly anniversary of the effective date of your paid subscription and then terminate on that date. (For example, if your paid subscription start date is on January 1 and you cancel on June 15, your membership continues until July 1, at which time it ends). For Annual Members, any remaining charges will be refunded, prorated on a monthly basis, to your credit card after your membership is terminated.
AdvisoryWorld may immediately cancel your subscription, without notice or liability, if it determines in its sole discretion that: (i) you have breached any portion of this User Agreement; or (ii) your use of or access to the Licensed Application violates any applicable law or regulation or otherwise inhibits any other subscriber from using or accessing the Licensed Application or any other service offered by AdvisoryWorld. None of the foregoing limits any other legal, equitable, or contractual rights available to AdvisoryWorld.
AdvisoryWorld may, in its sole discretion, choose not to renew your subscription by sending a notice of non-renewal at any time during your subscription term to the e-mail address you provided when completing your registration. You will be deemed to have received this notice, whether or not you saw it or the e-mail address provided by you continues to be valid. In the event of such a notice, your subscription will cease and will not automatically renew at the end of your then-current subscription term.
