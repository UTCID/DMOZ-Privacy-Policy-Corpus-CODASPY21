Privacy
At SL Green we respect your right to privacy.
For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of SL Green, download free information, enter contests, or request information.
We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services that we provide on SL Green are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.
When you provide SL Green with your name (or alias), email address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you do not “opt out,” SL Green and SL Green representatives may use the provided information to alert you to special offers, updated information, new services, and other SL Green information. Beyond its representatives, SL Green does not offer or allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties.
SL Green respects the rights users give us when opting to receive email communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users. If you do not want SL Green or SL Green representatives to contact you, you may “opt out” of this preference at any time, whether you’re online or contacting SL Green directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you’ll always have the option to opt back in and have SL Green contact you based on your previous or new preferences.
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most areas of the SL Green website; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.
