Consent
By using our Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure
of your information in the manner disclosed below. Because of the
rapidly evolving legal and business environment surrounding privacy on
the Internet, please be aware that Butter Buds must reserve the right to
modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in which event we would post an
appropriate notice of such change by updating the “Last Updated”
legend.
Please bear in mind that this Privacy Policy only addresses our use
and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that
you disclose information or data to other parties or other websites on
the Internet, including websites that you may reach through our
Websites, different rules or policies may apply.
What Type of Information Do We Collect?
In order to measure the usefulness and efficiency of our Website, and
in an attempt to provide a more pleasant and personalized on-line
experience, we automatically track certain information from all visitors
to our Website. This information is compiled and analyzed on an
aggregated basis.
We may use “cookies” on certain pages of our Website. “Cookies” are
small data files that are stored on your hard drive and contain certain
information accessible to our Website, such as any information content
preferences you may voluntarily set at our Website and your username and
password, if you voluntarily register with us as a user of our Website
(should we at any time make such registration available). You are always
free to turn off cookies if your browser permits, although you may not
be able to use certain features on our Website and you may be required
to reenter your password more frequently during a session if passwords
are required to access any part of our Website.
Butter Buds may also collect information through interactive
questionnaires and registration requests. For example, in response to
such questionnaires and registration requests, you may be asked to
provide (i) your name, (ii) address, (iii) gender, (iv) number of people
in your household or company and their age ranges, and (v) your
preference as to receiving additional information regarding certain
products, services or health related topics. Furthermore, we may request
certain credit card information if you attempt to purchase any products
that may be available from our online stores. Although you are not
required to share such information, if you elect not to share certain
information, you may not be able to purchase certain products and/or
utilize certain services or functionality. If you voluntarily send us
any correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may also retain such
correspondence and information in a file specific to you.
If you have voluntarily provided us with such information, we may use
your email address, mailing address and phone number to contact you
regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and
communications relevant to your use of our Website or products and
services offered by Butter Buds and its affiliates. You have the option
of not participating in these programs by not providing us with your
contact information or by opting out after receipt of such information.
Who Does Butter Buds Share My Information With?
We will not sell, trade, rent or share your personally identifiable
information with any third party, other than as disclosed in this
Privacy Policy and/or unless you consent to such disclosure (e.g., your
request to receive certain goods or services from a third party or
otherwise utilize certain features of the Website, or via direct
agreement to such disclosure). Notwithstanding the above, in order to
offer you a high level of quality products and services, we may use
personally identifiable information or other information you have
provided in order to transmit communications to you, and we may share
certain personally identifiable information about you with our
subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and partners. Butter Buds takes all
reasonable precautions to ensure that its subsidiaries, affiliates,
agents and partners respect the privacy of your personally identifiable
information and use it only for its intended purposes. You may opt-out
of any disclosure of your personally identifiable information by sending
a blank e-mail message to opt-out@bbuds.com.
We may use some third party suppliers and providers to directly or
indirectly provide products and services to our customers, and we may
need to share your personally identifiable information with them in
order to permit them to provide the products and services. For example,
we use a reputable third party credit card processing agency for online
purchases made with credit cards. If you choose to use these optional
services or products, we will, by necessity, provide some of your
personally identifiable information to the third party provider offering
such services or products for purposes consistent with such offering.
Additionally, in some instances, the third party supplier or provider
may collect information directly from you. Because we do not control the
privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their
practices before deciding to use their services or products. In
addition, a co-brand provider may directly ask you for certain
information to assist it in providing you with products or services.
Butter Buds expressly reserves the right to retain, disclose or
report any of your information in limited circumstances where we
reasonably deem it necessary to comply with applicable laws, rules and
regulations, to cooperate with government or industry regulators and law
enforcement officials, to perform any necessary credit checks or
collect or report debts owed to us, or to protect our rights or
property. It is our policy to comply with any such requirements
(including a good-faith belief that such requirement exists), and you
agree we shall have no liability for any such disclosure or retention.
We also may collect and report to third parties aggregate,
non-personally identifiable information about you and other users of our
Website for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes.
What Kinds of Security Procedures Does Butter Buds Use?
We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of
your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption if your browser is capable of using such
encryption. However, please bear in mind that “perfect security” does
not exist on the Internet, although you can increase your protection by
proper use and maintenance of your passwords, electing to use SSL or
industry standard encryption when available and evaluating the privacy
policies of websites you use.
