Main sustainability policiesProduct stewardship policy
Product Stewardship is part of Pirelli’s sustainable and ethical business culture and includes all activities aimed at minimising the health, safety, environmental and social impacts of products throughout all the phases of their life-cycle.
Our responsibility on materials innovation, product design, sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, and performance during a product’s use, disposal and recycling is to pursue the right balance between economic prosperity, environmental protection, public health and social needs.
Pirelli provides its Stakeholders with a dedicated channel (the “Group Whistleblowing Policy-Complaint Procedure” published on the Pirelli website) for reporting any situation, including anonymously, that in breach of this Policy poses or could pose a risk regarding Pirelli Product Stewardship matters.
The commitments cited above are included in the Product Stewardship Policy.
