Welcome to the website of Plan Optik AG. Thank you for visiting our website and your interest in our company, our products and our services.
We respect your private sphere
As the operator of this website and controller, the company Plan Optik AG, Ueber der Bitz 3, 56479 Elsoff, takes the protection of your data very seriously. We therefore view the protection of your private sphere during the processing of personal data and the security of all business data as important considerations which we take into account in our business processes. We treat your personal data confidentially and only process such data in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy notice.
This privacy notice explains which data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for which purpose this takes place. Data protection and information security are part of our company policy.
This website may contain external links to which this privacy notice does not apply. We have no influence over whether the operators of the linked websites comply with data protection regulations.
What are personal data?
Personal data are data which allow for your personal identification.
1. Recording of data on our website
1.1. Collection and processing of personal data
Your data can be collected, for example, when you provide it to us.†This could, for example, be data you enter on a contact form.
When visiting our homepage, the following log data, known as server log files, are collected and saved automatically:
The browser type and browser version
Operating system used
Referrer URL
Host name of the computer used for access
Time of the server query
The IP address
This data is not combined with other data sources.
The data processing is based on Section 6, (1) lit f, GDPR, which allows the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.
We refer to the fact that security gaps may exist when transferring data on the internet (with communication by email, for example). Complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.
1.2. Use of personal data
We largely use your data to ensure the error-free provision of our website. Other data may be used to analyse your user behaviour, for customer administration, for product surveys or for marketing purposes. Your data will not be forwarded to third parties without consent.
1.3. SSL and/or TLS encryption
For security reasons and in the interests of protecting confidential content such as any orders or enquires you may send to us as the website operator, this website uses an SSL and/or TLS encryption. You can identify an encrypted connection as the address field in the browser changes from ìhttp://î to ìhttps://î and through a lock symbol in the browser field, for example.
If the SSL- and/or the TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be accessed by third parties.
2. Rights
2.1. Right to withdraw your consent to the data processing
Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can withdraw consent that you provided on a previous occasion at any time. To do so, sending us an informal message by email is sufficient. In this respect, the lawfulness of the data processing prior to the withdrawal of consent remains unaffected.
2.2. Right to data portability
You or a third party have the right to be provided with the data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent, or for the fulfilment of a contract, in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be take place insofar as it is technically feasible.
2.3. Access, blocking, erasure
Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right of access to your stored personal data, their origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing, and to the possible rectification, blocking or erasure of these data, if applicable, at any time. If you have any questions on this matter or the topic of personal data, you can contact our company Data Protection Officer, who is referred to below, at any time.
2.4. Right to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority
In case of infringements of the data protection law, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.

The appropriate contact details are available at the following link: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Adressen/LfD/Rheinland-Pfalz.html?nn=5217144
2.5. Objection to advertising emails

Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.
We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.
