We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products and services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your confidential information and financial records. We have established security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to your information. These standards are for both our traditional banking products and services and our electronic online services.Internet Applicable Privacy DisclosureWe do collect general information about your visit, such as when our site was accessed, which pages were accessed and what Internet provider was used. We can not identify a specific user from this record. You may elect to provide us with more specific information, such as when you give us feedback or send us an e-mail.When you visit our website, a 'cookie' is attached to the computer accessing the system. 'Cookies' are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of the visit to the site. Cookies allow website operators to better customize visits to the site to the individuals preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many websites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie.E-mail contact through our website does not require you to disclose any personally identifying information. Because there is a small risk that information transmitted via Internet e-mail could fall into the wrong hands, we suggest that confidential information, such as account numbers or Social Security numbers, not be transmitted via e-mail. But in order to process certain types of e-mail requests, you may be asked for specific information about yourself in order to process the request or facilitate a decision. In addition, if you choose to contact us via e-mail, please keep in mind that your e-mail address and any other information your e-mail header shows about you, such as your organization or name, will be revealed to us in the e-mail.

These are offered as a courtesy and a convenience. We assume no responsibility for the content, safety, security, or privacy of any such site or any transactions with respect thereto. If you have questions or concerns about any other site's policy regarding these matters, you should contact that site or its sponsor.Children's PrivacyProtecting the privacy of our children is more critical today than ever. For that reason, our website is not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Parental consent is required for children under 13 to provide personally identifiable information via our website.Additional online security measuresData is encrypted as it travels to and from your PC. Encryption is accomplished through a 128 bit "Secure Sockets Layer," the de facto standard for data encryption on the Internet. This means unauthorized individuals cannot decipher your sensitive financial information.User IDs and passwords are stored on our bank's computer, isolated from the Internet, where they can not be accessed or downloaded by anyone on the Internet.Our computer system does not connect directly to the Internet. It is isolated from the network via a "firewall" -- a software and hardware product that defines, controls and limits the access that "outside" computers have to the bank's computer. This firewall subscribes to the standards set by the NCSA (National Computer Security Association). In other words, use of the firewall allows only authenticated bank customers or administrators to send or receive transactions through it.We operate within all the rules and regulations of banking and bank security as set forth by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We are committed to working with our communications providers to produce the safest operating environment possible for our customers and will take advantage of evolving security enhancements. If you have any questions regarding Kitsap Bank's privacy statement or procedures, please contact us via e-mail or call us at 800-2TELLER (800-283-5537).
