Return Policy
What is your return & exchange policy?
You may return a product for refund, store credit, or exchange (if due to Boca Bearings error) within 30 days of the order shipment date. (The order shipment date and order notification are provided to you by email). All returns must be accompanied with a Return Authorization number (RA#).To get an RA# please contact us direct at 1-800-332-3256 (1-561-998-0004.)
If we shipped you the wrong product, or it arrived defective or damaged, no problem. Just contact us within 30 days of the item's original shipping date to arrange for the return of your purchase. We will issue you an RA#. When we recieve the goods back we will send a replacement or refund you for your purchase, provided the returned item(s) are received back in their original packaging.
If you ordered the wrong item, wrong size, or simply changed your mind, we will refund you for your purchase (minus the shipping cost), provided the returned item(s) are received back in their original packaging, provided your purchase is in "as-new" condition, and the purchased product was not noted as a clearance, close-out or non-returnable item. When your return is received, you will be issued a refund to your credit card or a store credit for the merchandise only. (Please note that you will be responsible for return shipping costs of non-defective merchandise) Some products may also be assessed a restocking fee - please ask if you are unsure. Additional restrictions may apply, please contact us for more information.
