Personal data
The personal information which you provide to UKi Media & Events in relation to attendance at any of our virtual Online Conferences and/or Events will be held by us in accordance with our Privacy Policy on a database and, where we have authorisation and considered consent from you, that personal information may be shared with other entities within UKi Media & Events.
By registering for a ticket to attend one of our events, or accepting a ticket, you are consenting to your details being included in our mailing list which will be used to send you details about future events, virtual and physical.
By registering, or accepting an invitation to attend the virtual event, your name, job title, and the company to which you are engaged will be visible to all other attendees and to our speakers, sponsors, and any press who pick up on the event so that such registration or acceptance will be an acknowledgement to us that you consent to such use of your personal data.
When booking your attendance, you may be asked if you wish to be contacted by sponsored parties. If you agree to such contact, sponsored parties may contact you by post or email with information or offers regarding their own goods and services.
At virtual conferences and events, sponsors and exhibitors may use lead generation and contact forms.
By attending a speaking session at the virtual conference or event you are agreeing that your delegate ID can be scanned by us as a member of the audience at the speaking session of that conference/event. This will also confirm to us your considered consent that we may pass on such information as you provide to us to third parties.
By registering to attend a virtual conference session on our agenda of events in the event platform, you will be asked for your email address and for your consent for us to share your details in accordance with these terms and conditions regarding your attendance and your Privacy (including the provisions set out in our Privacy Policy) and that you agree that our sponsored parties who are affiliated with that virtual conference session may contact you.
You can at any time request us to no longer share your details with others by emailing datachanges@ukimediaevents.com.
However, after such deletion by us of your personal details, you will no longer be able to attend one of our virtual conference sessions.
