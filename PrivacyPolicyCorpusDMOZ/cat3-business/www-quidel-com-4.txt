11. Safe Harbor Disclaimer.  This website contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve material risks, assumptions and uncertainties. Many possible events or factors could affect our future financial results and performance, such that our actual results and performance may differ materially from those that may be described or implied in the forward-looking statements. As such, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “might,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “goal,” “project,” “strategy,” “future,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. The risks described in reports and registration statements that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) from time to time (and which are available at ir.quidel.com under “SEC Filings”), should be carefully considered. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision or update of these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
12. Indemnity.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Quidel and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the website;, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, right provided by any labor or employment law, rule, or regulation, or intellectual property right; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any information, materials, content or account information that is submitted via your account including without limitation misleading, false, or inaccurate information; (vi) your gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (vii) any other party’s access and use of the website (or access and use of any third-party service via the website) with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code (or, with respect to third-party services, your account information).
13. Arbitration.  READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY.
For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at legal@quidel.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the use or access to the website, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.  JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.  The arbitration will be conducted in San Diego County, California, unless you and Quidel agree otherwise.  If you are using the website for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.  If you are an individual using the website for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.
14. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.  WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE WEBSITE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AND QUIDEL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
15. General Assignment.  Any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.
16. Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms and Conditions.  We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the website, as determined by us in our sole discretion.  We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms and Conditions.  Quidel is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.  We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update these Terms and Conditions from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically.  When we change the Terms and Conditions in a material manner, we will update the version number and date at the top of this page.  Your continued use of the website after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions.  If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms and Conditions, do not use or access (or continue to access) the website.
17. Entire Agreement/Severability.  These Terms and Conditions, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Quidel in connection with the website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the website.  If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable
18. No Waiver.  No waiver of any term of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
