Redmond Respect
Redmond is very serious about protecting the privacy of all personal data you provide us via this website or any other means.
Please note, by using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of the Redmond Privacy Policy, which details our policies regarding the collection, use and transfer of your personal data, the security measures we employ to protect it, and your right to control, access, and maintain it. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use this site.
The “skinny” version of our Privacy Promise is this: respecting the privacy of your personal data means that a) we collect it for the sole purpose of advancing your Search, b) we do not sell it to advertisers, marketers, or anyone who is out to get “a list” of folks like you, and c) we take specific, best-practice security precautions to reduce the risk of it falling into the wrong person’s hands.
If you have any questions about Redmond’s Privacy Policy, or wish to report a violation of our Privacy Policy, please email us at respect@redmondresearch.com.
