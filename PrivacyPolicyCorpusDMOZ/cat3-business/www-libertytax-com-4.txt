Do Not Call (DNC) Policy
At Liberty, we recognize the importance of protecting your personal information. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of your information and want you to know the protective measures we take.
Liberty will adhere to all applicable and enforceable federal and state laws and regulations governing outbound telephone calls for the protection of the privacy of telephone consumers. The National Do Not Call Registry is managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation’s consumer protection agency. Liberty will not call any number appearing on the federal or state do not call list (unless permitted by applicable law) or the number of a person, who request not to receive telemarketing campaign calls made on the behalf of Liberty Tax Service®.
If you request not to receive calls from us, you will be placed on our internally maintained DNC list and will not be called for any future telemarketing campaigns. Upon your request, Liberty will document immediately. Please allow up to 30 days for your telephone number to be removed from any campaigns that are currently underway. You will remain on Liberty’s “Do Not Call “list for 5 years, unless you ask to be removed. Also, some states have Do Not Call laws that require Liberty to honor such request for a longer period of time, and it is Liberty’s policy to comply with those laws when applicable. When submitting a request via phone to be placed on the DNC list, all calls may be monitored or recorded. Liberty reserves the right to revise this “Do Not Call Policy”.
All employees that engage in outbound telephone solicitation are trained in this policy and are made aware of these procedures before they are allowed to place campaigns calls to consumers. Management reviews the policy with employees on a seasonal basis. If a consumer requests a copy of our “Do Not Call” Policy, Liberty will send a copy via U.S. mail or electronic mail. The “Do Not Call” policy is also posted on the Liberty intranet site under Owned and Operated Customer Care Center – DNC Policy.

We follow generally accepted standards, such as encryption and secure socket layer technology, to protect the personal information you submit to us, whether that information is in transit or at rest.
