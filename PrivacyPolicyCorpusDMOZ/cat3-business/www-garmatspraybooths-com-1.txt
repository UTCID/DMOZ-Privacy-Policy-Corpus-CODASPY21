Submitting a completed CA Privacy Act Request Form, found below
Mail at the address provided at the end of this Notice (see “Contact Us”)
Only you, or a person legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a valid request related to your personal information. You may also make a valid request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only request access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Your request must (1) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we gathered personal information or an authorized representative. And (2) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it appropriately. We cannot reply to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the requested personal information relates to you. Making a valid request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requester’s identity or authority to make the request.
Timing & Format of Responses: We will do our best to respond to a valid consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12 months preceding our receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a payment, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under California law. Unless permitted by applicable law, we will not deny you goods or services, charge you different rates, provide you with a different level or quality, or suggest that you may receive a different rate for goods or services.
However, we may offer you specific financial incentives permitted under California law that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any legally-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
