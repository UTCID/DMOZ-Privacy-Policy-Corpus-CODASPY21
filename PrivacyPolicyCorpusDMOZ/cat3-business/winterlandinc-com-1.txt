Winterland does not share, rent, or sell any personally identifying information provided through our Site (such as your name or email address) to any outside organization for use in its marketing or solicitations. From time to time Winterland may use agents or contractors who will have access to your personal information to perform services for Winterland (such as database maintenance or computer upgrades), however, they are required by us to keep the information confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services for Winterland. In addition, Winterland may also share aggregate information about its customers and its web site visitors to advertisers, business partners, and other third parties. For example, we might share that our users are x percent PCs users and y percent Macintosh users. None of this information, however, will contain personal, identifying information about our users.
Winterland On-line Store
The Winterland On-line Store is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your identifying information. If you choose, you can set up an account. This will allow you to have a customized order page for express ordering and to view your purchasing history. To protect your privacy, we have designed the Sites to include certain steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections in an account. You will always have access to this account information and can view it, update it or correct it at any time. To access your information, you will need to use a password.
When purchasing products through the our web site, the order form will also ask you to provide a daytime telephone number. However, the telephone number is only used to quickly resolve questions relative to an order, such as to clarify customer email addresses that are inactive, or entered incorrectly.

Once you leave Winterland Inc.com, Winterland cannot control, and has no responsibility for, the privacy policies or data collection activities at another site.
