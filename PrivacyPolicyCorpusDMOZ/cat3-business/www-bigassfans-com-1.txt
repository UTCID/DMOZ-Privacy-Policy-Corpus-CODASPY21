Information we collect and how we use it
Curious about what we do with your data? Well, you’ve come to the right place! When you use any of our websites, our SenseMe application or our kickass SenseMe products, we may collect information to improve our products and services (progress is kind of our thing), how we market, or to process the data related to energy efficiency and thermal comfort.
The data collected is gathered using some pretty cool technology, including tools like Google Analytics and reporting from our apps/devices in communication with our cloud servers, aptly dubbed the Big Ass Cloud. Information about your web browser, operating system, pages visited, and more are also gathered through Google Analytics and similar tools.
If it strikes your fancy, you may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) on this web site or to Big Ass Fans via other methods as described below. We also tell you how we may use the information (it’s not to stalk you if that’s what you’re worried about). If you use our Haiku Home SenseMe products, we’ll collect and store data from your connected fans and/or devices in accordance with this data privacy policy.
Here are some of the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. Kudos to you for giving a damn!
Product Registration
When you purchase a product from Big Ass Fans or register through the SenseMe application, we may request a variety of information to allow us to provide better service.
And better service means a happier YOU. This information can include your name, address, phone number, email address, product’s model number, serial number and purchase date.
Data from SenseMe Products
The data collected is gathered from our apps/devices in communication with our cloud servers, the Big Ass Cloud.
This data is used to improve future products and develop more super awesome features or services for our customers.
Our apps and devices collect information such as:
Room Temperature
The state of the device (examples: on/off, speed)
The device’s IP address
Occupancy in order to help control energy usage and thermal comfort
The device uptime, firmware version, and technical information about the app and device
Account information including the data you share during the sign-up process
Sales, Service and Promotional Activity
If you schedule a service call or delivery, make a consumer inquiry, purchase parts, participate in our promotional activities (such as rebates or contests) or email us through the “Contact Us” link on this site, we ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well. So click, comment and ask away! Unsurprisingly, we love talking about our products.
Questionnaires and Surveys
We occasionally may ask visitors to our web site and consumers to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. You’re a donkey person? Hell yes! These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our site. In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email address. But no worries; we do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a Big Ass Fans survey unless you specifically agree to provide that information.
Information from Third-Party Sources
We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources (as permitted by law), which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. We also may receive information about you from third-party social networking services when you choose to connect with those services. Yay for interconnectedness!
Our site uses a third party service to match browser cookies to your mailing address. We then use another company to send special offers through the mail on our behalf. Our company never receives or stores any of this information and our third parties do not provide or sell this information to any other company or service.
To opt-out of receiving our direct mail, you may send us an email at info@bigassfans.com, call us at 1-877-244-3267, or send a written request to 2348 Innovation Drive, Lexington, KY 40511.

Information We Share
We share data inside Big Ass Fans with tools and people who are focused on improving the benefits of our products and services and to learn how to better market and sell. Like how we do things around here? Data from previous customers has helped mold us in to who we are today! The tools used to analyze the data are often developed or hosted by third parties through secure browsing sessions and/or encrypted data.
Your data is super duper safe with us. We limit data shared with any third party even if you connect to them through our apps. For example, if you sign up to connect your Haiku SenseMe fan with a smart thermostat like ecobee, then you can rest assured we do not share any data with the thermostat company. We do access your thermostat’s data to provide better thermal comfort and increased energy efficiency. This information is transmitted through secure connections. If you connect Amazon’s Echo with our awesome Haiku SenseMe fans or lights, we share the name you gave the fan with Echo so Alexa knows what you want when you say “Alexa – turn on the fan in Bobby’s Room.”
If you choose to have your products installed by Big Ass Fans or one of our trusted installers, we’ll keep things on lockdown by not sharing information about the products you purchased and any specific installation requirements.
In the event Big Ass Fans receives a valid legal request, we may be required to share your information with authorities who have jurisdiction to make such requests.
We will never sell your personal data to any third parties.
We can share information with our channel partners who we are in privity of contract with, who have contractual confidentiality obligations to us and who have agreed to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described here unless otherwise required by applicable laws.
If you choose to provide information to us and are located outside the United States of America, please be advised that Big Ass Fans dba Haiku Home will transfer your personal information to the United States of America and process it there.
