Commitment to Privacy
At Feil & Co*., respecting privacy is an important part of our commitment to our clients and employees.
Our commitment to privacy is reflected in The Feil & Co*. Privacy Code, which has been developed to comply with the relevant portions of the Personal Information Protection Act (British Columbia), and the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act (Canada).  In this respect, The Feil & Co*. Privacy Code governs our behavior with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of our clients’ and employees’ personal information.
We have also developed The Feil & Co*. Privacy Protection Pledge to explain why we collect personal information, how we use personal information and how we keep such information protected.  A copy of The Feil & Co*. Privacy Protection Pledge is available to all of our clients.  You can also review it at www.feilnco.com
