It Isn't a hard decision, we make the best concrete garages in the UK, our costs are rock solid, and if your garage is not still standing within 10 years, we'll rebuild it for you.That's the Lidget Compton GuaranteeTop TipSurveys show that most people would have a larger building than they originally specified once it is installed – a wider and/or longer building costs less if chosen when you first select – although you can extend buildings later, it is much more expensive.
