By Christopher Heine
May 1, 2015
Since it's been part of the program's storyline from practically the beginning, McCann has been tweeting about Mad Men episodes for years. But for the final season, it has been cast as an extreme antagonist as it swallows up the fictional subsidiary Sterling Cooper & Partners, the lifeblood of the show's narrative. Spoiler alert, folks: Save this story for later if you're not caught up on this season. 	During the last four Sundays of the AMC drama—there are just three left—the real McCann has had some fun with being the "bad guy." For instance, when the curvy redhead Joan Holloway visited McCann to discuss a pantyhose marketing plan in one episode, the shop's fictitious all-male team across the table acted incredibly sexist. Here was the real-life agency's tweet in response.
This meeting is so awkward. Our apologies on a purely theoretical basis. #MadMen
— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 6, 2015
During last week's episode, when Don Draper and his team's last-ditch effort to save the agency was all for naught, McCann tweeted this.
That didn't go well. #MadMen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 27, 2015
And after it became painfully clear that Sterling Cooper was losing its name and offices, McCann followed up with this pithy note and a near-perfect accompanying image.
Hey guys. It's not so bad here! #MadMen pic.twitter.com/QpoA5KyC3y 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 27, 2015
We wondered how all of this could impact McCann's business, so we asked Amobee Brand Intelligence to scour the Web for mentions-based data. Compared to the weeks leading into Mad Men's April 5 season premiere, online mentions/impressions for McCann are up 46 percent. Thirteen percent of all digital mentions for the agency are Mad Men-related, said Amobee. And, the Foster City, Calif.-based data company found that McCann's 40-odd tweets about the show in the last month have been retweeted nearly 1,000 times.  	It's probably reasonable to assume the show itself—which is popular with general consumers as well as the ad industry—is helping drive McCann's recent social media successes. But give the agency credit for having a good time with it—and the tweets are definitely helping the cause.
When we asked McCann reps to comment on how their efforts are going this season, the PR team coyly responded on Twitter instead of replying to the emailed inquiry.
@Chris_Heine @Adweek We're not evil. We're just dramaticized that way. 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 30, 2015
@Chris_Heine @Adweek And, We're going to be the first agency to get a SAG card. #MadMen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 30, 2015
Lastly, here's a handful of our favorite tweets from the 113-year-old agency.
We do not believe you love veal, Peggy. But we love you. #MadMen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 6, 2015
What is Roger hiding under the 'stache? Something subconscious or metaphysical? #MadMen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 6, 2015
Thank God we didn't play the "McCann" drinking game with our boss or we'd be dead already. #MadMen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 6, 2015
"Black Irish Thugs" + "The Mick in McCann". We should call HR. #MadMen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 6, 2015
We're still a Coca-Cola agency. And yes, we've killed people. #madmen 	— McCann (@McCann_WW) April 20, 2015
