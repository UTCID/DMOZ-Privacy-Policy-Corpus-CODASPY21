or b) in a limited number of circumstances detailed below where we are satisfied an adequate level of protection exists for the rights of the individuals whose personal data is being transferred, given the nature of the personal information and the risk posed to the rights of the individual.  The scenarios where such data transfer may occur without explicit consent being sought, and the protections that are in place, are detailed below.When CVA employees travel outside of the EEA for work purposes, and access files stored either locally on their laptop hard drive or on our cloud file server, or emails on our email server. In all cases, the data is protected by strong encryption both in transit and at rest, and we are able to remote wipe data stored on the local hard drive in the event a laptop is lost or stolen. In no case will any personal information be downloaded to a system other than the employee’s device(s).When CVA employees collaborate on projects with colleagues from offices outside the EEA, they may transfer basic personal information about themselves and other employees such as contact information. This information is not intended to be disseminated outside the firm, is subject to the security measures in place in the office in question, and the potential for harm to the individuals concerned from inadvertent exposure of the information is extremely small.To make it easy for potential clients to contact us, personal information of some employees appears on various corporate websites which may be accessed from outside the EEA. The information is limited to employee photographs, email addresses and phone numbers. As such, the potential for harm to the individual is small, and it is easy for any employee to request their information be removed, without prejudice. D:  Your rights as a data subjectGDPR creates a number of data rights that you can exercise in relation to any personal data relating to you that we process.  An overview of the main elements of these rights is as follows:You have the right to ask whether we process your personal data, and if so, you may request (free of charge in most circumstances) a copy of all personal data we hold on you, as well as details of how we use it.You have the right to ask that any incorrect information we hold about you is corrected without undue delay.You have the right to have all personal data we hold on you erased without undue delay, unless there is an overriding ground not to do so, for instance if erasing data would undermine the firm’s ability to mount a legal defence in case of future litigation, or prevent us from performing a legal obligation.You have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal data until you say otherwise, without deleting it.You have the right to receive any personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, which you are then free to do with as you please.You have the right to object to any processing of personal data for purposes where the only legal grounds are the pursuit of CVA’s legitimate interest – in which case we must immediately cease processing of the data for the purposes you object to.You have the right not to be subject to any decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you, or similarly significantly affects you, unless we obtain your prior consent to such automated processing in advance.
