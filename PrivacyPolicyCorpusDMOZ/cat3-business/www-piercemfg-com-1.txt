Use of Cookies
Pierce Manufacturing collects certain information by automated means when you visit our websites. By collecting this information, Pierce Manufacturing learns how to best tailor our websites to our visitors. Pierce Manufacturing collects this information through various means such as “cookies,” “web beacons”, and “IP addresses” as explained below.
Like many companies, Pierce Manufacturing uses “cookies” and “web beacons” (also known as internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our websites. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. Web beacons allow us to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third-party. Pierce Manufacturing uses the information collected from these technologies to compile reports and help us improve the website.
For example, a cookie might tell us whether you have visited us before, the number of visitors to the website, which site a visitor has come from, the pages they visited, and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.
Pierce Manufacturing also collects IP addresses. An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our websites, Pierce Manufacturing may view and/or store the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. Pierce Manufacturing uses this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come from. Pierce Manufacturing also may use this information to enhance Pierce Manufacturing's websites.
