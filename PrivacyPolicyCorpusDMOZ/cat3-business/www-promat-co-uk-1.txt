Use of cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or other device by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.
General information about the cookies used
This Website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our websites.
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our websites and also allows us to improve our websites.
For detailed information on the cookies and other similar technologies that we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie Policy. When you visit our Website for the first time, the entry page will show information on privacy and respective wording regarding the consent to the use of cookies through a “cookie banner”. If you continue to actively use the Website and do not actively object to the use of cookies, you agree to our use of cookies and such consent will be stored in your browser, so that the information does not have to be repeated on every page of the Website. Should the consent be missing in your browser (e.g. if you deleted your cookies), the “cookie banner” with privacy information will appear again the next time you visit the Website. We may install and use certain technically required cookies which therefore do not require your prior consent. We may also use session cookies which are automatically deleted at the end of your session and which also do not require your prior consent. Other cookies (such as cookies to improve the navigational experience by keeping record of certain data – this avoids you having to reintroduce such data at each connection – and by tailoring the content of the Website to your preferences) may be installed and used on the basis of your consent. You will find all relevant information about the cookies used by this Website in the table below.

Share on social networks
We make use of a social plug-in to enable you to share Website’s information on Facebook or LinkedIn through “Share” buttons.
For data privacy reasons, we deliberately opted against utilizing direct social network plug-ins on our Website. Instead, we employ an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit the Website, data are never automatically transmitted to a social network. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the social network, i.e. clicking on elements then clicking on the social network’s icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the social network and sending usage data to that social network operator, whether or not you are a subscriber of such social network.
We have no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather. For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networks’ respective data privacy advisories.
