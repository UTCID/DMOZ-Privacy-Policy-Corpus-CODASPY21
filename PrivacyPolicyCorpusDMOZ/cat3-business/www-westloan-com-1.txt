ECOA
The ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the bases of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (providing the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicants income derives from any public assistance program; or, because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, enacted by Congress in 1975 and made permanent in 1988, requires depository and non-depository lenders to collect and publicly disclose information about housing-related loans and applications for such loans, including several applicant/borrower characteristics. This includes geographic distribution of loans and applications; ethnicity, race, sex, and income of applicants and borrowers; and information about loan approvals and denials.
HMDA is implemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation C (12 CFR Part 203) and a staff commentary (12 CFR Part 203, Supp. I).

Important Information about Procedures for Opening a New Account
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account (e.g., establishes a formal relationship by means of a loan application).
What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
