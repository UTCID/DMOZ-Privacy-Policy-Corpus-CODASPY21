You may naturally change them at any time. However, the number of attempts to access the Site and/or certain section thereof may be limited in order to prevent any fraudulent use of such codes.

You are solely responsible for any and all use of your Account Information and all Orders and activities that occur under or in connection with the Account. Without limiting any rights which We may otherwise have, We reserve the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable, to ensure the security of the Site and your Account, including without limitation, terminating your Account, changing your password, or requesting additional information to authorize transactions on your Account. You agree to be responsible for any act or omission of any users that access the Site or Services under your Account Information that, if undertaken by you, would be deemed a violation of these Terms of Use. In no event will We be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction by Us under this provision, (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your Account or password, and (iii) any unauthorized access to your Account or use of your password. You may not use anyone else's Account at any time, without the permission of the Account holder.
