Code of Business Conduct
The “Conflict Minerals Rule” (“Rule”) is a part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and implementing regulations, as issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  The Rule concerns publicly reporting companies, registered with the SEC, that are engaged in the manufacture of products which could contain tin, tantalum, gold or tungsten that may have been sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries (“Conflict Minerals”).  Under the Rule, such publicly reporting companies must provide certain disclosure to the SEC on Form SD if such Conflict Minerals are necessary to the function or production of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the reporting company.
OMAX is not publicly held, nor registered with the SEC, and is therefore not subject to the Dodd-Frank Act, nor the implementing regulations, including the Conflict Mineral Rule.  However, OMAX does have both clients and suppliers which may be subject to the Conflicts Mineral Rule.  Further, the Company supports the goal of ending violent conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries.  OMAX expects that its suppliers will support this same goal and commitment to the EICC Code of Conduct and due diligence guidance and will reasonably determine the source of possible Conflict Minerals in their manufactured products or materials that may have originated in the DRC or covered countries.  Further, OMAX expects that its suppliers will adopt a similar policy and, like OMAX, will require their suppliers to implement management systems to support compliance.  In furtherance of this policy, OMAX Corporation has implemented the following statement for inclusion as conditions of purchase on the Company's purchase orders:
"Sellers which are registered with the SEC as a publicly reporting company need to provide OMAX with a statement of Seller's adherence to the SEC's Conflict Minerals Rule.  OMAX further expects other non-registered suppliers to OMAX to join in the goal of eliminating products which they manufacture and which contain Conflict Minerals which are not DRC Conflict Free, from their respective supply chain.  We request that such non-registered suppliers implement their own polices for elimination of Conflict Minerals which are not DRC Conflict Free, and to provide statements to OMAX as evidence of those efforts.  Absence of the receipt of such statements by OMAX from non-registrant supplier may be a factor in OMAX's continued sourcing from such supplier."
