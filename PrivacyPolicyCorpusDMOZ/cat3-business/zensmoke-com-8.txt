Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy
Every year BBK Tobacco & Foods, LLP d/b/a HBI International (“HBI”) receives many submissions proposing ideas for the HBI’s use and commercialization. We appreciate this interest in HBI and want to thank each person who has taken the time and effort to get in touch with us.
Our policy, however, is that HBI and its officers, employees or agents do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas, suggestions, proposals, comments or materials, including for new or improved products, services or technologies, product or service enhancements, processes, advertising campaigns, promotions, marketing plans or new product or service names (collectively, “Submissions”). Please do not send any Submissions in any form to HBI or any of its officer, employees or agents.
The sole purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when HBI’s products, services, marketing or other projects might seem similar to any Submissions made to HBI.
TERMS GOVERNING SUBMISSIONS
If, despite our policy, you still submit your ideas to HBI, the following terms shall apply to your Submissions, regardless of what your communication states. You agree that:
• HBI will consider the Submissions to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.
• HBI may use, copy, redistribute and disclose the Submissions for any purpose in any manner, without compensation to you or any other person or party.
• HBI shall have no obligations concerning the Submissions, including no obligation to review the Submissions, return any materials, or acknowledge receipt of the Submissions.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT SEND US ANY SUBMISSIONS.
FEEDBACK
While we cannot accept unsolicited ideas, HBI always welcomes feedback on our existing business. If you want to send us your feedback, please only provide specific feedback on our existing business and do not include ideas that our policy prohibits. To provide feedback please visit the “Contact Us” section of our website at Contact. Any feedback you provide is deemed non-confidential and non-proprietary. HBI shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis, without any compensation to you or any other person or party.
