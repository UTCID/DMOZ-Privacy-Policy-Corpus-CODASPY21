Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our website.FS reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but, with the below exceptions, does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into the website a site that relies on third-party cookies).b.1. GoogleAd CookiesGoogle™, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on the website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to FS users based on their visits to the FS site and other sites on the Internet.
