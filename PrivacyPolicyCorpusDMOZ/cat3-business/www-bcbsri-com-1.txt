Need help managing your health?
Has managing your health taken over your life? We're here to help. As a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island member, you can take advantage of our Care Coordination Program at no additional cost. A dedicated Care Coordinator will work with you and your doctors to create a care plan and help you on the path to a healthier life.
These examples show some of the ways we can work together as a team.
You get your test results but don't really understand what they mean.
