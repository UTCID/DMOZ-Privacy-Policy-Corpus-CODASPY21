When I recieved the pin my eyes dropped to the floor.
Hello mr.John how are you sir,  I  wrote you before and didn't know for sure if you recieved my email. But  I  just want to say thank you again for a job well done. I just cant thank you enough for the superb work on the pin that you have done. I know  I  must have been a pest, but you did assure me that the finished product would meet my satisfaction. When  I  recieved the pin my eyes dropped to the floor. Also when  I  had shown the pin to the other staff of the security department at church, they were overwhelmed at the craftsmanship and could not wait to show it off for that sunday. Thank you so much again for our pins which  I  know you'll be hearing from me again , due to the other departments at church wanting to create their own pins also. God...

Really nice, clean, crisp coloring
Hi John. Just wanted to give you some feedback on the pins... First, they look terrific. Really nice, clean, crisp coloring, and it looks great on the brass/gold colored background metal. I already sold ten toward our charity, and hopefully we'll get the rest in circulation as the season progresses. A few people liked them so much that they are considering doing pins for their chapters and our fan club may consider having pin sets made for the club... I'll keep you posted. Thanks again! Dave

Will definitely use your company again!
Hi John, The pins look great. Apparently, they were supposed to be black, but I told you blue because the sample appeared blue to me. It's not a big deal. Anyway, they look fantastic and we will definitely use your company again! Thanks, Becky

The pins look great.
John, The pins look great. The logo designer and self proclaimed pin/patch expert (my wife) is very pleased, too. In all fairness, she has a strong background in art and has designed logos for a number of emergency service groups that have been turned into pins and patches. Thanks for the great service. I plan to work on a different pin and will probably contact you in a few months. Have a great summer. Steve
