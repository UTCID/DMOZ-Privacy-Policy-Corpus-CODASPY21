Buy American Act
The Buy American Act is a complex government regulation which could require legal assistance to understand fully. The simplest answer is that, in order to participate in a government or public works project, the materials and finished goods you source must be manufactured in the U.S. or, if the dollar value of the contract is high enough, one of 70+ foreign countries with which the U.S. has a trade agreement.
