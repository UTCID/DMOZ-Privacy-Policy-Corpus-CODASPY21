We will also consider you to be using our Websites and Apps if you utilize, benefit, take advantage of or interact with any feature, function, service, activity, promotion or content in, on or available through any of our Websites and Apps for any purpose, or if you try to do any of these things.

Privacy
We respect your privacy. You consent to our collection, use, disclosure and other handling of your information as described in our Privacy Policy, which we may update from time to time.
Ownership and Use of
Benjamin Moore Websites, Mobile Applications and Content
We maintain our Websites and Apps for your information, education, entertainment, and sales. Our Websites and Apps and, except as described below, all Content, is either the property of Benjamin Moore or our affiliates, licensors, suppliers, operational service providers, advertisers, agencies or promotional partners (collectively, "Benjamin Moore Entities"), and are legally protected, without limitation, under U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and treaties. To avoid any doubt, when the word "Content" is used it includes, but is not limited to, such things as software, code, design, text, images, photographs, illustrations, animations, audio, video and audio-visual material, art, graphic material, proprietary information, data, databases, service marks, trademarks, trade names, distinctive identification such as logos, the selection, sequence, 'look and feel' and arrangement of items and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable elements of any and all of our Websites and Apps.
Except as set forth in the “Unsolicited Suggestions: They Become Ours and We Have No Obligation to You” section below, you keep ownership to any and all Content that is yours; and if you submit or provide Content, these Terms and Conditions do not deprive you or any holder of your or their rights. However, when you do submit or provide Content to us or any of our Websites and Apps, you are giving us and the Benjamin Moore Entities an unconditional, irrevocable, transferable, royalty free worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, perform, adapt, translate, modify, create derivative works, publish, distribute, disseminate and/or broadcast that Content ("license") and you are representing and warranting to us that you have the right to give us and the Benjamin Moore Entities such license. If you do not have the right to license Content as set forth in these Terms and Conditions (or if you are not sure), do not submit or provide Content.
You may only use our Content and Content of other users for your own personal use and you have no right to transfer, assign or use the Content for any other purpose or allow or enable anyone else to do so. Personal use means nothing commercial or even charitable, whether or not money or other compensation or consideration is involved and whether or not it is for your benefit or for someone else. This also means you are not allowed to use, display, reproduce, perform, adapt, translate, modify, create derivative works, publish, distribute, disseminate and/or broadcast Content that is not yours without our express prior written consent. You may not alter, delete or conceal copyright or other notices, even if we let you download, display, print or share the Content with others. Unauthorized or prohibited use of Content may subject you to civil liability, criminal prosecution, or both under federal, state and local laws. Except as expressly provided above, nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring any license or right under any copyright or other intellectual property right.
Unsolicited
Suggestions: They Become Ours and We Have No Obligation to You
Benjamin Moore likes to hear from consumers and professionals about what they think about our products, and we encourage you to contact us. However, we do not accept, evaluate or consider unsolicited ideas, materials, concepts, information, content or suggestions of any kind ("Unsolicited Suggestions") including, but not limited to, those relating to products, processes, product names, advertising or marketing nor do we have or accept any obligation, liability or responsibility if you send us any Unsolicited Suggestions of any kind. We have found that this policy and approach avoids potential misunderstanding and dispute, since your Unsolicited Suggestion may seem similar to products, services or activities we undertake or commission, even those previously considered or currently under consideration, whether or not we implement them.
As a result, we have adopted a policy whereby we do not agree to accept, on any terms or under any conditions, Unsolicited Suggestions. Please do not submit, post or send us any Unsolicited Suggestions because if you do or you attempt to do so (whether you ignore these warnings, or do not read or attempt to understand them), you are agreeing that we can treat the Unsolicited Suggestion as our own, without any obligation of confidentiality, without any restrictions or conditions, and without obligation or liability to you or anyone else. We will be free to use or choose not to use all or any part of any Unsolicited Suggestions you submit for any purpose, any time and anywhere in the world, and we will also have the right to modify, re-purpose, do anything, or refrain from doing anything with respect to such Unsolicited Suggestions, free and clear of any requirements or restrictions of any kind. You should also understand that we will have no obligation to compensate, reward, account to you, notify you or even acknowledge any matters that relate to an Unsolicited Suggestion you submit.
You should consult with your own independent legal advisors concerning your rights or if you are not clear whether anything you wish to submit to us might be covered by the Unsolicited Suggestion policy and terms above.
If, after consultation with your attorney, you believe you have rights to legally protected and proprietary intellectual property which is not covered by the Unsolicited Suggestion policy and terms above, you (or your attorney) can contact us at:

Please notify us immediately if you suspect someone is using your registration, user identification, log-in, password or email address.

You agree to immediately notify us if you become aware or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other need to deactivate your user name or password due to security concerns.

Links to Other
Websites
If you see or use any links or conduits on our Websites and Apps which allow you to browse, redirect or visit any other websites, web pages or other internet or web-based locations, it does not mean that Benjamin Moore is associated with or has endorsed, reviewed or even knows anything about that site or page; and we have no obligation, responsibility or liability to you or anyone else if you go to another web site, page or address outside our Websites and Apps, even if a link on our site allowed you to do so. When you leave our Websites and Apps, you should confirm the terms and conditions, privacy and other policies that apply to you since Benjamin Moore neither controls, nor has any responsibility for any third party sites, their practices or anything associated with their operations. In fact, even if another web site or web page has the Benjamin Moore name, logo or other identification normally associated with us, it may or may not be authorized by us and you should not assume it is a Benjamin Moore Website or Benjamin Moore mobile application, unless it actually says so and the terms and conditions that apply to you are these Terms and Conditions.

Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
DISPUTES
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. ARBITRATION IS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO BRING SUIT IN COURT.
THIS SECTION CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
IF YOU ARE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and Benjamin Moore agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions (other than claims arising from national-estore.benjaminmoore.com) through final and binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may (1) bring an action in state or federal court solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of its intellectual property rights (for example, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, or patent rights, but not privacy or publicity rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above; and (2) seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. Thus, you agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to secure relief, and instead agree to the arbitration process as stated in this provision. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or Benjamin Moore must do the following things:
(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.
(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to your local JAMS office.
(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and Benjamin Moore will pay all other administrative costs and fees. In addition, for claims of less than $1,000, Benjamin Moore will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator rules in your favor. Arbitration under this Agreement shall be held in Bergen County, New Jersey; provided that if such location is inconvenient to you, you have the right to request that it be held at a reasonable location within the United States that is accessible to your place of residence. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Benjamin Moore; and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Benjamin Moore. The arbitrator's decision may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration (except those exempted from the arbitration requirement in the “WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE” paragraph above). Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Benjamin Moore in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND BENJAMIN MOORE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing Benjamin Moore at info@benjaminmoore.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of Terms and Conditions; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms and Conditions. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms and Conditions by using the website.
Choice of Law/Forum
Selection
These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, excluding its conflict of law rules. In any circumstances where these Terms and Conditions permit the parties to litigate in court, you specifically agree and submit to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal Courts situated in the State of New Jersey, City of Montvale and County of Bergen (or, for Federal Courts, Essex County). The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to these Terms and Conditions.
General Provisions
These Terms and Conditions are the entire agreement you have with Benjamin Moore regarding our Websites and Apps, Content and other subject matter set forth herein and supersede any and all prior or inconsistent understandings that may apply to the subject matter, except that the following also apply to matters within their scope and supersede these Terms and Conditions to the extent of any conflict:

If, for any reason, Benjamin Moore believes, has reason to believe, suspects or is notified of any act, omission or circumstances which may or could compromise or endanger the health, well-being or safety of any person, cause or lead to damage to persons or property (tangible or intangible), adversely affect, infringe upon or misappropriate the rights of others, harass or interfere with any other user or person, firm or enterprise, interfere with or bypass our security or other protective measures applicable to our systems, networks and communications capabilities, breach or violate these Terms and Conditions, including the Privacy Policy, Websites and Apps and Content or which violates any law or regulation, we have the right, reserving cumulatively all other rights and remedies available to us at law, in equity and under this agreement with you, to report and provide information to any and all regulatory and law enforcement authorities and agencies and take any action permitted by law.
Modification
These Terms and Conditions can only be modified by us as described above or by mutual written agreement, signed by an authorized representative of Benjamin Moore.
Headings
Headings are purely for reference and shall not affect the meaning of any term or condition.
Severability
The provisions of these Terms and Conditions are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable. In the event any provision or provisions are found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provisions shall be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary to render them valid, legal, and enforceable. It is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that such modification or restriction may be accomplished unilaterally by us or, alternatively, by disposition of a court of law or arbitrator. If such provisions cannot under any circumstances be so modified or restricted, they shall be excised from the Terms and Conditions without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions.
