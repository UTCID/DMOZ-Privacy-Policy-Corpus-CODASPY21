REDBRICK PIZZA® GIFT CARDS TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“Gift Card Rules”)
The REDBRICK PIZZA® Gift Card Terms and Conditions (this “Gift Card Rules”) is an agreement between you and RedBrick, and describes the terms and conditions that apply to your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card. By buying, loading, or using a REDBRICK PIZZA Gift Card, you agree to these terms. Please read the following provisions, as well as the complete REDBRICK PIZZA Terms of Use and Privacy Policy that govern the Sites.
These Gift Card Rules include an Arbitration provision that governs any disputes between you and us. This provision will: 1) Eliminate your right to a trial by jury; and 2) Substantially affect your rights, including preventing you from bringing, joining, or participating in class or consolidated proceedings.
ABOUT YOUR REDBRICK PIZZA GIFT CARD
REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards are not subject to any service fees or expiration dates. Your use of a gift card constitutes your acceptance of the complete Gift Card Rules (including the Arbitration provisions). REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards are redeemable for food, drink and eligible merchandise at participating REDBRICK PIZZA locations in the United States. Eligible merchandise or services are determined by RedBrick in its sole discretion and may be changed without notice. Gift cards cannot be used to purchase other gift cards and you will not receive Rewards points for the purchase of any gift card. Gift cards cannot be redeemed for cash or applied as payment to any REDBRICK PIZZA account, unless required by law. In California, all REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards are redeemable for cash upon request if the balance on the card is less than $10.00. REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards may be redeemable for cash when their balance falls below a certain amount in other states within the United States as well.
REDBRICK PIZZA ELECTRONIC GIFT CARDS
The REDBRICK PIZZA Electronic Gift Card program allows you to purchase and send a virtual REDBRICK PIZZA Card via email. You may choose the design and dollar value (within certain limits) and complete your purchase using a credit card, or debit card. You will need the email address for the recipient of your REDBRICK PIZZA Card eGift (also known as an “eGift” or “REDBRICK PIZZA eGift Card”). You authorize us to charge your credit card or debit card at the time you purchase your eGift.
We will send the recipient of your eGift an email notifying them that they have received an eGift from you. He or she will then be able to print out the eGift and bring it into a REDBRICK PIZZA location to make a purchase. An eGift is like a REDBRICK PIZZA gift card and should be treated like cash by the recipient.
Each eGift has a unique REDBRICK PIZZA gift card account number associated with it no matter how many times the email is printed out. We will only give refunds for unused eGifts with the original receipt.
ADDING VALUE TO YOUR REDBRICK PIZZA GIFT CARD
In the United States, you can load a dollar value on a REDBRICK PIZZA gift card by using a credit card, debit card or cash by visiting any participating REDBRICK PIZZA location. You may not load more than $500 worth of value on each REDBRICK PIZZA gift card. The minimum amount that must be loaded onto your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card is $5. RedBrick may change the maximum and minimum amounts at any time by notifying you at the point of sale, by phone when you call or on the Sites, and such change shall not constitute an amendment to these Gift Card Rules.
LOST, STOLEN OR DAMAGED GIFT CARD REPLACEMENT POLICY
Unless you have an original sales receipt for your gift card and your 16-digit gift card number, or unless it has been registered by you on www.redbrickpizza.com and you can provide us your email address or phone number that you used to register your gift card, the remaining gift card value will not be replaced if lost, stolen or damaged.
If you registered your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card with us, you can contact us via the Contact Us section of the Site or via your account balance page (go to disable my gift card) and we can deactivate your lost, stolen or damaged gift card and load the balance remaining at the time of notification onto a new gift card or REDBRICK REWARDS account.
You can also go into a participating REDBRICK PIZZA location, with your original receipt for the gift card purchase and your 16-digit gift card number or, again, if you registered the gift card with us and you can provide your email address or phone number that you used to register the gift card. The café personnel can deactivate your gift card and issue you a new gift card with the remaining balance.
If you cannot either go online or to a participating REDBRICK store and if your gift card has been lost, stolen or damaged, please mail: (1) the 16-digit gift card number (or if you registered your gift card with us, you can provide us with the email address or phone number used at the time of registration), (2) an original REDBRICK PIZZA location receipt indicating the purchase of the gift card, (3) a copy of a valid government issued I.D. (Driver’s License, Military I.D., or Passport), and (4) your complete name and mailing address to: Red Brick Pizza LLC, Attn: Gift Cards Replacement, 2811 McKinney Avenue, Suite 354, Dallas, TX 75204. Upon satisfactory receipt of these required information, RedBrick will cancel your old gift card and issue a new gift card in the amount of any remaining balance on your old gift card on the date of RedBrick’s receipt of the such information. The replacement gift card will be mailed to the address you provide, which must be a valid street address. P.O. Boxes will not be accepted. Please make a copy all documents you submit to us for your records. All documents submitted become RedBrick’s property and will not be returned. Please allow up to 8 weeks for delivery of the replacement gift card. RedBrick shall not be responsible for any lost, late, illegible, damaged, misdirected, incomplete or postage due mail. Reproduction, purchase, trade or sales of Report Form, gift card numbers, and or cash register receipts are prohibited. Fraudulent submissions may result in prosecution under applicable federal mail fraud statutes.
FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR REDBRICK PIZZA GIFT CARD OR CARD BALANCE
We will not accept any REDBRICK PIZZA gift card, or will limit use of any REDBRICK PIZZA gift card or gift card balance, if we reasonably believe that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful, and we consider such action appropriate to limit our risk. RedBrick does not control who may sell preloaded REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards, nor can we control the price or preloaded denominations offered by independent sellers. Consequently, RedBrick has no liability to you for any third party fraud or unlawful activity associated with any REDBRICK PIZZA gift card balance. If RedBrick discovers any REDBRICK PIZZA gift card or gift card balance was sourced or derived from fraud or other unlawful means, in our sole discretion, we may cancel all impacted REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards and retain all related REDBRICK PIZZA gift card balances without notice to you. We may use retained REDBRICK PIZZA gift card balances to help offset our liability to card companies, networks and issuers of lost or stolen credit and debit cards used to purchase or load REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards.
REGISTRATION, LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS
To register your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card, please visit www.redbrickpizza.com. When registering a REDBRICK PIZZA gift card, you agree that you will: (i) provide complete and accurate information about yourself; and (ii) update such information if it changes. If you do not provide or update such information, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that you have not provided or updated such information, we shall have the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to disable your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card. If you believe your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card has been disabled in error, please call (214) 302-5939. You are responsible for: (a) the accuracy of all information that you provide to us; and (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security of your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card information.
Because your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card is used like cash for purchases from participating REDBRICK PIZZA locations, you are responsible for all transactions associated with your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card, including unauthorized transactions. However, if your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card is lost, stolen or destroyed, the card can be replaced with the balance remaining on it at the time of your call, but only if you have registered it with us. Please notify us immediately if you change any of your registration information. If your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card becomes lost, stolen or damaged, you should contact us via the Contact Us section of the Site. Your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card balance is only protected from the point in time you notify us that your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card is missing. We will freeze the remaining balance on your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card at the time you notify us and will load that remaining balance on a replacement REDBRICK PIZZA gift card.
ARBITRATION
Please read this section carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of these Gift Card Rules.
This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Gift Card Rules, your REDBRICK PIZZA gift card and your relationship with us. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Gift Card Rules or use of the REDBRICK PIZZA gift card and your relationship with RedBrick or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.
Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if you opt out of this arbitration provision within 30 days from the earliest of the date you purchased, loaded, reloaded or used any of your REDBRICK PIZZA gift cards (the “Opt Out Deadline”) after these Gift Card Rules have gone into effect. You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by sending us a written notice that you opt out to the following address: Red Brick Pizza LLC, Attn: Customer Service, 2811 McKinney Ave., Ste. 354, Dallas, TX 75204. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline (allowing three (3) additional days for mailing) will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.
For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your claim to our Customer Service department to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within sixty (60) days. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org. You and we agree that these Gift Card Rules evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law. Any arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Gift Card Rules and this arbitration agreement as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.
Except for claims determined to be frivolous, upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay half of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial $200 filing fee. Each party will bear the fees and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.
You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this class action waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out procedure set forth above. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
These Gift Card Rules and this agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas not withstanding any conflict-of-laws rules.

The purchase of a REDBRICK gift card and/or redemption of REDBRICK REWARDS rewards are not qualified purchases; however, purchases (other than purchases of gift cards) made at a participating REDBRICK location using a REDBRICK gift card and/or a preloaded REDBRICK REWARDS card (other than use of any REDBRICK REWARDS rewards) are considered qualified purchases. You cannot use rewards to purchase REDBRICK gift cards. Please note that your reward points and rewards will expire upon the earlier of (a) 12 months of inactivity on your REDBRICK REWARDS card, or (b) the following reward points and rewards expiration schedule:
Earned $10 Rewards, which are $10 rewards we give you for every 1000 REDBRICK REWARDS points you earn, expire 90 days after you receive your reward.
Coupons and other rewards we may send you on a periodic basis (other than your Earned $10 Rewards) typically expire 30 days after you receive the coupon or reward.
The expiration date of coupons and rewards will be listed on your account balance.
The only way to redeem your rewards earned is by registering your REDBRICK REWARDS card and presenting your REDBRICK REWARDS card, your 16-digit REDBRICK REWARDS account number, or other identifiable information provided at time of registration (such as your email address or phone number that is linked to your Rewards account) at the time of check out. You must register you REDBRICK REWARDS card to redeem your rewards. You will, however, continue to accumulate reward points for qualified purchases in participating REDBRICK locations. You must provide us with your email address in order to register your Rewards account. You may elect to opt out of receiving marketing and promotional from RedBrick, however, if you do so, you will also be opting out of us sending to you special promotions, coupons and/or invitations to exclusive events from RedBrick.
If you want to combine your reward points and/or rewards from multiple cards, simply register the REDBRICK REWARDS card that you will keep as your primary REDBRICK REWARDS card and follow the steps to merge REDBRICK REWARDS accounts on the Site. If you have any questions or if you cannot complete the merger yourself online, you can always contact us via the Contact Us section of the Site with your request to combine multiple REDBRICK REWARDS cards. We will need the numbers of all REDBRICK REWARDS cards and you will need to indicate which REDBRICK REWARDS card is the primary card; we will transfer your reward points and/or rewards from the identified REDBRICK REWARDS cards to the one that you designate as your primary card, and then deactivate your other REDBRICK REWARDS cards.
USE OF YOUR REDBRICK REWARDS CARD AS A PREPAID/STORED VALUE CARD
Your REDBRICK REWARDS card allows you to load a dollar value on to it for future purchases at participating REDBRICK locations. The dollar value that you load onto your REDBRICK REWARDS card is a prepayment only for the goods and services of participating REDBRICK locations. No credit card, credit line, overdraft protection or deposit account is associated with a REDBRICK REWARDS card. Unless otherwise required by law or permitted by these RBP Loyalty Program Rules, any amount on your REDBRICK REWARDS card is nonrefundable and may not be redeemed for cash. No interest, dividends or any other earnings on funds deposited to a REDBRICK REWARDS card will accrue or be paid or credited to you by RedBrick. The value associated with the REDBRICK REWARDS card is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
Most REDBRICK locations in the United States accept your REDBRICK REWARDS card. Certain REDBRICK-branded locations may not permit you to use the REDBRICK REWARDS card for payment, including some special venue locations, or in stores located outside the United States. We reserve the right not to accept any REDBRICK REWARDS card or otherwise limit use of a REDBRICK REWARDS card if we reasonably believe that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful.
ADDING VALUE TO YOUR REDBRICK REWARDS CARD
Your REDBRICK REWARDS card can be used as a REDBRICK gift card. In the United States, you can load a dollar value on a REDBRICK REWARDS card by using a credit card, debit card or cash by visiting any participating REDBRICK location. You may not load more than $500 worth of value on each REDBRICK REWARDS card. The minimum amount that must be loaded onto your REDBRICK REWARDS Card is $5. RedBrick may change the maximum and minimum amounts at any time by notifying you at the point of sale, by phone when you call or on the Sites, and such change shall not constitute an amendment to these RBP Loyalty Program Rules.
RECEIPTS AND STATEMENTS
REDBRICK REWARDS cardholders are not sent statements of itemized transactions from a REDBRICK REWARDS card account. You can check the balance of your REDBRICK REWARDS card or review recent transactions on your REDBRICK REWARDS card by clicking here, or by calling (214) 302-5939. You will need to have your REDBRICK REWARDS card, your 16-digit REDBRICK REWARDS account number, or other identifiable information provided at time of registration (such as your email address or phone number that is linked to your Rewards account) available in order to access your account. The account balance for a REDBRICK REWARDS card or REDBRICK gift card also will appear on your receipt from a point-of-sale register. When you use your REDBRICK REWARDS card, you will receive a receipt if you request one but will not be asked to sign the receipt. The receipt will indicate that the purchase was made using a REDBRICK REWARDS card and will provide the remaining balance of your REDBRICK REWARDS card. You should keep your receipts and check your online statement to ensure that your account balance is correct.
BILLINGS AND ERROR CORRECTIONS
We reserve the right to correct the balance of your REDBRICK REWARDS card account if we believe that a clerical, billing or accounting error occurred. If you have questions regarding your transaction history or any correction, or if you dispute any transaction or correction that has been assessed against your REDBRICK REWARDS card, please contact us via our Contact Us page on the Site, or call (214) 302-5939. We will conduct an investigation and communicate the results and correct any error that we verify as soon as we finish the investigation. If no error was found, we will communicate an explanation. We shall have no liability for any billing error unless you provide us notice within 60 days of the date of the transaction in question. You should monitor your transactions and account balances closely.
FRAUD ASSOCATED WITH YOUR REDBRICK REWARDS CARD OR CARD BALANCE
We will not accept any REDBRICK REWARDS card, or will limit use of any REDBRICK REWARDS card or card balance, if we reasonably believe that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful, and we consider such action appropriate to limit our risk. RedBrick does not control who may sell preloaded REDBRICK REWARDS cards, nor can we control the price or preloaded denominations offered by independent sellers. Consequently, RedBrick has no liability to you for any third party fraud or unlawful activity associated with any REDBRICK REWARDS card balance. If RedBrick discovers any REDBRICK REWARDS card or card balance was sourced or derived from fraud or other unlawful means, in our sole discretion, we may cancel all impacted REDBRICK REWARDS cards and retain all related REDBRICK REWARDS card balances without notice to you. We may use retained REDBRICK REWARDS card balances to help offset our liability to card companies, networks and issuers of lost or stolen credit and debit cards used to purchase or load REDBRICK gift cards and REDBRICK REWARDS cards.
REPLACING A LOST OR STOLEN REDBRICK REWARDS CARD
If your REDBRICK REWARDS card is lost, stolen or destroyed, the card can be replaced with the balance remaining on it at the time of your call, but only if you have registered it with us. Please notify us immediately if you change any of your registration information. If your REDBRICK REWARDS card is ever lost or stolen, visit your local participating REDBRICK location and request a new REDBRICK REWARDS card. If you remember the 16-digit number of the REDBRICK REWARDS card you have lost or stolen or your email and/or phone number that you used when registering your Rewards account, a participating REDBRICK store will be able to deactivate your old card and issue you a new one. Your REDBRICK REWARDS card balance is only protected from the point in time you notify us that your REDBRICK REWARDS card is missing. We will freeze the remaining balance on your REDBRICK REWARDS card at the time you notify us and will load that remaining balance on a replacement REDBRICK REWARDS card. If you do not remember any of this information, you will need to obtain and register a new REDBRICK REWARDS account either in a participating REDBRICK location or online by contacting us via the Contact Us section of the Site; we are sorry but none of your Rewards points, rewards or balances can be transferred if you cannot remember the 16-digit number of the REDBRICK REWARDS card or the email address or phone number that you used to register your account.

When you return to REDBRICK REWARDS, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so that it is not necessary to enter your username and password to access certain functionality.
