such an item with You it is agreed by You that We, PlasTech Print by Badgemaster, can display this item on our website with relevant specifications with the intent to sell this item. If you do not
wish us to do this please mail us at ptpartroom@btconnect.com.
Additionally: If bespoke manufactured items are ordered, payment is required prior to commencement of manufacture.
Top
Sample Request
Every effort will be made to fulfill sample requests as specified by you. However, We are unable to guarantee the product will:
Be the exact size specified by You
Be the specific material colour You require
Be printed with any specific colours, or print type
In the majority of cases the sample will be dispatched the same working day to the address you specify, providing the request is received by us before midday. This excludes weekends and Bank
Holidays. Any sample request received by Us on a Friday will be dispatched the following Monday for delivery before 16:00 on the following Tuesday. Most sample requests will be sent free of charge though We reserve the right to charge a carriage fee, at cost, for certain postcodes and items.
VAT
Unless otherwise stated all prices exclude VAT which will be charged at the current UK rate.
Top

The order is Your first with Us
A period of 12 months has passed since Your last order
If bespoke manufactured items are ordered
Where a Pro Forma payment is required no order will be processed until proof of payment is supplied to Us.
Top
Quoted Prices
All prices quoted are based on print ready artwork being supplied to Us by You. In all cases quotes are subject to the sight of artwork. Where artwork is unavailable at the time of a quote request
from You to Us it is your responsibility to ensure the appropriate print method is requested. If a different print method to that initially quoted for becomes necessary to enable Us to meet Your
requirement We reserve the right to requote. Any additional costs incurred will be Your responsibility.
Top
Colours
Please note that when we are printing from your supplied artwork we cannot be held responsible for inaccurate reproduction. All digitally printed items are CMYK and therefore as accurate as is
technically possible but will not be pantone matched. All screen printed items will be pantone matched when specified by You. It is Your responsibility to supply US with the correct pantone
references.
Top
Proofs
Once an order has been submitted to Us by You We will send a proof for approval to the mail address that sent Us the original order, unless otherwise specified. It is Your responsibility to ensure
the proof is accurate before sending Us a proof approval. Additional terms and conditions relating specifically to proofs are contained within this mail, please read them carefully. No order will be
processed until a proof approval is sent to Us via email.
Top
Fonts/QR Codes
Occasionally when artwork is sent to Us it may contain fonts that We do not have within Our standard font library. In the event this is the case We will contact You for advice on how You wish Us
to proceed. This may involve Us asking You to supply Us with the font family required. In the event You do not have the required font We will attempt to match it as closely as possible to one of Our
stock fonts and send the artwork for proofing. If this process is unacceptable any additional costs for the new font family will be met by You. Due to the various devices that are utilised to access
QR Codes PlasTech Print by Badgemaster will not take any responsibility for the reproduction of any QR code that is subsequently found to not work correctly when scanned.

If goods are signed for unchecked and are subsequently found to be damaged then it is the customers responsibility to return them to us for repair/replacement. Regrettably we cannot offer a free
collection of damaged goods that have been accepted and signed for at time of delivery.
Should you order goods in error or be unhappy with you goods in any way then you should return them to us at your cost within 7 working days from date of delivery so we can inspect them. All
goods should be returned sealed, unused and in their original packaging. We cannot refund for items which have been opened, used or are damaged. Goods must be returned at the customers cost and we
strongly advise sending all goods via an insured service.
If delivery is attempted and no one is available to sign for the goods then the delivery will usually be re-attempted the following working day. After two failed delivery attempts goods will be
returned to PlasTech Print by Badgemaster and an additional delivery charge may be applied should you wish for us to re-dispatch the order.

Early/Late Deliveries
Early - We reserve the right to deliver any goods before the specified delivery date without any liability to You in whole or in part.
Late - We will always aim to avoid late deliveries but will not be liable for any additional costs to the customer as a result of bad weather or courier problems.
Force Majeure - We will always aim to keep You fully advised regarding potential delivery or production delays caused by problems outside of Our reasonable control, for example an inability
to procure materials or articles. Under such circumstances We shall be entitled to terminate any contract in whole or in part without liability to You.
Our contracted overnight courier service currently operates at about a 96% success rate. This means that next day deliveries are not 100% guaranteed. If you require a critical date or time for
your goods you may wish to consider alternative delivery options or arrange a collection from us.
