Third Party Service Providers: For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer your Personal Information to our third party service providers who use that information only to conduct Warrior Sports business. For example, these third party service providers may handle Warrior Sports credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, information analysis, promotions management and other services for Warrior Sports. We provide our preferred service providers with the Personal Information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your Personal Information.
Aggregated Data: We may use your Personal Information that is aggregated and no longer personally identifiable for purposes such as reporting and marketing and we may disclose aggregated information to various third parties.

Cooperative Databases: In connection with the distribution of our print catalogs and other marketing materials, we participate in cooperative data sharing databases. The participants of these databases provide customer names, mailing addresses and information about their customers' purchasing history to the database vendor which allows the database participants to segment and/or obtain access to potentially interested parties to which they may wish to target their own promotions. If you prefer not to have your name, email address and mailing address released to these cooperative databases, please let us know by sending an e-mail to customercare@warrior.com.
