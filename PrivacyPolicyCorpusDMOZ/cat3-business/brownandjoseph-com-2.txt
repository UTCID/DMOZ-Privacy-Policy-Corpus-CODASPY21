Legal Notice
HomeLegal NoticeLegal NoticeBrown & Joseph considers maintaining the confidence and trust of our customers to be our first priority. The company strives to protect the confidentiality and security of non-public personal information about our customers and their policyholders that is presented to us in the normal course of business. In light of the growth of computer technology, the development of internet commerce and the multiple changes in communications, the need for security of information becomes increasingly important to all of us.THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. A portion of that act addressed the manner in which insurance-related companies must treat non-public personal financial information that is in their records. It also requires that we provide our staff and contracted firms and individuals who have obtained our services for personal, family or household purposes, with a statement explaining our privacy policy and practices.WE DO NOT DISCLOSE ANY NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS OR FORMER CUSTOMERS TO ANYONE, EXCEPT AS PERMITTED BY LAW.THE INDEPENDENT FIELD REPRESENTATIVES who are authorized by contractual arrangements to complete assignments of our clients are not employees of our company but are subject to comply with our privacy policy. These representatives may have additional or different privacy practices as well.SECURITY FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS to our clients and their non-public personal information is a major concern of Brown & Joseph. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect this information from being accessed by unauthorized persons.
