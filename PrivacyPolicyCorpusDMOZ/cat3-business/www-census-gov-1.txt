Scientific Integrity
Our Nation relies on the products generated by the Federal statistical system to support the decisions of governments, businesses, households, and other organizations. The Census Bureau, along with our fellow Principal Statistical Agencies, has set a high standard of scientific integrity by embracing a common set of professional standards and operational practices designed to ensure the quality, integrity, and credibility of our statistical activities.
