Sizing
Does Little English have a size chart?
Size Chart
Little English runs true to size! If anything is running larger or smaller than usual, it will be noted in the product description. Example: if your child is wearing a 9M size in most brands right now, they would wear LE's 9M size as well. Size charts are available for certain products. These can be found on the item product page located right above the sizing options. See link below for example. The measurements will show shoulder to hem (STH) for tops, sweaters, dresses and skirts. Or shoulder to stride (STS) for bubbles, rompers,  john johns and shortalls. Size Chart Location
Crochet Playsuits
In the past, our signature Crochet Playsuits have run on the more generous side. In Fall 2017, LE remade the patterns for these best-sellers and they are now running true to size. All Newborn (NB) sizes of any Crochet Playsuit is a gown with snaps along the bottom.
Swimsuit Sizing
While we feel like Little English runs true to size, we do suggest sizing up in girl's one piece swimwear so that they can wear them longer! These styles run true to size, sometimes a bit small, depending on the child.
Newborn Sizing
When I choose the newborn size playsuit is it the same as pictured?
Our newborn size option is a sweet sac gown. This has picot detailing on the back and snaps for easy diaper changes.
