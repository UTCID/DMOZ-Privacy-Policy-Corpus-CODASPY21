policy in addition to ours. PLEASE READ THE PRIVACY POLICY
ON THE WEBSITE OF ANY PAYMENT PROCESSOR THAT YOU ARE DIRECTED TO REGARDING THE

Storage and Transfer of Personal Information
Your personal information and files
are stored on F2F's servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide
services to us. Your personal information may be transferred across national
borders because we have servers located in
India and Singapore and the companies we hire to help
us run our business may be located in different countries around the world.
The information that we collect from
you may be transferred to, and stored in, a country outside the European
Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. The laws in some countries may
not provide as much legal protection for your information as in the EEA. By
submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or
processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of
information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our
best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of
your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and
security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
Security of your information
We understand that the security of your personal information
is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
security controls to protect your personal information. Among other initiatives
that we take to maintain security of your data, we also utilize encryption of
personal data and strict access controls. At the same time, it is important for
you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. However,
despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and F2F cannot
ensure or warrant the security of your personal information.
Advertising and links to other sites
We display interest-based
advertising on both our sites and unaffiliated sites  using
information you make available to us when you interact with our sites, apps or
services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or
targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities including but not limited to purchasing of fibre2fashion magazine
on our site, your interaction with our Services and visiting sites that contain
F2F content or ads.
We use cookies, web beacons and
other technologies (collectively, “cookies and similar technologies”). Cookies
enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other
actions you take on our sites and other sites. This allows us to provide you
with more useful and relevant ads. For example, by knowing what ads you are
shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. For more
information about the use of cookies and similar technologies for
interest-based advertising, please refer to our cookie policy here .

Services and your activities over time and across different websites, including
through the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for,
third-party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies. F2F is not
responsible for the privacy practices of these entities. In addition, our
Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us.

privacy policies or practices. If you provide any personal information through
any such third-party website, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with
the privacy policies and practices of that third party.

Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google (collectively, “Social Network”)

collect relevant information necessary to enable our Services to access that
Social Network and your data contained within that Social Network. We may share
your information with the operator of that Social Network to facilitate or
enhance delivery of that Social Network or other services to you. A Social

Privacy of Children
We recognize the
importance of children's safety and privacy. We do not request, or knowingly

California Do Not Track
F2F does not have a
mechanism in place for responding to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms used to
limit collection of information for use in Online Behavioural Advertising.
There currently is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do
Not Track" means in this context. Therefore, like many websites and online
services, the Services do not alter their practices when they receive a
"Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more
about "Do Not Track," please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Policy, please write to us at
