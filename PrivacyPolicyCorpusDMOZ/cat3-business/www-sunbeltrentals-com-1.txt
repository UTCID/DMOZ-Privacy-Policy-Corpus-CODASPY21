Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. We may, however, disclose your personal information in the following limited circumstances:

For example, from time to time, we may engage companies and individuals to perform certain services on our behalf (such as conducting audits, performing legal services, processing credit card payments or providing customer service). These third-party service providers may have access to personal information, but only to the extent required to perform their assigned roles and they may not use your personal information for any other reason.
As necessary to protect the safety or security of users of the Website, to detect and prevent fraud or abusive behaviour, or when otherwise required or permitted by law.
In the event that we sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the business to an affiliate, successor, assign or other third party entity. As our business continues to evolve, we may wish to sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information (including personal information) generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the terms of any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
