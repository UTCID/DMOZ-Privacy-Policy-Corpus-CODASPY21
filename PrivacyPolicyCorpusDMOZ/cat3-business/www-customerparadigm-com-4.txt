Jeff FinkelsteinFounder Customer ParadigmGoogle Ads Help Expert Since 2002
A note from Customer Paradigm’s founder, Jeff Finkelstein:
My passion is helping businesses like yours leverage the power of the Web to aggregate customers according to interest, and not geography. 12,600+ projects later, I still love what we’re doing, and I love that the premise of the company – customer-centric thinking – is still just as valid and relevant today as it was back in 2002.
I’ve been using Google Ads since it started. And over the years, I’ve helped hundreds of clients stop wasting money on Google Ads, and help them create more effective campaigns.
What’s my secret? Customer-centric thinking.
The name of the company I founded in 2002, Customer Paradigm, was based on the assumption that end customers increasingly have control over their purchasing experience. Buying online, interacting with people based on interest instead of geography – all of this was made possible by the Web.
In 2002, we helped businesses with three things: Acquiring new customers, retaining existing ones, and interacting with them online.
In 2019, the underlying goals are the same, but strategies and tactics are in many cases radically different.
My favorite part of the day is talking to business owners like you to offer Google Ads help and discuss your digital marketing goals.
I’d love to see if there’s anything I can recommend that may make your site or your brand more successful.
Let me know – I can meet here in Boulder, or over the phone – 303.473.4400.
Thanks! – Jeff
