WHAT WE BELIEVE
The Bible, consisting of all the books of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, only infallible, authoritative Word of God. The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are without error or misstatement in their moral and spiritual teaching and record of historical facts. They are without error or defect of any kind.
There is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in his virgin birth, his eternal, personal pre-existence, his sinless life, his miracles, his vicarious and atoning death through his shed blood, his bodily resurrection, his ascension to the right hand of the Father, and his personal return in power and glory.
For the salvation of lost and sinful men, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential.
The present ministry of the Holy Spirit is to indwell and enable the Christian to live a godly life.
Resurrection is of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.
