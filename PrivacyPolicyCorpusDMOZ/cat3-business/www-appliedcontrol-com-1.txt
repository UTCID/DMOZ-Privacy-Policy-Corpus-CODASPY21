You may provide us with certain personal information directly when you interact with us through one of our websites, for example, when you register on one of our websites, when you subscribe for an e-mail newsletter, or when you register to use certain services. Additionally, several of the services that we offer on our websites may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register with one of our websites you are no longer anonymous to us. We may also receive information about you from other sources including our suppliers and service providers and add it to the information you provided to us.
The types of personal information that you may directly provide us includes, without limitation:
Contact information, such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number;
Demographic information, such as age, date of birth, gender, job information;

Your educational history with us, such as the courses that you have enrolled in or attended
Information from Use of Website. Your Internet browser has a feature called “cookies” which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our websites. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
We may use technologies, including electronic images–sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons–that allow us to track general user traffic patterns. We may also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our websites, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you unless you have specifically given us personally identifiable information, in which case we use that information to enhance your services in the ways described below.
The information that we collect through automated means may include:
Information about the devices used to access our websites;
Dates, times, and durations of visits and return visits to our websites;
Anonymous, aggregated (data collected in mass), statistical information on website usage; and
Usage information regarding the features of our websites.
Additionally, we use certain third-party service providers, including specifically Google Analytics and Constant Contact, to assist us by providing analytics information for our websites and communications.

We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.
Sharing Personal Information with Others
We may disclose aggregated or de-identified information about our users without restriction. We do not sell customer lists or personal information to others and only disclose personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In providing you with our products, solutions and services, we may need to disclose the personal information we collect to suppliers or subsidiaries. This is for the sole purpose of providing you with the right solution for your need and serving you better. Additionally, we may provide your contact information to an appropriate third-party partner in the event that you contact us for information or services that we do not provide. For example, if you request information about equipment from outside of our geographic area of operation, we will make sure to connect you with a third-party partner that serves your location so that you can get the answers you need.
We may also use the information that we collect to assess your future needs and to offer the products and services that may best meet those needs. In these cases, should you not wish to hear from us in this manner, we will do our best to provide a simple method for you to have your name and information removed upon request.
We may need to share your personal information to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions and other agreements; or if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Applied Control, users of the Applied Control websites, or others.
We also reserve the right to transfer your personal information to a buyer or other transferee in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, sale, or other transfer of some or all of our assets. Should such a sale, merger, or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.
How We Safeguard Personal Information
At Applied Control, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect our systems and personal information under our control against unauthorized access and use.

Employees are governed by standards and policies to ensure that personal information is secure and treated with care and respect.
