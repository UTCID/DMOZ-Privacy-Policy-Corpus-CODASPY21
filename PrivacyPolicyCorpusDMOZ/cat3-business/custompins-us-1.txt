You exceeded my expectations, big time!
John, I got my pins in the mail yesterday and was I impressed. they look FANTASTIC!!! After sending in my artwork ideas from a PowerPoint slide I put together, I doubted you would be able to get all that text on a small pin and it would still be legible and readable. You exceeded my expectations, big time! I especially like the gold border you placed around the design. That added that extra something special. I am sure that our club members will be very proud to own their pins and it will now be a tradition to have a new one made every year. (I know who we will be ordering them from.) Thank you especially for answering my emails and keeping me posted on the production and shipping dates. That really meant a lot to me. Sincerely, Kevin

Even better than the original.
Hi John! I just got our pins this afternoon. Thank you so much they look great! Even better than the original. I love how the lettering is so much clearer and the colors are brighter than in our old pins. Thanks again for completing our order so quickly. And your prices saved our organization a lot of money. We will definitely recommend your company to other groups in our area! Lynda

There must be twice as much detail as my last pins.
John Just letting you know I received my pins Saturday. They are incredible! There must be twice as much detail as my last pins. Are you using an entirely different process or something? I might have drawn them differently if I had known you could do so much detail. The colors are good and I think I'm going to like the safety pin backs. I wish I had the money to have all the different designs made that I want. This is so much fun! Another happy customer, Teresa

The pins look great.
John, The pins look great. The logo designer and self proclaimed pin/patch expert (my wife) is very pleased, too. In all fairness, she has a strong background in art and has designed logos for a number of emergency service groups that have been turned into pins and patches. Thanks for the great service. I plan to work on a different pin and will probably contact you in a few months. Have a great summer. Steve

Really nice, clean, crisp coloring
Hi John. Just wanted to give you some feedback on the pins... First, they look terrific. Really nice, clean, crisp coloring, and it looks great on the brass/gold colored background metal. I already sold ten toward our charity, and hopefully we'll get the rest in circulation as the season progresses. A few people liked them so much that they are considering doing pins for their chapters and our fan club may consider having pin sets made for the club... I'll keep you posted. Thanks again! Dave

When I recieved the pin my eyes dropped to the floor.
Hello mr.John how are you sir,  I  wrote you before and didn't know for sure if you recieved my email. But  I  just want to say thank you again for a job well done. I just cant thank you enough for the superb work on the pin that you have done. I know  I  must have been a pest, but you did assure me that the finished product would meet my satisfaction. When  I  recieved the pin my eyes dropped to the floor. Also when  I  had shown the pin to the other staff of the security department at church, they were overwhelmed at the craftsmanship and could not wait to show it off for that sunday. Thank you so much again for our pins which  I  know you'll be hearing from me again , due to the other departments at church wanting to create their own pins also. God...
