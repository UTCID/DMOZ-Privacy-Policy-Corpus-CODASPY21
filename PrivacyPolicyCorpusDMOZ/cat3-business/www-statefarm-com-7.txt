General FAQ
What is a simple interest loan?
What is a simple interest loan?
Simple interest is a way of allocating monthly loan payments between the principal and interest. The amount of your loan payment that is allocated to interest is based on the unpaid portion of the principal balance, the interest rate on your loan, and the number of days since your last payment. For example, if we receive a payment 20 days since your last payment, you will then be charged 20 days of interest on the unpaid principal balance of your loan. The rest of your payment is credited to the principal which reduces the unpaid principal balance on your loan.
How is interest calculated on my auto loan?
How is interest calculated on my auto loan?
State Farm Bank® vehicle loans are simple interest loans. Simple interest calculations are used for installment loans:
The remaining principle is multiplied by the interest rate to calculate the total interest for one year.
The annual interest is divided by the number of the days in the year to calculate the interest per day.
The interest per day is multiplied by the number of days between payments to calculate the amount due each payment.
Example:
A $20,000 loan at 8.49% APR = $1698.00 (annual interest)
$1698.00 / 365 = $4.652 (daily interest)
$4.652 x 30 = $139.56 (monthly interest)
However, the first month the loan is due, $4.652 would be multiplied by the number of days from the date the funds are disbursed to the date the payment is processed.
Who holds my title?
Who holds my title?
In most states, State Farm Bank® holds the title to a vehicle. However, in title-holding states you hold the title to your vehicle with our lien on it. A few states have an electronic title that the state retains electronically.
If State Farm Bank® holds the title or has a lien on the title, it will be released to you on the 10th business day after the payoff is received, processed, and all other conditions are satisfied. Please allow for normal mail time.
Note: If you live in a state that retains titles electronically, time frames may vary.

How are payments applied to my loan?
How are payments applied to my loan?
Prepayments of principal and overpayments will be applied first to any outstanding late fees, then to principal of the next payment installment and will reduce or satisfy the next scheduled payment due. If your monthly payment is being made via recurring ACH or Auto-pay, this may prevent or reduce the amount of your next automatic payment.
If the bill is due, the payment will be applied as follows:
Accrued interest since last payment received
Principal
Outstanding late fees due
If no bill is due, the payment will be applied as follows:
Outstanding late fees due
Accrued interest since last payment received
Principal of future bille(s) due
Additional principal reduction is applied towards the next bill due (reduces the principal balance but will also reduce or satisfy the next bill(s) due).
Note: Interest accrues on any unpaid principal balance of the loan.
State Farm Bank cannot guarantee that a postdated check will be honored for the date indicated. All checks received are processed the same day they are received. A $25 Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) fee will be applied to the loan for all returned payment items.
