Terms of Use
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.
APRIA HEALTHCARE LLC
TERMS OF USE
Apria Healthcare LLC (“Apria”) offers the Apria.com website, which includes the ApriaDirect.com e-commerce site and other Apria-affiliated platforms, applications and online services (collectively, the “Website” or “Site”) to the user subject to the user’s acceptance of the terms, conditions, and notices contained in these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use apply to your use of or visit to the Website and all functions or features of the Website, as well as all offers, sales, purchases and rentals of products or services sold through the Website.
BY ACCESSING AND USING THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY NOT USE THE WEBSITE., BY USING THE WEBSITE YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS OF USE AS YOUR BINDING AGREEMENT.
These Terms of Use include an Arbitration provision that governs any disputes between you and us. Unless you opt out, as described below, this provision makes it mandatory that the parties submit disputes which are not otherwise resolved to a neutral third-party arbitrator for a binding decision and will eliminate your right to pursue a claim through a trial in a court by a judge or jury and substantially affect your rights, by preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class or consolidated proceedings.
Apria reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use in its sole discretion from time to time. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of such changes constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of these changes.
You further agree and acknowledge that certain Apria products, services, and offerings made available through the Website may be subject to additional or different terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and those additional or different terms and conditions, those additional or different terms and conditions shall govern.
If you or your representative have signed a Sales, Service and Rental Agreement with Apria, that document will cover the products and services you received pursuant to it and your relationship generally with Apria and these Terms of Use will apply only to your use of the Website and any products and services purchased or rented on it.
YOUR ACCOUNT
Customers of Apria may register for an account. As part of the registration process, you will create a username and password. You are responsible for maintaining and promptly updating your account information for accuracy and completeness, including your address, phone number and email address in order for us to communicate with you. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of, and restricting access to, your account and password. You agree to accept full responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password, including use of your account by any third party using your username and password.

ORDER ACCEPTANCE; PAYMENT
Apria will only accept orders for shipment to addresses within the United States in accordance with our Shipping and Return Policy. Payment must be made by a U.S.-issued credit/debit card or some other pre-arranged method of payment acceptable to Apria. Apria reserves the right to accept or decline your order or limit the order quantity for any reason.  If Apria limits the order quantity, you will be notified and have the right to cancel your order. Where payment is made by credit/debit card, such payment is subject to the approval of the financial institution issuing the credit/debit card, and Apria will not be liable in any way if such financial institution refuses to accept or honor the credit/debit card for any reason. Apria may require, at Apria’s option, that any order placed over a certain dollar amount receive Apria’s pre-approval. Apria may also require additional verification or information before accepting any order. An order is deemed accepted upon Apria’s shipment of the products ordered, and Apria will charge your credit/debit card upon such shipment.
ORDER CANCELLATION
Once an order has been placed, it cannot be cancelled. However, you may refuse delivery of your order upon receipt or return your order in accordance with our Shipping and Return Policy.

Although we attempt to accurately reflect product availability on the Website, Apria cannot guarantee product availability and products may not be available for immediate delivery. Apria reserves the right, without liability or prior notice, to revise, discontinue, or cease to make available any or all products, or to cancel any order. If there is any revision, discontinuance or cessation, Apria may, at its discretion, ship products which have substantially similar functionality and specifications to the products ordered, or cancel your order and refund any prior payment that you have made for such products.  If Apria substitutes a similar product for the one you ordered, you will be notified and have the right to cancel your order.
INACCURACIES; TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS
Apria attempts to be accurate when providing information or listing product details on the Website. Products offered for sale on the Website may contain descriptions provided by the manufacturer, developer or distributor of the product.

If your credit/debit card has already been charged for the transaction and your order is cancelled, Apria will issue a credit to your credit/debit card account for the amount of the charge.
TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS

Section 512(c)(3) for further details): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Apria to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit Apria to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an email address at which you may be contacted; (e) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Section 512(g)(3) for further detail): (a) your physical or electronic signature; (b) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and (d) your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Apria may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under these Terms or Use (that is, the person who alleged that your material infringed any copyright) or an agent of such person.
Apria’s policy is to suspend or terminate the account, or the right to access or use the Website or any part of the Website, of any person who posts infringing material on the Website or who provides any fraudulent or inaccurate take-down notice or counter-notice under the DMCA. However, Apria has no obligation to do so.
USER COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER CONTENT
Users of the Website may be permitted to post reviews, comments and other content and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” Such user-generated content does not reflect the opinions or policies of Apria.

Apria takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content or materials posted by you or any third party.
WEBSITE AVAILABILITY AND SECURITY
At any time and from time to time, all or any portion of the Website may not be available or may not function properly. The Website may have and may cause technological problems for any reason, including viruses and other malicious or damaging computer programs. Apria disclaims liability for any interception of data or communications. Apria does not guarantee the security of the Website. Apria is not liable for any damage or injury caused by the performance or failure of performance of all or any portion of the Website or for any defects, delays or errors in or resulting from your use of the Website.
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
When you visit the Website or send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically unless you opt out from receiving such communications where available. We will communicate with you by email or by posting notices to the Website. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, or other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
TELEPHONE/COMMUNICATION CONSENTS
IN PROVIDING YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER TO APRIA ON THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE AND CONSENT TO APRIA CONTACTING YOU ON THAT TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR ANY PURPOSE (INCLUDING SALES, MARKETING, PROMOTIONAL OFFERS, CUSTOMER CARE, AND/OR COLLECTIONS). YOU FURTHER AUTHORIZE APRIA AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS TO USE ANY CELLULAR OR OTHER TELEPHONE NUMBER AND/OR EMAIL ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO APRIA OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES OR AGENTS, AND, IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH CALLS, TO USE PRE-RECORDED/ARTIFICIAL VOICE MESSAGES AND/OR AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY TELEPHONE CALLS BETWEEN YOU AND APRIA (INCLUDING ANY APRIA REPRESENTATIVES OR AGENTS) MAY BE MONITORED OR RECORDED BY APRIA OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES OR AGENTS.
DISPUTES – BINDING ARBITRATION
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Website, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Apria or through the Website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except as otherwise permitted in these Terms of Use.
If you fail to reach satisfactory resolution concerning any claim or dispute with Apria and provided there has been a reasonable amount of time allowed to resolve the claim or dispute, then, and only then, will you have the option to continue to pursue the claim or dispute through binding arbitration with Apria or, solely to the extent provided below, in court.
You and Apria hereby agree to arbitrate all disputes between us, except as provided below.  This arbitration agreement covers any dispute arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between Apria and you with regard to use of the Website and all products and services purchased or rented at the Website, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, including, but not limited to:  (i) claims that arose before this or any prior agreement, or which may hereafter arise; (ii) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iii) claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.  You or Apria may start an arbitration proceeding by sending to the other(s), by certified mail, a letter requesting arbitration (the “Demand”). If the arbitration is started by a party other than the Apria, the Demand must be sent to Apria’s Legal Department at 26220 Enterprise Court, Lake Forest, California 92630 (the “Notice Address”). The Demand must (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (B) set forth the relief sought. The Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use will govern the arbitration.  You and Apria agree that (i) any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in court or arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action, (ii) neither Apria nor you, shall be a member in a class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding, (iii) the arbitrator is authorized to award relief only on an individual basis, and (iv) Apria and you, are each waiving the right to a trial by jury.  Apria does not consent to class arbitration; accordingly, if a court or arbitrator refuses to enforce clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, then the agreement to arbitrate shall be unenforceable as to you.  These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and, therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the arbitration agreement set forth in this paragraph, Apria may assign any delinquent  accounts for collection, and Apria may pursue in court claims limited to the collection of past due amounts, unless you demand that the issue be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions contained in these Terms of Use.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW AND/OR PURSUE CERTAIN SMALL CLAIMS IN COURT. Claims may be pursued in court, as opposed to arbitration, if: (i) the claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over the parties is proper, in which case proceedings may be initiated in small claims court; or (ii) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU MAKE YOUR FIRST PURCHASE ON THE WEBSITE (THE “OPT-OUT DEADLINE”).  You may opt out by doing either of the following before the Opt-Out Deadline: (i) enter the decision to opt out of arbitration on the Company’s website by clicking here and following the instructions, or (ii) call the Company’s Arbitration Opt-out Line at 1-866-494-5396 and leave a recorded message indicating your name and address and the fact that the right to opt out of arbitration is being exercised.
Additional Information About Arbitration with the Company:  The arbitrator must follow the arbitration provisions contained in these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court could.  Decisions of the arbitrator will be conclusively binding upon all parties, and judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Please refer to Apria’s additional arbitration procedures, which form a material part of and are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use, by clicking here.
APPLICABLE LAW
By using the Website or any product or service sold or distributed by Apria or through the Website, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Apria.

If, for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction finds any term or condition in these Terms of Use to be unenforceable, all other terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect.

ASSIGNMENT
You will not transfer or assign any rights or licenses granted to you pursuant to these Terms of Use, and any purported assignment or other transfer in violation of this paragraph will be null and void and of no force or effect.
