It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.
The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

ORDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The order that has been accepted by Seller which acceptance incorporates these Terms and Conditions is subject to availability and at Seller’s prices in effect at the date of shipment of order.
The order will be processed with every effort to meet the required shipping date, but the Seller is not obligated to make delivery by any specified date nor liable for damages due to delay in filling this order.
Specified shipping dates are Seller’s best estimates but are not guarantees.
Failure of Buyer to pay any invoice for goods shipped, whether under this order or any prior or subsequent order, shall constitute a breach of all such orders permitting Seller to suspend deliveries until such breach is cured or to cancel all orders.
Seller’s election to suspend deliveries shall not preclude it from subsequently cancelling an order.
Neither Seller nor Buyer will be liable for default or delay, in whole or in part, in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder due to any cause beyond its control, including, but not limited to, Acts of God, accident, fire, flood, storm, riot, war, sabotage, explosion, strike, labor disturbances, national defense requirements, Governmental law, regulation, rule or ordinance, whether valid or invalid, inability to obtain energy, raw materials, labor or transportation under reasonable terms and conditions, or any similar or different contingency which make performance commercially impracticable.
Seller warrants that the goods supplied hereunder meet Seller’s standard specification for the goods. Seller makes no other warranties, express or implied, and none shall be created.
Seller makes no warranty as to merchantability or as to fitness for a particular purpose of the goods sold.
All recommendations, statements, and technical data regarding goods are based on test which Seller believes to be reliable and correct, but accuracy and completeness of such tests and results thereof are not guaranteed and are not to be construed as a warranty, either express or implied.
It is expressly understood by Buyer that all such recommendations, statements, and technical data are provided without charge to Buyer and are given by Seller and accepted by Buyer on the basis that Buyer shall perform its own evaluation and testing to determine the suitability and applicability of such products.
Seller assumes no obligation or liability for advice given or results obtained, all such advice given and accepted at Buyer’s sole risk.
Seller shall not be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
Buyer acknowledges receipt of Technical Documentation detailing application and performance properties, including important safety and health precautions and instructions regarding use of goods.
Unless Seller is notified immediately in writing by Buyer to contrary, Buyer will be deemed to have read and understood contents of such Technical Documentation, including said safety and health precautions necessary.
