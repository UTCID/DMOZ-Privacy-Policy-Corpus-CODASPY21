Help & FAQs
At Regions we are committed to helping you protect yourself from fraud. To demonstrate this commitment, we have compiled helpful information to enable you to protect your personal privacy and financial security.
You can deter potential fraud with these simple tips:
Watch It
Monitor your bank, credit card, brokerage and other financial account activity regularly. Report anything that looks suspicious immediately.
Check your credit report. You are entitled to a free credit report each year. To order, visit annualcreditreport.com, call 1-877-322-8228 or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.
Protect It
Don’t respond to unsolicited emails, phone calls or text messages asking for account or credit card numbers, usernames, passwords or other personal information. Learn more about What Phishing is and How You Should Report It.
Don’t share sensitive personal information on social media sites or respond to messages from unreliable sources.
Shred financial statements that contain personalized information.
If you receive an email, letter or phone call that you suspect might not be from Regions, please contact us to confirm the source.
Prevent It
Use strong passwords. Passwords should contain a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. Don’t write down or share your passwords.
Don’t repeat passwords you’ve used before. Create a new, unique password each time so that if one account is compromised, hackers can’t use that information to access other accounts, as well.
Install the latest firewall and antivirus software. Learn more about Tools to Protect Yourself Online.
Remember that many public Wi-Fi connections may not have the same security layers as secured networks and therefore may not be as safe for accessing accounts.
