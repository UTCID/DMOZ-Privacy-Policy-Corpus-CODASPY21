SOUNDCLICK TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WEB SITE USE
Set forth below are the terms and conditions (these "Terms and Conditions") governing the SoundClick Inc web site located at, or linked to through, the root URL www.soundclick.com,
which may expand or change from time to time (the "Website"). As used herein, the term "SoundClick" refers to SoundClick Inc., the sole owner and operator of the Website; the term
"you" or "your" refers to an individual, representing yourself or, if applicable, acting as legal representative for a group, business entity or corporation.
CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BY AVAILING YOURSELF OF THE WEBSITE OR RELATED SERVICES, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS SUCH TERMS MAY BE MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
Use of Materials Found on the Website: The information, artwork, text, video, audio, pictures, software and other intellectual property (collectively, "Materials") contained on the Website are protected
by copyright and international laws. You may only access and use the Materials for personal or educational purposes or as expressly provided for in applicable SoundClick program terms and conditions.
You may not otherwise reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, modify or create derivative works of the Materials, unless authorized by the appropriate copyright owner(s). In the event that you print
Materials found on the Website, you must include any copyright notice originally included with the Materials on all copies. You may not link directly to any media file located on a SoundClick server, except where
explicitly allowed to do so. You should not attempt to claim any Materials as your own work. Any computer software downloadable or otherwise available on the Website is provided subject to the terms of the applicable
license agreement. Before using any SoundClick logo or trademark, please contact SoundClick.
Copyright and Trademark Infringement Policy and Notification Procedure: SoundClick does not own the musical compositions, sound recordings, art or other written or visual images (collectively, the "Content")
posted by third parties to the Website. All Content is posted by an individual, group or company (collectively, the "Artist") who has represented and warranted to SoundClick that, among other things, neither the Content
nor the names, trademarks and service marks under which Content is promoted (collectively, the "Name") infringes any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, rights of publicity
or privacy, or moral rights (see the section titled 'Representations and Warranties' of the current SoundClick Music Submission Agreement at https://www.soundclick.com/docs/legal.cfm).
Please see our Copyright Policy / DMCA page for details about our policy, and how to report copyright infringements.
Refund policy: SoundClick does not offer refunds. If there are any issues with a premium service, promotional order, or MP3 Store purchase, please contact SoundClick immediately
at support@soundclick.com, as we aim to solve every issue amicably. Premium services (recurring billings) can be cancelled anytime for any reason. Cancellations by the individual,
group, or company that signed up for the premium service (collectively, the "Subscriber") will be effective after the paid period. In case of cancellation by the Subscriber, the period that is already paid for will not be
reimbursed. The premium service(s) will then remain active until the end of the paid period. SoundClick reserves the right to cancel premium services for any reason at any time without notification. If you have a balance
resulting from sales in SoundClick's MP3 store in excess of US $5.00, and your account is in good standing, SoundClick aims to transfer the remaining balance to your PayPal account as soon as possible.
Premium services can be cancelled at any time by emailing support@soundclick.com with your cancellation request and artist name or order ID. Cancellations will be confirmed by
us through email. Only when you receive a confirmation email does the cancellation become effective. If you do not receive a reply to your cancellation email within 24 hours, please resend your cancellation request in the
case that the original did not go through.
Your Conduct: You shall use the Website for lawful purposes only. You shall not post or transmit via the Website any material which violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others, which is unlawful,
threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense,
give rise to civil liability
or otherwise violate any law, or which, without SoundClick's express prior approval, contains advertising or any solicitation with respect to products or services. You shall not use any play- or page-increasing software or
services. SoundClick reserves the right to cancel accounts for any reason at any time without notification.
In addition, if we feel that a user abuses the SoundClick site in any way, we reserve the right to share certain information with third parties. Abuses include (but are not limited to) possible copyright infringement,
