Privacy and Terms
TGI FRIDAYS™ Privacy Policy
TGI Friday’s Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Fridays”) are committed to respecting your privacy. We want to make your online and mobile experiences satisfying and safe. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process information through this website (“Site”) and our mobile application (“mobile application” or “app”) in the United States. We will not use or share your information except as described in this Privacy Policy.
We urge you to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment. By using this Site or app, or signing up for Fridays Rewards™ Loyalty Program (“Fridays Rewards”), you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Fridays complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as set forth by the European Parliament in April 2015. The regulation mandates that Fridays protects the personal data and privacy of EU data subjects. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the GDPR, the GDPR principles shall govern with respect to EU residents.
Fridays also complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as set forth by the latest available regulations. The CCPA applies to California consumers, and grants those consumers certain rights relating to the control of their personal information which has been collected or used by businesses. As to the data of California Consumers, in the event of a conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the CCPA, the CCPA principles shall govern.
Consent
Fridays collects information about you in connection with many of our services. When working with us or using our Site or app, you may be prompted to make an account which may hold Personal Information, such as your name, birthdate, mailing address, email address, or credit card information. Prior to collecting information, Fridays will obtain your consent. At any point in time, you can revoke consent and we will cease using and processing your data immediately.
Fridays gives you choices about the ways we collect, use, and share your personal information. You can choose what contact and financial information will be stored in your account and preferences. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences with us may be affected.
In some jurisdictions, in addition to you agreeing to this Privacy Policy, data privacy laws may require us to obtain a separate consent before we send you information that you have not specifically requested. In certain circumstances, your consent may be implied (e.g. where communications are required in order to fulfill your requests and/or where you have volunteered information for use by us). In other cases, we may seek your consent expressly in accordance with applicable laws (e.g. where the information collected is regarded to be Sensitive Personal Information under local regulations).
Access to Update/Delete Personal Information
You have the right to access and limit the use and disclosure of your personal data. Fridays provides you many opportunities to access and update your Personal Information. You can ensure that any account, contact, or financial information is up-to-date and you can correct, update, or delete inaccuracies to the information by logging into your account or contacting Fridays at Contact Us. Fridays will attempt to answer all requests that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete it, provided Fridays is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.
In addition, to protect your privacy, we will require you to prove your identity before granting access to, or agreeing to update, correct or delete your Personal Information and we will only implement requests with respect to Personal Information about you (not anyone else).
A Note Specific to EU Data Subjects
Any personal information collected about EU data subjects via our Site or mobile app is processed in the United States of America by Fridays or by a third party acting on our behalf. When you provide personal information to Fridays, you consent to the processing of your information in the United States. Our websites are hosted in the United States. If, at any point in time, you wish to know what data we process about you, you can request to access the information by completing the GDPR Contact Us online form.

A NOTE SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS
Your Rights Regarding Your Information
If you are a consumer, as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), you have a right to request that Fridays disclose to you the categories of personal information we have collected from you, the categories of sources from which such information has been collected, the business or commercial purpose for which your information has been collected, the categories of third parties with whom your personal information is shared, and the specific pieces of personal information that have been collected about you. You also have a right under the CCPA to request disclosure of your personal information which has been sold by a business, and to opt-out of that sale, however Fridays does not sell consumer personal information other than as described in this Privacy Policy and has not sold any consumer personal information in the last 12 months. To exercise your right to disclosure and request these details about your personal information collected by Fridays, you can make that request using the CCPA Contact Us form or by calling us at 1-800-374-3297. Because, for your security, we require you to prove your identity before granting access to your information, we will either ask you to authenticate your Fridays Rewards account with us, or we will ask you for your name, address, phone number, and email address. The information we collect from you in connection with this verification of your identity will be used solely for the purposes of verification.
Additionally, you have the right to request that we delete personal information that we may have collected from you.

The information we collect from you in connection with this verification of your identity will be used solely for the purposes of verification. Note that we will still retain information, pursuant to California Civil Code section 1798.105(d), if retention of the information is necessary to:
Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between us and you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity.

Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, but only if you have provided informed consent.
To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.
You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your disclosure and deletion rights under the CCPA. If you wish to do this, you must provide the agent with written permission to exercise your rights, and you must verify your own identity with us. If you wish to designate an agent in this way, please call us at 1-800-374-3297.
You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights under the CCPA, and we never discriminate in any way against consumers who choose to exercise any of these rights.
What information do we collect?
Personal Information
We only collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily submit such information on our Site or when using our app. We use this information for the specific purpose for which it was provided, such as registering for Fridays Rewards, entering a contest, participating in a survey, finding a Fridays™ location, making a reservation, ordering online (where applicable) and other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. “Personal Information” refers to any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, such as an identification number, physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identifiers. Personal Information by collected may include the following: name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact data (including email address, telephone number, and physical address), and online identifiers like social media handles, if provided.
Non-personal Information
We may also collect information that is related to you but that does not personally identify you (“Non-personal Information”). Non-personal Information includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified (for instance, by aggregating, anonymizing, or deidentifying such information) in order to remove or hide any Personal Information.
Technical Information
We may also collect Technical Information about visitors to our Site and users of our app, which is internet or other electronic network activity information such as the domain type, browser version, service provider, and device type (for mobile) used to access our Site or app. This “Technical Information” is information that does not, by itself, identify a specific individual but which could be used to indirectly identify you. Like many other commercial websites, our Site may employ a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how our Site is used and to remember visitors. This information also provides us information about the technical stability of our Site, app and Fridays Rewards™ program, as well as support our customer analytics efforts. When you visit our Site, our Servers send a cookie to your computer or mobile device to help personalize your experience and advertisements. Cookies recognize your web browser but information collected from cookies is not personally identifiable. Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. Although you are not required to accept cookies, if you block or reject them, certain features of our Site will be disabled and you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Site.
For those guests that access our in-store Wi-Fi, we will have access to such guests’ device ID and name, if available.
When you log in to our mobile application, you will be asked whether you want the mobile application to remember you. If you choose yes, the mobile application will remain logged in to your information. At any time you can choose to log out by choosing the logout button on the application.
Information Collected about Friends/Family
Fridays may also collect information about your friends and family through your interactions on our services. Referring friends to our services requires you to send their personal information to Fridays. Other instances, such as sharing content, may also require you to send their personal information to us.
Information Collected from Social Media Applications/Networking Websites
Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and other widgets that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the organization providing it.
Information Collected from Other Sources
Fridays may also collect information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, and prevent or detect fraud. We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, subcontractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, fraud protection services) and may receive information about you from them. The following are some examples:
Third-Party Vendors: In order to provide services and improve Fridays’ websites, we may engage the services of third-party vendors. In the process of supplying services to Fridays, these third-party vendors may need to collect Personal Information about you.
Co-branding: Some company websites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you use such websites or services, both Fridays and the other company may receive the Personal Information that Fridays collected via that co-branded website or service.
Public Forums, Blogs and the Customer Reference Program: Fridays’ websites may feature bulletin boards, blogs or forums. Any Personal Information that you  choose to submit via such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who  visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages.
Flash LSOs: We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to store content information and preferences. We partner with third parties to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your  browsing activity. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
Log Files: Log files record website activity on our services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Fridays determine (among other things) how many and how often users have accessed or used our services, which pages they've visited, and other similar data.
Clear GIFs: Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.

Security Measures to Protect Your Personal Information
Security of all information is of the utmost importance for Fridays. Fridays uses technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorized disclosure. We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems to keep all information secure. We also make all attempts to ensure that only necessary people and third parties have access to personal information. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a customer’s credit card number, is encrypted prior to transmission. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse, or alteration of personal information and we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the case of a data breach, we will notify you without delay of any loss, misuse or alteration of personal information that may affect you. We will notify relevant regulatory bodies within 72 hours of a breach.
Fridays retains your information for business purposes, for as long as your account is active, and/or for as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services. Fridays will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time. At any point in time, you can withdraw consent and we will immediately stop processing your data.
Information We Distribute or Make Accessible to Third Parties
We will not provide access to your information other than as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not rent, sell or share information about you other than as described in this Privacy Policy. The information that you provide is collected by Fridays. In the case of links to our gift card site or other sites, the information you voluntarily provide at those sites will only be shared with those service providers who help Fridays administer those websites or mobile application and the services they provide. In any case, these service providers may use the information only for the purpose of administering the digital or mobile application and its services for Fridays, and are contractually required to protect the information and to comply with the obligations of the GDPR and CCPA.

We share information including name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact data (including email address, telephone number, and physical address), and online identifiers like social media handles, if provided. These third parties only have access to personal information necessary for them to complete their service. We require that our third-party service providers and channel partners agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements we have in place with them. These third-party service providers and channel partners are expected to maintain privacy and security protections that are consistent with Fridays’ privacy and information security policies. We may develop and share summary reports for our advertising partners and agencies that contain non-personal aggregate raw numbers or statistics (which means such information will not tell them who it was that stated a preference or clicked an option).
We may be required to disclose personal information to governmental authorities, law enforcement agencies, government agencies or legal entities. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, we will provide this information upon receipt of and in accordance with appropriate documentation.
