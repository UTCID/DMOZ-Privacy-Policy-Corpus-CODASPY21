You should carefully read a Fund's offering materials and related information for specific risk and other important information regarding an investment in that Fund before investing. The Site does not list, and does not purport to list, the risk factors associated with an investment in any of the Funds listed on the Site.

By accessing the password-protected area of the Site, you agree not to invest in any posted Fund or alternative investment vehicle (other than Funds or alternative investment vehicles in which you or your affiliates are already invested, have already been solicited for or are already actively considering an investment in) for thirty (30) days after the approval of your application and confirmation of your status as a qualified client. The managing members of HedgeCo who are registered representatives with an affiliate registered FINRA broker/dealer, may have a marketing relationship and/or an economic interest in the general partner and/or investment manager of one or more posted Funds on the Site. If such a relationship exists, it will be explained through an interstitial that will appear before any User is provided access to that Fund's information.

For individuals such changes may include, for example, a registered User's net worth (either solely or jointly with his or her spouse) declining below $1,000,000 in the case of "accredited investors," (or $1,500,000 for "qualified clients"), or an expectation that income for the next twelve months may total less than $200,000, or an expectation that the registered User's combined income with his or her spouse may total less than $300,000 in the next twelve months. All registered Users, including individuals and entities, should communicate with their legal advisors if they believe that their investor status has changed.
4. You acknowledge and agree that Funds: (i) often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss; (ii) can be highly illiquid; (iii) are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors; (iv) may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information; (v) are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds; and (vi) often charge high fees.

One or more qualified HedgeCo affiliates may receive compensation from certain Premium Hedge Funds for investments made in such Funds by registered Users of the Site or by other investors.
