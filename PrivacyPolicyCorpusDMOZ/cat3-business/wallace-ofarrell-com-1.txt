We ship domestic via US Postal Service 1st class and Priority mail except for Shave Foam which will ship FedEx Ground. If you require FedEx or UPS service either because you are shipping to a commercial address or require expedited shipping, please call us during our business hours Monday-Thursday 7:30 AM – 4:00 PM and Fridays 7:30 AM – 3:30 PM Pacific time. Do not attempt to order internationally on our website. For international shipments contact customer service at 800-759-7883, 253-845-6633 or contact us here. We will reply with the cost of your order, including shipping. If you are satisfied with the cost, then you can give us your Visa or MasterCard information and your order will ship within one business day.
Shipping is an estimate: Your shipping charges are calculated at checkout on the weight of the product and your zip code.
For privacy reasons we ship in non-descript packaging. Once you place an order, it is usually shipped the next day and will normally take between three and eight business days to arrive.

What Our Customers Say
"I have recommended many products to women for vaginal dryness and have found Slippery Stuff to be an excellent product. Women have responded in an appreciative manner when I have offered them samples and they have returned expressing satisfaction with its use. ..The soothing characteristics of Slippery Stuff has helped patients through many rough periods. With the increased use of condoms for protection against disease, its also nice to know that it is compatible with condom usage."Catherine R., Certified Sex Therapist / Pittsburgh, PA
