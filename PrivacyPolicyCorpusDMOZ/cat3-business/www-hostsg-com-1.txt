Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
When you register for a HostSG account or reseller program, HostSG
obtains contact information, such as your name, email and postal
address, and phone number, as well as payment information, such as your
credit card number. When you use HostSG's service, our systems record
information about your session, such as the dates and times of use, and
the specific Internet address assigned to you. To do this we may use
standard web server log files as well as session or persistent based
cookies. HostSG also tracks requests you make for information on
HostSG's products and services, and responses you provide to HostSG
surveys. Finally, HostSG keeps records of your payment history and
communications you have with HostSG's support team. Except in
extraordinary circumstances (when we receive a court order, to protect
the company's rights or property, or in emergencies where someone's
safety is at risk), HostSG does not keep track of what sites you visit
when you are using the service as an identifiable individual.
What Information Does HostSG Gather?
When you register for a HostSG account, HostSG obtains
contact information, such as your name, address, and phone number, as
well as payment information, such as your credit card number. When you
use HostSG's service, our systems record information about your session,
such as the dates and times of use, and the specific Internet address
assigned to you. HostSG also tracks requests you make for information on
HostSG's products and services, and responses you provide to HostSG
surveys. Finally, HostSG keeps records of your payment history and
communications you have with HostSG's support team. Except in
extraordinary circumstances (when we receive a court order, to protect
the company's rights or property, or in emergencies where someone's
safety is at risk), HostSG does not keep track of what sites you visit
when you are using the service.
What Does HostSG Do With This Information?
HostSG uses the information it gathers in order to
provide you with the best online experience possible. As you might
expect, contact information is used to contact you concerning your
account and our company. Payment information is used to validate your
identity and to bill you for the services and products you order.
Information on your online sessions is used to allocate system resources
and to ensure compliance with HostSG's Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Information on your communications with HostSG's support team is used
to address the issues raised by your communications. In addition, HostSG
regularly sends out mailings regarding the operation of its service and
other goods and services that it believes may be of interest to you.
You may request that HostSG not send you mailings relating to other
goods and services at the URLs listed in this section or send an e-mail
to support@HostSG.com. HostSG reserves the right, however, to send
bulletins and other important information regarding the service at its
discretion.
Does HostSG Share Subscriber Information With Third Parties?
HostSG will not share or disclose information regarding
its subscribers except (i) when we receive legal process such as a
court order or are required to disclose the information by law ; (ii)
when reasonably necessary to protect the company's rights or property;
(iii) in emergencies where someone's safety is at risk; (iv) or as
required for domain name registration (e.g.whoislookup).
You should be aware, however, that any information that
you disclose in a public space such as a bulletin board, or personal
Web site, HostSG's DNR domain registration is freely available to anyone
else visiting that space. HostSG cannot safeguard any personally
identifiable information you disclose in these locations, nor can it
ensure that information you voluntarily supply to third parties remains
private. Please review the privacy policies of third party sites you
frequent to ensure that your privacy preferences are respected.
Security
The security of your personal information is important
to us. When you enter sensitive information on our registration or order
forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology
(SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to
protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security
How Can I Correct or Update the Information?
You may correct that information by updating us with
your new information to support@HostSG.com. Please keep in mind that
under HostSG's Service Level Agreements (SLAs), subscribers are required
to provide HostSG with current contact and billing information. HostSG
may require a copy of a government issued form of identification before
disclosing billing information or before making changes to the billing
or contact information on an account.
What Happens to the Information if I Leave HostSG?
If you ever leave HostSG, HostSG will normally delete
your personally identifiable account information twelve months after the
account is cancelled, unless we are under a legal obligation to retain
it. We preserve account information for this short period of time in the
event you wish to reactivate your account and retain your previous
e-mail address. However, in the event of any accounting irregularities,
HostSG reserves the right to retain your contact and billing information
as necessary to resolve the matter.
Changes to This Policy and Questions About Privacy
HostSG reserves the right to make changes to this
policy. Minor changes will become effective immediately upon posting
them to this privacy statement. However, those changes that are material
will become effective 30 days after notice of them is posted here, on
the site or emailed or emailed with an appropriate effective time frame.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open a ticket at https://manage.hostsg.com/submitticket.php
