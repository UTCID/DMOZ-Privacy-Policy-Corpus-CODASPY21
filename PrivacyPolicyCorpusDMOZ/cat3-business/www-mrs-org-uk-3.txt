Protecting and promoting research in the UK and EU
We fight for fair and favourable legislation for both the practice and business of research. We engage with regulators, ministers and parliamentarians, to protect and promote the role of research as a force for democracy, commerce and society.
We work closely with MRS members and Company Partners, as well as with a range of other trade associations to ensure our representations are accurate, timely and effective. In Europe, we work with EFAMRO, the European Research Federation - the voice of the European sector - to engage with the European Union and the Council of Europe.
Data Protection
The Data Protection Act 1998 is the key piece of legislation underpinning the business of research. The Act is based on Directive 95/46/EC, which since 2009 has been the subject of review in the EU and the UK.
