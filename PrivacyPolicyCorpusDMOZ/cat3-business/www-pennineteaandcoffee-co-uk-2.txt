"Seller/Company" means Pennine Tea and Coffee Company . "Conditions" means the terms and conditions of trading set out in this document which shall govern to the exclusion of any other terms and conditions. An "Order" means an order given orally or in writing using an acceptable form of communication (Such as Telephone, Letter, Facsimile, Online) and in both cases given by an authorised representative of the buyer. Singular words include the plural and vice versa and masculine includes the feminine and vice versa. Any recommendation or advice given by the seller or its employees or agents is acted upon entirely at the buyers own risk and accordingly the seller shall not be liable therefore.
Distribution of goods
To ensure your order is delivered we require a full delivery address and postcode, along with a contact telephone number in case their are difficulties finding your address. No responsibility is accepted for late or non deliveries caused by incorrect address details or lack of telephone number. Goods ordered will be dispatched as soon as possible if the items are in stock, if any items are out of stock then the order will be delayed until all items are ready to ship. Any items that are not likely to be in stock for a long period of time will be removed from the order and the remainder sent, it is upto the customer to re-order these items. Delivery of goods is contracted out to a Third Party - we can not accept any responsibility for delays which occur while the goods are in the hands of third parties. Damaged or missing items should be marked on the consignment sheet when you sign for the goods - always check the number of boxes you receive against the number of boxes on the manifest before signing for the goods.
