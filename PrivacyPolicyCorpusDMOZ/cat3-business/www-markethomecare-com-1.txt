I. Information Collection

We collect various information from the website: click stream tracking (statistical data), automatic logging files (name of the browser and type of computer used, web page last visited before coming to this site, activity on this site, pages visited and data downloaded, date, time and duration of the visit, search engine keywords used to find this site, and/or the visitor’s IP address {a series of numbers representing either your computer’s network identification or that of your Internet access provider}).
corecubed does not actively market to children, and we will never knowingly ask a child under 18 to reveal any personal information about himself or herself. Though our website appeals to a general audience, we do not actively market to children, nor do we encourage anyone under the age of 18 to register with us. We will never knowingly correspond through email to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 18 without their parent’s consent. We advocate parents and guardians to participate in their children’s online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to oversee their child’s access to the web.

Out of respect for the privacy of our customers, we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
The information collected on our site may be used to create customer profiles based on browsing or purchasing history. We may supplement information collected at our website with data from other sources, such as credit history to authorize purchases.
We may share data with certain third parties including but not limited to credit card processing companies, digital download fulfillment services, and shipping companies. These third parties will use the information to be able to provide the services intended. In some cases, users may choose to opt out of having their information shared with third parties.
