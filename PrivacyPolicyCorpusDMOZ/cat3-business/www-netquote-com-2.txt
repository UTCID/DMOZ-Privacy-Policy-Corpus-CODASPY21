Our Services
The Website may offer various applications, widgets, email notifications and other services (collectively, the “Services”) that provide a venue through which you can obtain information and you can find third-party service providers, such as financial institutions, credit card providers, mortgage brokers, insurance brokers, insurance agents, discount program representatives and other insurance professionals (“Service Providers”).  We do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any Service Provider, and we are not an agent or advisor to you or any Service Provider.  We do not validate or investigate the licensing, certification or other requirements and qualifications of Service Providers.
The Services are broad in scope and do not consider your personal financial situation. Your personal financial situation is unique and the information on the Website may not be appropriate for your situation.  Accordingly, before making any financial decisions, we recommend that you obtain additional information and advice of your accountant and other financial advisors who are aware of your individual circumstances.
Requests for Quotes or Offers.  Our Services may give you the opportunity to request to be matched with and receive quotes or offers from Service Providers by providing your name and contact information, such as your email address and telephone number (a “Match Request”).  If you make a Match Request or otherwise provide your telephone number or email address on the Website, you expressly authorize Service Providers and All Web Leads and their agents and partner companies to contact you by telephone, fax and email at the telephone numbers and email addresses provided, for purposes of providing you with the quotes, products and services indicated in your Match Request, and for marketing purposes.  You agree that such communications may be sent to your mobile phone via automated telephone dialing system, prerecorded calls, text messages, SMS, MMS, and picture messages, even if the phone number is on a corporate, state or national Do Not Call list. Further, you agree to receive marketing emails even if you previously opted out of receiving marketing emails from All Web Leads or specific Service Providers.  You also consent to Service Providers and All Web Leads making automated or prerecorded calls or sending text messages to your mobile telephone number using automated technology concerning your Match Request, including but not limited to reminding you about deadlines or confirming your contact information. Your consent is not required to make a purchase.  Without limiting anything in the Privacy Policy, you authorize Service Providers, and their affiliates and third-party service providers, to conduct all necessary research with your information, including checking your credit history, if applicable, for purposes of providing you with your Match Request.
Service Providers. It is your sole responsibility to investigate Service Providers.  You acknowledge and agree that Service Providers are solely responsible for any services that they may provide to you and that we are not liable for any losses, costs, damages or claims in connection with, arising from, or related to, your use of a Service Provider’s products or services.  You are solely responsible for your financial decisions, and we urge you to obtain the advice of financial advisors, insurance agents, brokers and other qualified professionals who are fully aware of your individual circumstances before you make any financial or insurance decisions.  You acknowledge and agree that you rely on your own judgment and that of such advisors in selecting any products or services offered by Service Providers.  Further, you acknowledge and agree that we are not a Service Provider, financial institution, insurance provider, or credit card provider. Our Services are limited to helping connect you with Service Providers.  We do not, and will not, make any coverage or credit decision with any Service Provider referred to you.  We do not issue mortgages, credit cards, insurance coverage or any other financial products. We do not make any warranties or representations regarding the quotes, fees, terms, rates, coverage or services offered or made available by Service Providers.  We do not guarantee that quotes, fees, terms, rates, coverage or services offered by Service Providers are the best available. In addition, we do not guarantee that you will be matched with a Service Provider.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE SOLELY AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN YOU AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS. YOU RELEASE US OF ANY AND ALL LOSSES, COSTS, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING FROM, OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF A SERVICE PROVIDER’S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES.  BY SUBMITTING A MATCH REQUEST, YOU AUTHORIZE AND AGREE THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR REQUEST.  FOR EXAMPLE, CONSUMER AND CREDIT REPORTS AND DRIVING RECORDS MAY BE ORDERED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR QUOTE REQUEST. THESE REPORTS MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY ASSIST SERVICE PROVIDERS IN DETERMINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR THEIR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND RATES THAT YOU MAY BE CHARGED. CONSUMER REPORTS MAY ALSO BE USED FOR UPDATES, RENEWALS, OR EXTENSIONS OF ANY INSURANCE YOU MAY OBTAIN. A PROVIDER MAY ALSO OBTAIN AND USE A CREDIT-BASED INSURANCE SCORE CONTAINED IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT. THIS INFORMATION MAY BE COMBINED BY A PROVIDER WITH INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US, AND BY SUBMITTING A MATCH REQUEST, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR WRITTEN PERMISSION TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN YOUR CREDIT REPORT.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to, or use of the Website, the Services, any other products or services offered through the Website, any telephone calls, emails, or text messages that you receive from Service Providers or otherwise related to this Agreement (“Disputes”), shall be resolved exclusively through confidential arbitration, rather than in court, and shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.   The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Further, any question as to the validity of this Arbitration Agreement shall be submitted to confidential arbitration and decided by an arbitrator.  For the avoidance of doubt, all claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and state telemarketing and email marketing laws shall be considered “Disputes” that are subject to resolution by binding individual, confidential arbitration.
If a Dispute arises under this Agreement, you agree to first contact us at:  legal@allwebleads.com. Before formally submitting a Dispute to arbitration, you and we may choose to informally resolve the Dispute.  If any Dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree that any and all Disputes, including the validity of this arbitration clause and class action waiver, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in a location convenient to you or telephonically.  Either you or we may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party.  We will pay all of the filing costs.  The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.  The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at http://www.adr.org.  Except as may be required by law as determined by the arbitrator, no party or arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.  Without limiting the foregoing, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO ANY TEXT MESSAGES OR TELEPHONE CALLS YOU RECEIVE FROM OR ON BEHALF OF US OR ANY ENTITY  WITH WHOM WE MAY SHARE YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER (INCLUDING SERVICE PROVIDERS).  Further, we both agree that all entities with whom we share your telephone numbers, including Service Providers, shall be third party beneficiaries of this Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and that those entities have the same rights as All Web Leads to enforce this arbitration provision.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of Texas: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or contesting the validity of our or one of our family company’s intellectual property rights and proprietary rights, including without limitation, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, or trade secrets; (ii) an action by us for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief; (iii) any legal action by us against a non-consumer; and (iv) interactions with governmental and regulatory authorities.  You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through a class action, private attorney general proceeding, class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this arbitration agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this arbitration agreement shall still apply; however, if an arbitrator or court decides that the class action waiver is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration agreement shall be null and void.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.  You shall have thirty (30) days from the earliest of the date that you visit the Website or the date you submit information through the Website to opt out of this arbitration agreement, by contacting us by email at: legal@allwebleads.com or by mail at:  7300 FM 2222, Bldg. 2, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78730, Attention: Legal Department.
If you do not opt out by the earliest of the date that you visit the Website, or the date you submit information to us through the Website, then you are not eligible to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
Miscellaneous
If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Agreement. The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Agreement, and shall not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive your acceptance of this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement. This Agreement and the Privacy Policy represent the entire understanding and agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersede all other previous agreements, understandings and/or representations regarding the same.
