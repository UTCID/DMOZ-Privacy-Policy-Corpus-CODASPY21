Terms of Service
These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of any website, mobile or tablet application, including any online service or platform (collectively, the “Services”) of Chefette Restaurants Limited, or any of its companies or brands, including without limitation the CHEFETTE and the BARBECUE BARN (collectively, “CRL”, “we”, “us”), that provides an authorized link to the Services regardless of the restaurant you ultimately visit, as well as our interactions with you on third party platforms.
1. Binding Agreement
The Terms are a binding legal contract between you and CRL. Please read the Terms carefully before using the Services. Your use of the Services means that you agree to be bound by the Terms. Do not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.
We may modify the Terms at any time. Your use of the Services after we post modifications to the Terms means that you accept the modified Terms. You must be 13 years or older to use the Services.
2. Privacy

When you register or provide any other information in connection with the Services, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to promptly update this information to maintain its accuracy. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password and username that you are given or select, and you are responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.

You agree to immediately notify CRL of any unauthorized use of your password or username or any other breach of security.

8. Links and Third Party Content
The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are not under the control of CRL. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by CRL of those other websites or online services, the content they display, or people associated with them. The Terms do not apply to such other websites and online services, and such websites and online services are not part of the Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of these other websites or services.
We may incorporate third party services, software, technology, data, and/or other content, either independently or in connection with various programs, features, or functions available through the Services. Your use of third-party materials may be subject to terms of use other than these Terms and as may be set forth by third party providers, as applicable. You agree that CRL assumes no liability with respect to your use of such third-party materials, whether you are aware of their use or not and whether or not the use of such materials is recommended by CRL.
You may link to our Services provided that you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest or imply any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part where none exists. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.
9. Online Ordering and Online Payment
You may be permitted to participate in certain functionalities of the Services which allow you to use a device to order and pay for certain products from any CRL brand restaurant at or prior to arrival at the participating restaurant location (“Online Ordering”). CRL reserves the right at any time to discontinue Online Ordering or Online Payment, or to change the location of restaurants or markets offering or participating in Online Ordering or accepting Online Payment at any time.
For your protection, customers are limited to 2 orders within any hour and an order limit of BBD$400.00 a day. If you wish to place an order totalling more than BBD$400.00 you will need to obtain special permission ahead of placing the order. Please contact (246) 629-3378 or e-mail info@chefette.com to arrange to place large orders. New user accounts (accounts less than 30 days old) will be restricted to a limit of BBD$300.00.
All credit card transactions are processed using the services of a third-party provider. CRL does not collect nor store credit card information in any form on any of our servers.
All prices quoted on the Services are in Barbados dollars and all credit card transactions will be processed in Barbados Dollars unless otherwise noted.
10. Order fulfilment
Online orders are to be collected at the restaurant selected during the ordering process at the specified Pickup time. Online Orders (“the Orders”) are to be collected from the Pickup Counter inside the selected restaurant. An electronic receipt will be presented to you at the end of the online ordering process to the email address provided during registration for the Services.
On attending the selected restaurant, proceed directly to the Pickup Counter as opposed to the cashier and present the electronic receipt, either on a mobile device or in a printed form, to collect the Orders. Failure to present this receipt will result in your inability to collect the Orders.
An Online Order can be cancelled at any time before the cancellation timeframes specified on the electronic receipt. You must follow the instructions on the electronic receipt in order to cancel an Online Order.
The Orders are prepared in time for collection at the Pickup Time stipulated during the ordering process. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Orders are collected timely. CRL is not responsible for replacement of, nor will refunds be granted for, food which is deemed unsatisfactory due to late pickup on your part.
11. Refunds
It is your responsibility to inspect the Orders, including those including food items, collected at the time of Pickup, whether by you, your agent or otherwise, before leaving the restaurant. In the event that any portion of the Oders comprising food is deemed unsatisfactory at the time of collection, a replacement, or in some cases a refund, may be requested.  You will be required  to speak to a manager on duty at the selected restaurant. There will be no refund or replacement of any aspect of the Orders comprising food after it leaves our premises, after having been checked by you or your agent.
If a refund has to be made to your credit card do note that it may take up to 10 business days for the refund to be processed and may depend on your financial institution.  CRL bears no responsibility for any delays in processing refunds which are attributable to third parties inclsuive of your financial institution.
12. Termination
In our sole discretion, we may restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to and use of the Services, with or without prior notice. CRL is not responsible for any error relating to the Services or any other products offered via the Services.
Otherwise applicable sections of these Terms shall survive termination. CRL also reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Services, including any of the CRL Content.
13. Limitation of Liability
To the extent permitted by law, CRL’s liability in relation to any product or service purchased as a consequence of your use of the Services is limited to the lesser of: (a) the replacement of any product purchased; and (b) the purchase price paid by you to CRL’s for the product or service.
Under no circumstances, including without limitation negligence, will CRL, its affiliates, or any party involved in operating, creating, producing, or delivering the Services be liable for any damage or losses including without limitation direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, special, or punitive damages or lost profits arising out of the Terms or your access, use, misuse, or inability to use the Services, including without limitation any CRL content or User Content, or any sites linked from the Services, however caused, whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, even if CRL has been advised of the possibility of such damage, or in connection with any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, line or system failure, or other technologically harmful material that may infect your device, data, or other proprietary material due to your use of our Services or to your downloading of any content on it or on any website linked to it.  Further, CRL will not be liable for the accuracy of the information on the website and holds out no warranties or representations that the information on the website or the Services is current in real time. Any errors on the website or the Services will be corrected when discovered and CRL reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any error, inaccuracy, or omission (including after an Online Order has been submitted).
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable to you for any loss or damage (whether direct, indirect or consequential) howsoever caused, nor will we be in default under these Terms, for failure to observe or perform any of our obligations under these Terms for any reason or cause except if caused by CRL’S gross negligence. If a jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability in accordance with this paragraph but allows a limitation of a certain maximum extent then our liability is limited to that extent.
14. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend CRL, its affiliates and licensors, any party involved in operating, creating, producing, or delivering the Services, and each of their respective officers, owners, directors, shareholders, contractors, agents, employees, general and limited partners, successors, and assigns from and against any and all demands, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, interest, penalties, losses, costs, expenses, and harms, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and fees of other professional advisers, arising out of or in connection with (i) your use of the Services, (ii) your online conduct in connection with the Services, (iii) your (or anyone acting under your password or username) violation or breach of these Terms, (iv) your failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations in connection with the Services, (v) your negligence, wilful misconduct, or violations of the intellectual property or other rights of any person in connection with the Services, or (vi) any of your dealings or transactions with other persons, persons or third party platforms resulting from use of the Services. You shall not settle any such claim without the prior written consent of CRL. These obligations will survive any termination of these Terms.
15. Integration, Severability and Waiver
These Terms and all other legal notices, statements or terms and conditions posted or made available to you on the Services constitute the entire agreement between CRL and you. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision. Our failure to enforce any provisions of the Terms or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive our right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect to similar breaches.
