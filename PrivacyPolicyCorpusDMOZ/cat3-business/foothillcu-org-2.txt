Cookies on Website
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by the websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work and to provide information to the owner of the website.
Why do we use cookies?
When someone visits www.foothillcu.org we collect standard internet log information so that we can track visitor behavior patterns. We do this to find out things like how many people have visited a particular page or how long visitors spend in different parts of the site. This helps us to improve our website and to plan our future work.
We also use cookies to make certain parts of the website work, for instance in order to submit a research project or to use some features, like MyClippings, when we need to know who you are. You can delete existing cookies and block new ones from our website – there is more information on this below – but this will mean that parts of the site will not work for you.
How can I delete and block cookies?
Most modern web browsers give you some control over cookies. You can set your web browser to accept or reject all cookies or to accept or reject specific cookies. You may also be able to set your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered.
You can find out how to control and delete cookies on AboutCookies.org
Links
We are not responsible for practices employed by websites linked to or from our site, nor the information, content, accuracy, or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us, nor do we maintain any editorial or other control over such websites. Inclusion of any linked website on our site does not imply approval or endorsement of the linked website by us. This remains true even where the linked site appears within the parameters or window/frame of our site. Often, links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to users of our site. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.

Security
Encryption
All Foothill@Home Internet transactions and account data are protected by 128-bit encryption technology, the highest level of encryption in use with online banking today. Additionally, your access code (or PIN) ensures only you have access to your accounts.
Online Banking
If you visit our secure Online Banking site, you will be required to provide multifactor authentication (answer one of several secure questions) in addition to a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is your unique password to enter and use our secure Online Banking server. This information is never given, sold or disclosed to third parties. It is held in strict confidence. When using Online Banking, certain online information, including the transactions you conduct, are recorded. This allows the Foothill Credit Union staff to confirm your transactions. The Credit Union stores no member or account information on our web server, which is accessed by the public. All member account information is housed on computers that are behind firewalls (protected area). All on-line transactions are authenticated and encrypted with the highest level of security protection available.
Your Foothill Credit Union information is password-protected. Foothill Credit Union uses industry-standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions. Emails that you may send without logging in to Foothill Credit Union may not be secure. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.
We provide a number of additional security features at Foothill Credit Union. After logging in, your online "session" will "timeout" after 10 minutes of inactivity and you will be automatically logged off. Inactivity does not include movement of the mouse. This prevents other individuals from accessing your personal information in case you have left your PC unattended without logging out. When you submit your password, it is compared with the password we have stored in our secure database. We allow you to enter your password incorrectly three times. If you enter your password incorrectly more than three times, your access to Foothill Credit Union will be locked until you contact us to reactivate the account. We monitor and record "bad login" attempts to detect any suspicious activity, such as someone trying to guess your password.
Just Starting
If you don’t already have an access code for using Foothill@Home (our Internet access service) please call a Call Center representative at 626-445-0950. We will mail an access code to you. After receiving your initial access code, you may change your code at any time. Your Foothill@Home access code can be from 6 to 10 characters long.
Limited Log-In Attempts
We allow you to enter your password incorrectly five (5) times. After the third incorrect entry, your on-line account will be locked until you call our Call Center at 626-445-0950. We monitor and record log-in attempts to detect any suspicious activity (i.e. someone trying to guess your access code).
Keep Your Access Code Confidential
You play a crucial role in preventing others from logging on to your account. Never use codes that are easy to guess. Examples of bad access codes are: birthdays, first names, pet names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, etc. Never reveal your access code to another person. You should periodically change your access code in the "Other Options" screen in Foothill@Home. Do not share confidential information with anyone, including family or friends. If you need someone to access your accounts, consider making them an authorized signer.
Secure Firewall
Foothill Credit Union uses a state-of-the-art firewall system to protect our internal networks from outside intrusion. The firewall refuses connections that are not authorized and only allows certain protocols into the internal computer system.
Browsers
It is recommended that you use the latest versions of either Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer. The browser level is important. You must have version 3.0 or higher of Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Your browser must be SSL 3.0 (Secure Socket Layer 3.0) compatible. Version 3.0 or higher of Netscape and Internet Explorer satisfy the SSL requirement.
Your browser must be configured to always accept cookies for the SSL security feature to work. The default configuration for all browsers is to accept cookies.
Cookies on Home Banking
Cookies are simply text file data written to your hard drive by the browser, which tracks information about a home banking session. Cookies are not destructives or malicious in nature because all the data within the cookies is encrypted twice. They simply store information useful to our server that makes your experience much easier.
When you complete your home banking session, by using the END SESSION link, the cookies will automatically be removed from your hard drive. If your Foothill@Home session is ended any other way, the cookies are left on your hard drive, but will expire so that the information can not be used in a malicious manner. The next time you log into the site, the cookies from the previous session are immediately deleted, and replaced by new cookies from the current session.
Online Precautions
Keep your anti-virus and anti-spam software up to date. Have it scan your computer nightly.
Enable the firewall on your computer. Internet Service Providers also provide firewall protection.
Download security patches from your computer’s operating system vendor.
Instruct your children to be careful online.
Try not use public accessible computers to access your credit union account. Computers accessible to the public may be infected with viruses or tracking programs.
