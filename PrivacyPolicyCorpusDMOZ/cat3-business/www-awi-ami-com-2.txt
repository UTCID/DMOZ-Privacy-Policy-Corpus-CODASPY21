Violation of Copyrights. If you are requesting removal of Content because of a violation of your copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that your own work, or the work of a third party for whom you are authorized to act, is featured on any of our Sites or has been otherwise copied or made available on our Sites in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, please send us a notice of the alleged infringement including all of the following information:
an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on this Site (including the URL, title and/or item number if applicable, or other identifying characteristics);
your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, and, if you are not the owner of the copyright, the name of the owner;

a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.

Severability and Non-Waiver
Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms and Conditions will not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision, and a waiver by us of any right under these Terms and Conditions on any occasion will not in any way constitute a waiver of such right or any other right on any other occasion. In the event any provision of these Terms and Conditions is determined to be invalid, such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining portions of these Terms and Conditions, and the parties will substitute for the invalid provision a provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. These Terms and Conditions will apply in lieu of and notwithstanding any specific legend or statement associated with any particular document or information exchanged.

You hereby consent and waive all objection to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and venue therein to resolve any controversy or claim of whatever nature arising out of or relating to use of our Sites.
