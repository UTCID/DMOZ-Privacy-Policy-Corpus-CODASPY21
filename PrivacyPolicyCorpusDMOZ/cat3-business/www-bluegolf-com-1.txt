incurred by you in connection with your chosen service and
registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that
in most cases, BlueGolf or Customer, as the case may be, will be
charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment
schedule of the service for which you have registered, but some
service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they
are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and
agree that it is your responsibility to notify BlueGolf and Customer
of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired
otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or
interrupted. All fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars.

not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or
a Service for which BlueGolf does not currently charge a fee) or
billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such
modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days
after BlueGolf posts such modification on the applicable BlueGolf
Site(s).
You may cancel your Account or any associated optional or
upgraded services therefore at any time, but BlueGolf will not refund
any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an
additional cancellation fee.
You agree to pay your Account balance on time. You also agree to pay
any taxes, including sales or use taxes, resulting from your use of
the Service.
You are responsible and liable for any fees, including
attorney and collection fees, that BlueGolf and/or Customer, as the
case may be, may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining
balances due from you. This section titled Charges and Billing For
Certain BlueGolf Sites shall in no way limit any other remedies
available to BlueGolf and Customer. You also understand and agree
that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if
you cancel your account or your account is terminated. You must
notify BlueGolf of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty
(60) days after they first appear on your statement. If you do not
notify BlueGolf within sixty (60) days, you waive any right to
dispute such problems or discrepancies.
