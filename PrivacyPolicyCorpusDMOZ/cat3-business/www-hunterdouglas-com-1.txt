Light Control & Privacy
From blocking out the sun to enhancing the natural light in your home
Silhouette® Window Shadings
Diffuse or Black Out Sunlight
Our products are designed to offer a range of light control and privacy options with a broad selection of fabrics and materials, in a range of opacities from sheer to room darkening to opaque.
The translucent fabrics that many of our products offer are specially engineered to diffuse harsh sunlight and draw it deeper into the room—dispersing the light to help illuminate your home naturally and reduce the need for artificial light. Our semi-opaque and opaque fabrics and materials are more appropriate for room darkening when you want as little light as possible. Learn more about our Window Treatments for Room Darkening & Blackout
Duette® Honeycomb Shades
Duette® LightLock™ System
Offering unparalleled darkness, LightLock™ is the newest operating system for Duette Honeycomb Shades that is the first of its kind to block light with patent-pending, U-shaped side channels that fits seamlessly into the window overlapping the front and back of the shades. The specially shaped micro-ridges inside the channels absorb light, preventing it from entering your room.
Provenance® Woven Wood Shades
Room Darkening Liners
If you are looking for optional room darkening capabilities, consider a room darkening liner available on many of our shades. The liner can be sewn directly to the face fabric, or for ultimate flexibility, can operate independently. Learn more about Provenance® Woven Wood Shades
Duette® Honeycomb Shades
Duolite®
Our Duolite feature offers maximum light control by using two separate fabric panels to achieve a 'day/night' level of convenience, providing limitless options for privacy and light control.
Duette® Honeycomb Shades
Top-Down/Bottom-Up
With innovations like our unique Top-Down/Bottom-Up operating system, you can maintain your privacy and still enjoy the natural light.
Pirouette® Window Shadings
Deflect or Redirect Sunlight
Select Hunter Douglas products feature innovative slats and vanes that allow you to deflect and redirect sunlight precisely where you want. Explore our Sheers & Shadings
