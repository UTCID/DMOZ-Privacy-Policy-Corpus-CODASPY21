Overview
GAO issues decisions regarding federal bid protests, appropriations law, and other legal matters.
Bid Protests
A bid protest is
a challenge to the terms of a solicitation or the award of a federal contract.
GAO adjudicates and decides these challenges.
Appropriations Law
GAO issues legal opinions and decisions to Congress and federal agencies on the use of,
and accountability for, public funds,
including ruling on potential violations of the Antideficiency Act.
Other Legal Work
We also conduct other legal work—such as reviewing how federal agencies comply
with the Congressional Review Act and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.
Check out our video highlighting GAO's Office of General Counsel—including its work on bid protests and appropriations law.
GAO's attorneys describe the legal services they provide to support GAO’s mission.
