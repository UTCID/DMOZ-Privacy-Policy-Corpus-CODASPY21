With whom we share personal information
From time to time, we may disclose personal information to third parties, as follows:
Business Partners - We may team up with other companies ("business partners") to offer certain promotions, jointly sponsor and promote such promotions, and develop subsites or separate websites that are used for a promotion. If you decide to participate in one of these promotions, the personal information that is collected from the relevant subsite will be collected by both Decathlon and the business partner(s) participating in the promotion. We will use that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and our business partner will use it in accordance with its own privacy policy. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of our business partners.
Service Providers - We may engage certain third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, storage, database management, credit card processing, shipping, fraud prevention, business analytics, chat, website analytics, website optimization, lead scoring, retargeting, direct marketing campaign and the sending of newsletters, or similar services.
We will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your personal information.
To Defend or Enforce our Rights - We may use or share personal information to protect Decathlon or protect the Website, to establish or exercise our legal rights, respond to a breach of our Website Terms of Use, when we believe it is appropriate to protect the property and rights of Decathlon or a third party, the safety of our company, our customers or others, to investigate, prevent, take action against, or stop any fraudulent, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, in connection with our Website, or other products the Decathlon Website Terms of Use, or other agreements.
Business Transfers - If any or all of the assets of Decathlon are acquired by, or merged with those of another entity, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may disclose, share or transfer some or all of our users' personal information to or with this entity in preparation of the transaction, as part of the due diligence, or after the transaction has been consummated, so that the successor entity can continue providing our services to our users. If the recipient of the personal information has personal information practices that do not meet the substance of this Privacy Policy, you will be given the opportunity not to continue to use the Website.
Compliance with Laws and Third Party Requests - Decathlon cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.

Please note that we may not be able to notify you of a request for the disclosure of your information as described above, because doing so might be prohibited by law, or because doing so would jeopardize an investigation into illegal or fraudulent activity, or because we do not have your contact information.
Aggregate Information - We may prepare reports, market analysis, and trend analysis that are based on compilation of data that Decathlon has collected. These reports do not contain specific user information, but only aggregate information regarding a group of users. Data aggregation is a process in which data is gathered and expressed in a summary form for purposes such as statistical analysis, in order to obtain information about a particular group based on specific variables. This aggregated information is used for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.
Cookies and other technologies
We use cookies and other technologies as described below to gather information about the users of our Website, in order to know what information is or might be of interest to them. All personal information collected through cookies is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Cookies - Some cookies are managed by us, and others by our service providers, such as when we display advertisements on third parties websites. These cookies are used for a variety of purposes.

We use tags to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve Website performance. We also may allow our service providers to use tags to analyze visitor traffic and actions on our Website and to help us understand which pages are more attractive to Users, or which emails have been opened by recipients.
