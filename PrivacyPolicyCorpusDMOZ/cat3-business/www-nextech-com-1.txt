Navigational Information
4.1 Cookies
This website may use "cookies" to help personalize the online experience of visitors. A cookie is a text file that is placed on a visitor’s hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. These cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you comment on a page of this website, or register for a consultation, a cookie may be used to help us recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the website, the information you previously provided can be quickly and easily retrieved.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if that is your preference. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the website. Nextech may track the pages you visit within this website, in order to determine what portions of the website are the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Nextech website to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular product or service.
4.2 Log Files
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites, using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that may be automatically collected by us. This information can include: IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. This information is used to maintain quality of our website, products, and services, as well as to provide general statistics regarding use of the Nextech website. For certain purposes, we may link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information (if it has been voluntarily provided) such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
4.3 Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage this website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers' Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Opting Out and Unsubscribing” (Section 5.1).
4.4 Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies
The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as "Flash cookies." Nextech does not use Flash cookies.  Therefore, the use of these technologies is not covered by our privacy statement. Nextech does not have access or control over any third-party tracking technologies.
4.5 Third Party Tracking Technologies
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third-party tracking technologies
