Moneytree Privacy Policy
“Great customer service
and fast service.”
Roll T.
Las Vegas, NV
This Privacy Policy supplements Moneytree’s GLBA Privacy Notice, which you can review by clicking here. In the GLBA Privacy Notice we describe our privacy practices for non-public personal information we collect in the course of our business of providing financial products and services to our customers. This Privacy Policy supplements that GLBA Privacy Notice in connection with our sharing of such non-public personal information with law enforcement officials, investigators and other third parties to investigate fraud, and in accordance with applicable law or legal process request. This Privacy Policy also applies to all other information (meaning information other than non-public personal information as described in our separate GLBA Privacy Notice) Moneytree may collect about you when you visit our branches or use our website and other online products and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise communicate with us.
Last Updated: 11/1/2019
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by sending you a notification via email or otherwise).

We log information about your use of our websites, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies:
We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve our websites and your experience, see which areas and features of our websites are popular and count visits. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our websites or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
Note:
We do not respond to Do Not Track signals sent from web browsers and so web beacons will continue to be used even if you enable Do Not Track settings in your browser.

Social Sharing Features
Our websites may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Moneytree and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.
