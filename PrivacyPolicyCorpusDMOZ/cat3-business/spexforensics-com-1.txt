Welcome to the Web site of SPEX Forensics (the “Company”).  This Web site (the “Company Web Site” or the “Web Site”) provides general information to users and registered customers about the Company, the products offered by the Company (the “Products”) and its services. Where appropriate, the term the “Company” refers both to the Company and its affiliates.
These Terms of Use were last updated on June 19, 2018.
All users of the Company Web Site, including registered users, are subject to the following terms and conditions of use (these “Terms of Use”).
This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Web Site. All users of the Web Site are subject to this Agreement. You are only authorized to use the Web Site (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement. By using the Web Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, as amended from time to time, as well as the Company Privacy Policy, whether you are a “Guest” (which means that you simply browse the Web Site without registering) or you are a “Customer” with a registered account (which means that you have registered as a customer through the Web Site or otherwise). The term “User” refers to a Guest or a Customer.
The information presented on or through this Web Site is made available solely for general informational purposes and the Company does not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of this information. Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Web Site, any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk.
The Company may modify this Agreement from time to time without notice and any such modification shall be effective upon posting by the Company on the Web Site. The Company shall indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. You agree to be bound by any changes to this Agreement when you use the Web Site after any such modification is posted. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
The Company’s use of your personal information and your responsibilities in connection with protecting your privacy are described in the Company Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully as it contains important information regarding your legal rights and obligations. If you object to anything in this Agreement (as amended from time to time), including the Privacy Policy, or are dissatisfied with the Web Site or Services, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Web Site or the Services.

You will not provide inaccurate, misleading or false information to the Company, any Company service provider or any other User. If information provided to the Company, a supplier, a service provider, or another User, subsequently becomes inaccurate, misleading or false, you will promptly notify the Company of such change or make or post the appropriate changes yourself.
By submitting User Content to the Company or posting it to any area of the Web Site, including without limitation, message boards, profiles, forums, and contests, you automatically grant to the Company and its affiliates an irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, fully paid nonexclusive right (including moral rights) and worldwide license to use, copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, communicate to the public, perform, display, and distribute such User Content (in whole or in part) and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works (in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content) such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses thereof (through multiple tiers).
You also represent and warrant that you have the right to grant or that the holder of any rights, including moral rights in such content, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant, the license stated above. If you post User Content in any public area of the Web Site, you also permit any User to access, display, view, store and reproduce such User Content for personal use and any other use consistent with the use for which it was intended.

7. Monitoring and Enforcement. The Company acts as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of posted User Content and assumes no responsibility and has no obligation to screen or monitor User Content or any other User communications or information. However, the Company reserves the right to review and remove any posted User Content that, in its sole judgment, violates this Agreement, violates applicable laws, rules or regulations, is abusive, disruptive, offensive or illegal, or violates the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety of, the Company Users or is not consistent with the purpose of the Web Site or Services (including with respect to any material the Company has been notified, or has reason to believe, constitutes a copyright infringement). The Company also may expel Users and terminate all rights of Customers and prevent further access to the Web Site and Services for violating this Agreement or applicable laws, rules or regulations or acting in any manner that is abusive, disruptive, offensive or illegal, violates the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety of, the Company Users or is not consistent with the purpose of the Web Site or Services. The Company may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such User Content could create liability for the Company, damage the Company’s brand or public image, or cause the Company to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its suppliers.
The Company can neither review all material before it is posted on the Web Site or Services, nor ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, the Company assumes no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by third parties. The Company reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary to protect the personal safety of Users and the public; however, the Company has no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this Section 7 of this Agreement.
The Company does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of User Content or any other communications posted or transmitted by Users, suppliers or service providers or endorse any opinions expressed by Users, suppliers or service providers. You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by or information received from other Users or any suppliers or service providers will be at your own risk.
