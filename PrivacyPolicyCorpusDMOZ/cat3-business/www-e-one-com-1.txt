We use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, analyze site traffic and personalize content.  If you continue to use our website, you consent to our use of cookies.
Privacy Policy
REV Group, Inc. (“REV Group”), and its affiliates and subsidiaries appreciates your interest in our products and services. Your privacy is important to us, and we want you to feel comfortable viewing our website and providing information to us. This Privacy Statement describes how REV Group may collect and handle your Non-Personal Information and Personal Information in connection with your activities with REV Group, including those related to Internet services controlled by REV Group, including websites and FTP servers. You should read this Privacy Statement before using this website and before engaging REV Group for products or services.
We reserve the right to revise this privacy statement, so we encourage you to review it periodically.
Collection and Use of Information
REV Group collects two types of information about our users: Non-Personal Information and Personal Information.
Non-Personal Information is the anonymous information that is automatically collected when you use any of REV Group’s Internet services. Non-Personal Information includes, but is not limited to: IP (Internet Protocol) address; server IP address; server port; domain used to access a REV Group Internet service; referring domain or website; type and version of operating system and web browser; search query (keywords entered into a search engine); the date and time the access occurred; which resources were accessed. Non-Personal Information is used in aggregate form in order to track and improve the efficiency of REV Group Internet services. REV Group may also use Non-Personal Information as part of an investigation of any suspected data event.
Personal Information means any information about an identifiable individual, and may include, but is not limited to: (i) your name, address, phone number, fax number, or email address; and (ii) credit and/or billing information. Personal Information is collected by REV Group when you voluntarily give it to REV Group. We may also receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such parties confirm to us that you have consented to the disclosure to REV Group of your Personal Information.
REV Group collects and uses Personal Information to provide you with the products and/or services you have requested from us and to contact you in order to provide you with product-related information, including: news; training and support; customized services; product documentation; and promotional materials. You may at any time withdraw your consent to any further collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information by giving us reasonable notice.
Confidentiality
Any personal information you may choose to share with us may be used for marketing research or other marketing and service-related purposes, such as updates and customer satisfaction. This information will not be disclosed to anyone outside of our company (including its respective subsidiaries and affiliates), subsidiaries, affiliates, authorized resellers, business partners, component manufacturers or licensed dealers, unless required by law. We do not exchange or sell your personal information to any other company.
On May 25, 2018, the European Union implemented new privacy regulations, known as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). REV Group’s corporate Privacy Policy addresses GDPR. If you have any concerns or questions related to your data or REV Group compliance with GDPR, you should contact the REV Group Data Privacy Officer (DPO) at privacy@revgroup.com.
Data Security
REV Group shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. REV Group has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Data Integrity
REV Group shall only use Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, REV Group shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
Access
REV Group shall allow an individual access to their Personal Information and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate Personal Information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated, or as otherwise prohibited by law.
Dispute Resolution
REV Group shall investigate questions and complaints about our information collection practices outlined and is committed to resolve any privacy concerns that individuals may have regarding this policy. REV Group has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) to resolve disputes pursuant to the Principles. A resident of the European Union (EU) whose inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed may contact either the EU DPAs panel at ec-dppanel-secr@ec.europa.eu or individual EU DPAs using the information provided at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/eu/index_en.htm.
Required Disclosure
REV Group may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requests.
Onward Transfers
REV Group acknowledges that it is liable for onward transfers to third parties.
