Privacy Policy
At Source Naturals, Inc., we’re committed to protecting your online privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect on SourceNaturals.com (including our social media feeds, mobile versions, and any of our related subsites, collectively referred to as the “Site”), how we use the information, whether we share the information with anyone else and if so with whom, and the rights of users of the Site regarding our use of the information, including how users may contact us about this policy.
As our services evolve, we may need to change the ways we use, protect, or share your personal information, and we may therefore from time to time amend this Privacy Policy.  The effective date appears at the end of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check our Site frequently to review the Privacy Policy in effect and any changes that may have been made to it.
Information That We Collect
You’re free to explore our Site without providing any personal information about yourself. But in some circumstances, we may request, and you may submit, personal information.
We collect personal information that you provide when you accept an offer: subscribe to our email newsletter; enter contests, sweepstakes, or promotions; respond to surveys or polls, or engage in other activities; post or send us direct messages through our social media feeds; send us email messages through our Contact Us page; or contact our Customer Service Team by phone or email.
By accepting an offer or visiting our Site, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of this data.
We don’t collect personal information about our users’ online activities over time or across third-party websites. Like many websites, our Site doesn’t currently respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. But with most internet browsers, you can take steps to limit tracking; see Cookies on Our Site below for more information about blocking cookies.
Cookies on Our Site
When you use our Site, in addition to information that you may provide, we may collect information by automated means, such as through using technologies like cookies, web server logs, beacons, and JavaScript. A “cookie” is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a site, the cookie is stored on your hard drive in a file specifically designated for cookies.
Like many other sites, we use cookies to obtain certain types of information when you access our Site, our ads, or other content provided by us or by others on our behalf from other sites. Information we gather through cookies may include the date and time of your visits to our Site, the pages viewed, and the time spent at our Site.
We use cookies to:
Personalize your experience;
Collect aggregate information about Site usage by all of our users;
Control the display of ads;
Offer other products, services, and functionalities personalized to you; and
Improve the performance of our Site to provide you with a better user experience.
By continuing to use our Site, you consent to our use of cookies as described. If you don’t consent to our use of cookies, then you may block them through the preferences or user settings in your browser.
In order to use certain services offered on our Site, your browser must accept cookies. If you choose to block our use of cookies, some aspects of our Site may not work properly, you may not be able to access all or part of our Site, and you may not be able to use all of the features available.
For more on cookies and similar technologies, and the browser settings that control them, please visit All About Cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org.
How We Use Your Information
The information we collect from you may be used in one or more of the following ways:
To provide a high level of customer service
To respond to your requests as efficiently and effectively as we can.

How We Protect Your Information
We use a variety of physical, administrative, and technical security measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These security measures may include firewall and security technology to maintain the integrity of the Site, password-protected directories and databases to safely store your information, or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and secure when sent across the internet.
While our security measures meet or exceed industry standards, no data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Our top priority is to maintain the safety of your personal information, but we can’t guarantee the absolute security of any information you submit to our Site.
Disclosing Personal Information to Third Parties
We don’t sell, rent, or share any personally identifiable information about our visitors with any third party for advertising, marketing, or data analysis purposes.

You request or authorize it;
The information is provided to help complete a transaction for you;
The information is provided to comply with the law, applicable regulations, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property, or safety or the rights, property, or safety of you or others;
The disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (for example, if another party acquires substantially all of our assets, personal information relating to customers, suppliers, and vendors may be one of the transferred assets);
The information is provided to our agents, outside vendors, or service providers to perform functions on our behalf (such as analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, processing orders, etc.); or,
We believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual espionage, cybersecurity events, or other fraudulent or illegal activity.
Keeping Personal Information
How long we keep information that we collect about you depends on the type of information. We retain aggregate information generated by cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date that such information was created.
We retain personal information that you provide to us where we have an ongoing, legitimate business need to do so (for example, as long as you’re subscribed to our services, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes).
If you’ve subscribed to our emails, entered a contest or sweepstakes, participated in a social media initiative, or responded to a promotional offer, we retain the information you provided for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our content, products, or services (such as when you last opened an email from us).
When we have no ongoing need to retain personal information, we securely delete or anonymize it. We will delete your information sooner if you so request by contacting us as described in “How to Contact Us and Opt Out” below.
