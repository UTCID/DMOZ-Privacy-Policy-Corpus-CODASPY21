The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely
to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance
results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particularly trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical
performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not
involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as
maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results. Currency trading involves
high risk and you can lose a lot of money.All Trade Copier Signals generated to the client account are manageable and can be overridden by the subscriber in the client account.
