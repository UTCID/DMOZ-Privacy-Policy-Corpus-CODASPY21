The Websites may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group (collectively, "Communication Services"). The Communication Services are considered part of the Websites. You agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send, and receive messages and material that are proper and related to the Communication Services. The Communication Services cannot be used to conduct commercial activities, including, but not limited to, transactions, advertising, fundraising, contests, or other promotions, absent our prior written consent.

FGX reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in FGX’ sole discretion.
Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children to or through a Communication Service. FGX does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Service and, therefore, FGX specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service.

FGX is under no obligation to pay for or respond to Submissions. You hereby grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to FGX an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, and prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use, your Submissions, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing, solely for the purposes of including your Submissions in the Websites.

You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of FGX. FGX will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
If you are a California resident or resident of a state with a similar applicable law, you hereby expressly waive California Civil Code section 1542 in connection with the foregoing (or such other similar applicable law in your state), which states: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
Termination/Access Restriction
FGX may reject your use of the Websites at any time and for any reason in FGX’s sole discretion.
Disputes with FGX and Agreement to Arbitrate
You and FGX agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section. Please read this Section carefully. It affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.
If a dispute arises between you and FGX, we want to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Please contact us regarding disputes between you and FGX related to the Websites, including, without limitation, FGX’s products and services.
You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and FGX, except as otherwise stated in these Terms. You understand that the Websites are directed only to residents of the United States and Canada.
You and FGX each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and FGX, EXCEPT FOR A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, FGX'S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSORS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, shall be resolved exclusively through confidential, final and binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
YOU AND FGX AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND FGX AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER FGX CUSTOMERS OR WEBSITE USERS.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Section. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at http://www.adr.org.
The arbitration shall be held in Providence County, Rhode Island or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or FGX may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and FGX subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and FGX, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be confidential, final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
With the exception of any of the provisions in these Terms relating to the prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief"), if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in this Section (particularly the prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief) is invalid or unenforceable, then with respect to actions that would have been covered by such provision, the entirety of this Section shall be null and void. The remainder of these Terms, including all other provisions of this Section, will continue to apply.
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and FGX agree that if FGX makes any change to this Section (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against FGX prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Section, any such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of the Terms containing this Section is posted to the Websites, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against FGX prior to the effective date of termination.
Claims and Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year.
To the extent permitted by law, and without limiting the effect of any disclaimer contained herein, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to your use of the Websites, including, without limitation, any Website related product, services, or other content must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. This section applies to you and your heirs, successors and assigns.
Severability
If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect.
Entire Agreement & Assignment
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and FGX with respect to the Websites and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and FGX with respect to the Websites. A printed version of these Terms and any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. FGX may also freely assign its rights and obligations under these Terms.
