HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We use industry standard security techniques on our Site to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the Personal Information we collect. Personal Information we collect is stored on servers we have attempted to secure from unauthorized access or intrusion by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software.
To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from “http” to “https.”
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't allow communication through secure servers. In that case, you won’t be able to connect to our server and therefore won’t be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by telephone at (800) 284-3958.
No transmission of data over the Internet or by mobile is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, neither Melissa & Doug nor any of our service providers can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.
Melissa & Doug does not ask you to provide Personal Information by sending e-mail requests. Therefore, if you receive an e-mail that looks like it comes from Melissa & Doug and asks you for Personal Information (such as your name, address, or credit card number), do not respond. The e-mail may be phishing to steal your Personal Information.
WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES?
You may receive e-mails, text messages, or other communications from us or our marketing partners with information about our products, services, offers and promotions, news, and tips. You can opt out of receiving these messages in the following ways:
• By following the “unsubscribe” link contained in the e-mails you receive.
• By replying STOP to any text message you receive, or texting STOP to 12534.
• By contacting us by e-mail at Service@MelissaAndDoug.com or by telephone at 1-800-284-3948.
If you opt out of receiving e-mails or text messages from us, we still may retain your Personal Information for recordkeeping and internal research and analysis.
You can disable cookies on your web browser by referring to the HELP menu option on the toolbar for most browsers. If you reject or disable cookies, you still may see ads or receive communications from us, although but they will not be based on your interests.
