Our
Privacy Policy
We do not collect any information that is not freely and knowingly
provided by you when and if you fill in any of our forms.
And when and if you do fill in any of our forms, to the extent permitted by law, your information is kept private
and confidential and is NOT, and will NEVER be,
sold nor distributed in any way.
This means that your information stays private,
period.
I am an Internet consumer myself and spam/uce really bugs me.
The worst is when I get an email that states "You are receiving
this email because you subscribed to ... " when I know
I did NOT subscribe. errgghh!
I used to list my home number here for folks to call me but due
to our
son's severe health problems I can no longer do that. So please
email me if
you'd like to chat about it.
Per California Spam Laws I have to state the date that our privacy
policy goes/went into effect. Our privacy policy went into effect
January 2000 when we first started our site. :)
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our visitors based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet.

We recognize that your privacy is important. This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use Download-Construction-Forms.com and TheContractorsGroup.com and store.Construction-Business-Forms.com, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information.
