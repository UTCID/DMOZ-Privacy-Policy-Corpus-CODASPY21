Maintenance and Care
Our first product, the Navy Chair, was made in 1944 to withstand the toughest conditions. Today our products are still designed and built to last. Part of that is ensuring they can be cleaned to keep them looking good for a long time and to help maintain a healthy environment - at home or in public settings, such as hospitality, corporate or healthcare environments.
All our recycled plastic and hand brushed aluminum chairs and stools are bleach cleanable. Hydrogen peroxide-based cleaners may also be used, dilution level 1:10. Please see detailed product specific info below.
Aluminum has anti-bacterial properties, making it a desirable material for sensitive settings such as healthcare environments, where it also performs exceptionally well from a maintenance standpoint.

Care + Maintenance for the 1006 Navy Collection
All Emeco Navy chairs and stools are made by hand. Each piece is unique with subtle differences.
Brushed Finish
Anodizing changes the aluminum surface to aluminum oxide, a super-strong material.
Anodized aluminum is corrosion-proof and can be used outdoors, however we suggest cleaning with soap and water every two weeks to remove grit and other air pollutants that can pit the surface.
Emeco Navy chairs and stools with brushed finish are bleach cleanable. Hydrogen peroxide based cleaners (dilution level 1:10) may also be used.
Daily Cleaning
To keep your chairs looking beautiful, clean with soap and water, and dry with a soft cloth. You can also use Windex®, Formula 409® or similar spray cleaner, with or without bleach followed by a lint free towel. Hydrogen peroxide-based cleaners may also be used, dilution level 1:10. Wash any film or residue with hot water. Do not use Stainless Steel cleaner on any aluminum furniture. For Heavy-duty dirt or oil use a very hot water and strong soap, followed by LIGHT scrubbing in the direction of the aluminum grain with a soft bristled brush or damp Scotchbrite® pad.
Scuffmarks
Light scrubbing in the direction of the aluminum grain with a Scotchbrite® pad.
Stains
Treat the stain with the appropriate cleaner (i.e. bleach for coffee, paint thinner for paint) leave the cleaner sit on the stain until the stain is dissolved, then follow the instructions for heavy duty dirt.
Polished Finish
It takes eight hours to hand polish each piece of Emeco furniture. Each item will exhibit slight variations of handcraft.
There is no coating on Emeco’s hand polished items and they will begin to patina immediately upon use. Polished aluminum is non-corrosive and does not tarnish. To keep your polished chairs shining brightly use an ordinary car wax.
Do not use abrasive cleansers, pads or brushes on hand polished aluminum.
Daily cleaning
Windex® or similar spray cleaner, with or without bleach followed by a soft, lint free towel. Wash any film or residue with hot water. Do not use Stainless Steel cleaner on any aluminum furniture.
Heavy-duty dirt or oil
We recommend Emeco Clean & Shine, which can be ordered from customerservice@emeco.net. Alternatively, use very hot water and strong soap, followed by a soft, lint free towel.
Light scratches
High quality aluminum polish with buffing pads in a circular pattern (available at most hardware stores). Follow by a light polish of cornstarch with a very soft cloth.

Selected initiatives supporting our policy:
Emeco’s products are manufactured in the US.
The Emeco factory in Hanover PA conforms to all applicable US, State and Local environmental requirements.
Emeco uses clear coat anodizing as the surface finishing method for most of our aluminum products. This not only significantly reduces particulate emissions, but also produces no volatile organic carbons (VOCs) in the application of the finish.
All welding machines have internal cooling systems to reduce water consumption by 15%
Advanced lighting technologies are installed throughout our manufacturing operations resulting in a 24% annual reduction in electrical consumption rate.
All aluminum used in Emeco products are at least 80% recycled and 100% recyclable.
Of the recycled aluminum, half is post consumer (soft drink cans) and half is postindustrial (manufacturing scrap). Chairs made out of virgin aluminum have an energy density that is 17 times higher than that of Emeco chairs. Use of recycled aluminum as oppose to virgin aluminum in production leads to 95% less energy consumption.
Emeco’s aluminum scrap generation-rate is approx. 6% annually by weight.
Emeco Manufacturing returns 100% of aluminum scrap to recyclers.
Emeco’s 111 Navy Chair contains at least 65% Recycled PET plastic.
100% of the PET used comes from a post consumer recycled source.
Emeco’s Recycled PET chairs are 100% recyclable.
Emeco uses sustainable timber and low-VOC finishes on our wood components.
Emeco’s Broom chair is made of 90% industrial waste content and is 100% recyclable.
The reclaimed wood polypropylene seats of Emeco’s Alfi and 1 Inch collections are made of 100% industrial waste content and are 100% recyclable.
Emeco’s Su Collection uses a variety of reclaimed and recycled materials in components such as recycled PET, Green Concrete mixed with post-consumer glass, reclaimed wood and recycled aluminum.
Emeco has a chair-to-chair recycling program. The plastic and all-aluminum chairs can be returned to Emeco for recycling. Emeco will recycle and put the recycled material back in chair manufacturing of the same or similar model.
LEED Certification:
No product can be LEED Certified; certification is only granted to the entire building or interior. A project is LEED Certified by qualifying for credits that accrue when environmentally sound choices are made in the design and building process. Product choices can help the project qualify for LEED Certification by being environmentally sound. Some jurisdictions require new construction to have a minimum number of LEED Credits.
Specifying Emeco furniture contributes to credit #2.1, Construction Waste Management because Emeco uses 100% recyclable shipping and packing materials.
Specifying Emeco furniture contributes to credit #4.2, Recycled Content. Emeco uses recycled material as far as possible in the creation of our products. All Emeco aluminum furniture is made from at least 80% recycled aluminum. Emeco plastic seating is made from recycled PET or reclaimed polypropylene, both of which are in turn recyclable.
Specifying Emeco furniture contributes to credit #5.1, Regionally Manufactured Materials when shipped projects within 500 miles of our Hanover, PA facility – cities on the East Coast from Boston through Washington, DC. In addition, the recycled aluminum used in Emeco products is processed in Baltimore, MD, adding another credit contribution.
Specifying the Emeco 111 Navy Chair contributes to credit #5.1, Regionally Manufactured Materials when shipped projects within 500 miles of our Lenoir, NC facility – cities on the East Coast from Washington, DC through Miami. In addition, the recycled PET plastic used in the Emeco 111 Navy Chair is processed in Cavendish, VT, adding another credit contribution.
Aluminum does not emit VOCs or aldehydes in any measurable concentration, therefore gassing requirements are not applicable.
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a division of the US Green Building Council, a government sponsored organization whose goal is to promote environmentalism in the building industry. For more information visit www.usgbc.org.

Intellectual Property Protection
Why protecting original design is important to us
Material Considerations
Our purpose is to create chairs with the utmost consideration for environment. For us, the material is at the heart of everything we make. The invisible design considerations are as important as the visible ones. When possible, we avoid using virgin materials, and instead develop innovative methods to upcycle waste materials and make timeless chairs that last. It takes years of working with material scientists and engineers to make the best possible products for our customers and the planet. Counterfeiters use the least expensive materials with no regard for the environment or longevity.
Many new innovations are created when exploring the best solutions to difficult problems. For example, for the upcycled rPET material that we developed for our 111 Navy Chair in a joint venture with Coca-Cola, a special non-toxic pigment was created to color chairs. This non-toxic pigment is now used by many other industries. It took four years to develop this innovative upcycled rPET, but well worth it! Each year, the 111 Navy collection keeps over 10 million bottles out of landfills. Our material development never stops; over a decade later, we advanced the capability of the material further for our On & On collection by Barber & Osgerby. The goal is a closed-loop system where each chair can be recycled and made into a new chair – on and on. Counterfeiters do not do any research and development, no problems are solved or innovations created.
Process Considerations
Our iconic 1006 Navy Chair was originally created for the US Navy in the 1940’s, as they needed a light weight chair for ships and submarines that was non-corrosive, fire proof and strong enough to withstand the tough conditions on board, including the occasional torpedo blast. Emeco developed a unique 77-step process that we still use today to handcraft the 1006 Navy chair from recycled aluminum in our factory in Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA. We guarantee the 1006 Navy chairs for life. Counterfeiters reduce costs by reducing steps in the process. A reduction in the process results in inferior products that are not guaranteed for life.
Design Considerations
Our responsible work and that of our designers is paid for from the sale of our chairs. By choosing authentic design, you are showing consideration for the environment and helping to secure the future creation of original, sustainable design.
If you have any questions or suspicions of product(s) being counterfeit, please contact us. Click here to find a local representative that sells authentic Emeco furniture in your area. If you are based in the US or Europe, you can also shop authentic Emeco products online directly from us.
