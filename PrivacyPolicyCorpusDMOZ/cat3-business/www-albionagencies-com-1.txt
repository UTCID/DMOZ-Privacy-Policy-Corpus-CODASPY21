Privacy Policy
The privacy and security of the personal information pertaining to our customers is important to us. We collect, maintain, and disclose personal information about our customers in connection with the insurance policies our companies provide. Nonpublic personal information that we collect may include name, address, social security number, wage information, driving record, policy coverages, medical information or credit history. It may also include transaction information such as premium payment or claims history.
The information we collect is disclosed only to the insurance companies we work with and the consumer reporting agencies they use to obtain underwriting information.
Because we respect our customers’ privacy, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise disclose identity or other personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.
We only disclose information about our applicants, customers, and former customers as permitted or required by law in conjunction with our normal insurance operations.
