Lost your original life insurance policy?
Do not despair if you are unable to locate your original life insurance policy. In most cases, you do not even need to have your original policy to make a claim or to surrender your policy. For any of these cases, you may simply download an Affidavit of Lost Policy. Once you have had your signature notarized on the Affidavit, you may use it in lieu of the original policy.
For your protection, all Affidavits of Lost Policy will be verified with the policy owner's signature we have on file.
If you would still like to have a duplicate copy of your policy, you may request one by e-mailing our Policyholder Services Dept. or you may call us toll-free at 1-800-880-2112. It has been the Company's experience that most people that request a duplicate policy find it later. Therefore, we do not issue duplicate policies for one year after your initial request. If you still have not located your policy after a year of your first request for a duplicate copy, then notify us again and we will be happy to provide you one.
