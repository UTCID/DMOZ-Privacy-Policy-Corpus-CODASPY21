Frequently asked questions
I have upgraded to iOS 14.2 and I can’t set up my VELUX ACTIVE with Netatmo. What should I do?
A bug has occurred in iOS 14.2, preventing the full Wi-Fi configuration of VELUX ACTIVE.
NOTE:
This does NOT impact the day-to-day use of your VELUX ACTIVE app. Only the initial product setup and its Wi-Fi reconfiguration are affected.
If you have updated your iOS device to 14.2, here is a workaround to help you set up VELUX ACTIVE:
USE THE iOS Wi-Fi SETTINGS
You can use the iOS Wi-Fi settings to configure your product. Please follow the steps below.
Open your VELUX ACTIVE app.
If you are:
Trying to reconfigure the Wi-Fi of your product, go to Settings > Home Management > VELUX Gateway > Setup Wi-Fi.
Setting up the product for the first time, select VELUX ACTIVE in the list.
Follow the steps within the app to put VELUX ACTIVE in Wi-Fi configuration mode.
When you can see this screen, go to your iOS Wi-Fi settings WITHOUT force quitting the VELUX ACTIVE app.
Wait for your product to appear in the “Set up new device” section of the screen (this might take a few minutes).
Select your Wi-Fi network in the list and press “Next”.
When the “Setup Complete” screen appears, immediately return to the VELUX ACTIVE app.
Follow the steps in the app to finish the setup.
If you use an Android device or an iOS device that has not been updated to iOS 14.2, you can complete the installation of VELUX ACTIVE without going through these steps.
Where can I find the MAC address and/or serial number of my product?
If your gateway is already installed, you can find the MAC address in the VELUX ACTIVE app. Go to: Settings > Home management > Gateway > MAC address and look for the 12-character code: "70: ee :50: xx: xx: xx". If you haven't installed your gateway, you can find the MAC address printed on the back of the gateway. Look for the 7-character code in the format "g:xx:xx:xx" (the last part of the gateway serial number which is located on the 3rd line).
I cannot connect my VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO to my Wi-Fi network. What should I do?
"Some Wi-Fi networks are incompatible with the VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO gateway:
- Public and enterprise networks.
- Networks that only use the 5GHz band.
- Networks behind an authentication portal.
Make sure your smartphone is properly connected to a functional Wi-Fi network before beginning the installation.
Then follow these steps:
1. Reboot the Wi-Fi router and smartphone.
2. Check the gateway is connected to power (small wihite LED is on next to the mains cable)
3. If you have any Wi-Fi boosters/repeaters in your network, make sure each available access point has a different name (SSID) and check that the gateway is being connected to the access point with the strongest signal.
If the above steps doesn't solve your problem, then you should check your router settings by connecting to the router's configuration page (refer to your router's user manual).
- Update the router to its latest firmware version.
- Set a simpler Wi-Fi password, without special characters.
- Ensure there is no MAC filtering enabled on the router (or make sure the gateway is in the white-list).
- Ensure access restrictions (parental control, etc.) are disabled.
- Check if the router has a sleep function. If so, disable that function
- Disable the Wi-Fi channel restriction (enable automatic selection), or select channel 1, 6 or 11.
- Check that 2.4GHz is also enabled if the router is dual band compatible (VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO can only connect to 2.4GHz networks). Try also to disable 5GHz.
- Check that UPnP is enabled.
- Try to replace the current DNS servers with Google's (Primary: 8.8.8.8 / Secondary: 8.8.4.4).
- Check if your router has any firewall / port filtering. If so, open the 25050 port (TCP).
- Give the gateway a static IP with it's MAC address."

Open the app and locate: "Settings > Active control > Room" to define the operating hours for that room (i.e. 8am to 9pm). Repeat this step for each room.
Can I turn off VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO in one room and leave it on in another?
Yes, it is possible to disable VELUX ACTIVE in one room while continuing to have automated control in another room. Open the app and locate: "Settings > Active control" and select the room in which you want to disable VELUX ACTIVE. You can now turn off all ACTIVE control for that room – or define the operating hours for the room.
How does VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO measure the room temperature?
The room temperature is measured by the indoor climate sensor. The temperature is measured every 20 seconds within the 0-50°C / 32-122°F range.
The temperature displayed in the app differs from another thermometer measurement. What should I do?
VELUX ACTIVE temperature sensor measurements that are different from the measurement of another thermometer in the room could be caused by an improper installation point. Check that the sensor is not placed in direct sunlight, above a heating element, behind a curtain, near an open window or door. Remove the sensor and move it to a different position.
How does VELUX ACTIVE  with NETATMO measure the humidity level of the room?
Humidity is measured by the indoor climate sensor installed on the wall in your room. The humidity measurement is updated every 20 seconds and is measured within the range 0-100% with ± 3% accuracy.
How does VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO measure the carbon dioxide level (CO2) of the room?
The carbon dioxide (CO2) level of the room is measured by the indoor climate sensor installed on the wall in your room. The CO2 measurement is updated every 5 minutes and is measured within the 0-5000 ppm range.
My sensor does not work. What should I do?
If no sensor measurement values are displayed in your app, it may be due to a battery or communication issue.
First check the battery level of the sensor.
- Check the sensor battery level by opening the app and locating: "Settings > Home management > Room > Sensor switch > Battery level".
- Remove the batteries, wait a few seconds before re-inserting them and then check if the LED is blinking on the front face of the switch.
Then check the radio signal quality between the sensor and the gateway.
- Check the sensor radio signal quality by opening the app and locating: "Settings > Home management > Room > Sensor switch > Radio signal".
- Move the sensor closer to the gateway.
I can't see any rain measurement level in the app. What can I do?
The rain sensor provided with your VELUX skylight is connected directly to the motor control. No information is transmitted to the app when rain is detected and the skylight closes (rain detection is handled locally by the skylight). The VELUX ACTIVE app will only provides a warning if the skylight is opened while it's raining.
Some sensor measurements are not displayed. What can I do?
If some or all your sensor values are missing, then your sensor may be unreachable (this will be indicated in the app). Please check the sensor batteries and replace them if needed. If only your carbon dioxide (CO2) value is missing, but the humidity and temperature levels are displayed correctly, then wait for 5-10 minutes to see if a measurement appears. The CO2 level is only measured every 5 minutes and this may occur after a battery replacement.
If none of these actions have made the sensor values appear, then your sensor needs to be replaced.
Note: CO2 measures will not be displayed up to 12 hours after initial installation due to calibration of the sensor.
How often must I replace the batteries in the sensor and departure switch?
The sensor and departure switch have a typical battery life of 2 years under normal operation. The sensor and departure switch will remain fully functional up to 7 days after entering the low battery state.

HomeKit
How can I get the most out of Apple HomeKit?
You can use Apple HomeKit to control your VELUX products through Siri (Apple's voice assistant). Use your voice to open your skylight and blinds or to ask about the current air quality status of your home. Apple HomeKit also enables you to create scenarios that connect your VELUX products and other HomeKit compatible devices.
My VELUX skylights are properly paired with VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO, but they do not work with Apple HomeKit. What should I do?
If Apple HomeKit is not working with your VELUX skylights, check your data synchronization:
- Unplug (power off) the gateway for at least 30 seconds and plug it in again.
- Wait for the iCloud synchronization to finish on all connected devices using the same Apple account.
You can force synchronization, by connecting your iPhone to the charger and restarting it. If this doesn't work, you will need to reset the HomeKit configuration and connect it again.
I cannot configure Apple HomeKit
"If you have already configured HomeKit with another iOS device, please refer to the FAQ: ""How do I share the control of Apple HomeKit?"" to get an invitation.
Otherwise, follow the below steps:
First, reset the HomeKit pairing of your gateway:
- Remove the gateway from the Home app in case you see it in your Home app.
- Verify your smartphone is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your gateway.
- Verify that your gateway is powered and that no LED is blinking at the back the gateway.
- Press and hold the button marked with the gear icon.
- When you see the LED blink red, release the button and press it once again quickly to confirm the reset.
- The gateway will now reset and reboot automatically.
- Wait until the LED at the back of the gateway glows in white.
Second, reconfigure the Wi-Fi access of the gateway:
- Open the VELUX app and select ""Settings""
- Select ""Home management""
- Select ""VELUX Gateway""
- Select ""Setup Wi-Fi"" and follow the instructions.
Finally, pair your gateway with HomeKit:
- Open the VELUX app and select ""Settings""
- Select ""Home management""
- Select ""VELUX Gateway""

Why is my home unlocking when I open a skylight with Apple HomeKit?
HomeKit relies on a secured local protocol provided and designed by Apple. Apple HomeKit requires you to be at home and connected to your Wi-Fi network. VELUX ACTIVE considers this safe and unlocks your home when an Apple HomeKit command is executed. It is only possible to access HomeKit when you are away from home, if you are using an Apple home hub (such as an Apple TV or an iPad).
Note: Be careful using HomeKit automation when you are away from home, as this could result in your home unlocking.
Apple HomeKit does not work when I am away from home. What should I do?
To control your products with Siri and Apple HomeKit when you are away from your home (not connected to your home Wi-Fi network), you need to set up a device as a HomeKit home hub. This can be:
- An Apple TV4 with tvOS 10 or later.
- An iPad with iOS 10 or later.
I can't control my VELUX skylights or blinds using Siri voice control. What should I do?
You can use Siri voice control by pressing the home button, by pressing the side button or by saying the phrase: "Hey Siri". To use the "Hey Siri" command on your device, you must activate it by entering: Settings > Siri & Search > Listen for "Hey Siri".
Tip! When naming your rooms and products, you should be careful not to use the room type within the product name, as this can cause a naming conflict. Keep room type names (Bathroom, Kitchen) for the rooms and product type names (Skylight, Blind) for the products. This will provide optimal integration with Siri (Apple HomeKit) voice commands as well. If you are using English language for Siri (for best voice recognition), you should name your rooms and products with English terms for best performance.
Where can I find the Apple HomeKit setup code for VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO?
During VELUX ACTIVE setup, you will be asked to scan the HomeKit setup code with the camera of your device.
The 8 digit Apple HomeKit code (xxx-xx-xxx) can be found on:
- The label at the back of your gateway.
- The last page of the Quick Start Guide provided in the packaging.
You can also enter the code manually if you cannot scan it with the device camera.
If you did not configure HomeKit during the initial installation, simply do it by selecting: "Settings > Home management > Gateway > Set up HomeKit"
How do I share the control of Apple HomeKit?
You can share control of HomeKit accessories with other people if they use iOS 10 or later and are signed in to iCloud.
To share control, you will need to be either at home or have a home hub set up in your home when sending an invite.
In the VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO app locate: "Settings > Home management > HomeKit > Invite".
In the Apple Home app locate: "The "arrow icon" in the upper-left corner > Invite > Enter the person's Apple ID used with iCloud > Send Invite".
Can I add the gateway to Apple HomeKit app without installing the app?
Yes, you can install the gateway using Apple HomeKit (and not the VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO app). Please follow the instructions provided in this link.
Note: For these installations, you can only use the functionality provided by Apple HomeKit and the Apple Home app. The ACTIVE automatic algorithms are not included in Apple HomeKit and can only be accessed by using the VELUX ACTIVE app.
