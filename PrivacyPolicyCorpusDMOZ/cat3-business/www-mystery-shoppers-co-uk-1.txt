How Mystery Shopping Can Help Your Business
We offer an accurate, reliable and inexpensive method of quality control which provides you with a means of identifying both good customer service (which can be rewarded) and the not-so-good (which can be performance managed).
We reach a full understanding of your company, its employees and clients in order to be able to provide you with a full scale picture of how each action affects your business. Our services are tailored to meet the exact needs of the business and an individual programme is installed for each of our clients, however, some of the methods are as below.
We provide periodic reports and statistics to enable you to track customer service performance.
We monitor your customer service by visiting/calling/emailing nominated outlets at an agreed frequency.
We extend your quality assurance programme to the intangible elements of your customer service.
We help you to look at your business through the eyes of your customers.
We help you ensure all your outlets are giving a consistent level of customer service.
We help you spot any employees who may be driving your customers away.
We check the service provided by each branch against your laid-down customer service standards.
We provide a measuring facility for inter-branch competitions and personal performance rewards.
We confirm whether your staff are promoting those services and products they have been instructed to promote.
We check that advice and information your employees are giving is accurate and conforms to any legal guidelines which may apply.
We benchmark your service against that offered by your competitors.
Shoppers are selected from our database according to their location and their suitability in terms of the type of product or service involved. We can, if you wish, recruit shoppers to match your own customer profile or even recruit from your own customer database.
Once our quality control process is completed, assessment forms are uploaded to your client portal for review, together with any audio, video or other media files which can be streamed from the site so you can see/hear the assessment in progress at the same time as reading the report.  We are also able to provide a summary report (and presentations if required) at an agreed frequency.
Our reports will enable you to track the effect of product changes as well as customer service and staff training programmes. They will enable you to compare the performance of each outlet and reward those which demonstrate the best customer service. This is especially important where sales incentive programmes may lead staff to make short-term sales a higher priority than long-term customer satisfaction.
