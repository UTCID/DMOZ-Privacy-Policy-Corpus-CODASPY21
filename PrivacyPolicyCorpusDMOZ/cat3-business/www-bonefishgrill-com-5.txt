The Program.
The Dine Rewards program (the “Program”) allows you to earn
rewards in connection with your visits to participating Bloomin’ Brands, Inc.
(“BBI”) restaurants: Outback Steakhouse®, Bonefish Grill®,
Carrabba’s Italian Grill®, and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar®,
and to redeem those cumulative visits for rewards (collectively,
“Rewards”), as provided in these “Terms and
Conditions.”  Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully, and
keep them with your records. By enrolling in the Program, you agree to these Terms and
Conditions, as they may be modified from time to time in our sole discretion (with the
exceptions noted in Section 19, below). This Program is void where prohibited by federal,
state, or local law, and Rewards may be restricted by federal, state, or local law.
THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCLUDE A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING TO SUE IN
COURT OR TO PURSUE A CLASS ACTION. SEE SECTION 19, BELOW.
Definitions.
In these Terms and Conditions:
“Administrator” means any company we engage to provide
administrative services for the Program. The Program is a service of Bloomin’
Brands managed by Administrators who are solely responsible for the administrative
services for the Program.
“Member” means the person identified in our records as
the holder (or owner) of the Rewards Account. “Program
Website” refers to www.dine-rewards.com
“Bloomin’ Brands,” “we,” “our,”
“ours,” and “us” refer to
Bloomin’ Brands and all of its affiliates and subsidiaries, or its and their
assignees. “Rewards
Account” refers to the record of the visits and other offers you
have earned and redeemed through the Program.
“Suppliers” mean any independent third party that we or
the Administrator engages to provide services, Rewards, or other benefits for the
Program.
“You” and “your” refer to
any person or entity participating in the Program.
Program Eligibility.
To be eligible to create a Rewards Account, participate in the Program and earn and redeem
Rewards, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a valid email address and mobile
phone number. A Rewards Account is unique to the individual Member holding the account and
may be associated only with a single email address and mobile phone number. The same mobile
phone number may not be associated with more than one Rewards Account, nor may the same
email address be associated with more than one Rewards Account. The Dine Rewards Member or
immediate family member of the Member must be present to earn rewards for the transaction.
In addition to the rights set forth in Section 11 hereof, at BBI’s sole discretion and
without the necessity of notice to you, Rewards Accounts created in violation of these
requirements are subject to suspension until such accounts are brought into compliance by
the Member, and/or such accounts and associated Rewards may be modified by BBI to bring such
Rewards Accounts into compliance.
Participating Locations.
Program Members may earn and redeem rewards only at participating Outback Steakhouse,
Bonefish Grill, Carrabba’s Italian Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse &
Wine Bar locations, which are subject to change from time to time at BBI’s discretion.
Enrollment and Rewards.
You may enroll in the Program by visiting our Website or mobile site and following the
enrollment instructions. Each Member will have access to a personal Rewards Account page
during the course of his/her membership. You may access your Rewards Account, by visiting
the Website, and signing in to your account. It is your sole responsibility to safeguard any
passwords associated with your Rewards Account and to make sure that your contact
information in your Rewards Account remains current and complete; BBI disclaims any
responsibility for the accuracy of a Member’s Rewards Account contact information.
Once you have successfully enrolled in the Dine Rewards™ Program, you may begin
earning Rewards by performing the qualifying activities described below. You will not
receive credit for any activity that occurred prior to your enrollment. You may continue to
earn Rewards so long as BBI, in its sole discretion, determines that you are eligible for
participation in the Program.
Enrollment Bonus via Referral:  Upon enrollment in the
Program via a Referral link only, a Member will receive a bonus of $5 that can be used
at Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill or Carrabba’s Italian Grill participating
locations, or $10 that can be used at Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar
participating locations. The Enrollment Bonus via Referral must be used within sixty
(60) days from the date it was issued. The Enrollment Bonus via Referral is valid for
food and non-alcoholic beverage purchases only, and has no cash value.   Referral Bonus:  Members may be asked to refer friends or
family to the Dine Rewards program using a special referral code unique to each Member
("Referral Link"). A Member will receive a referral bonus of $5 for each new Member: 1)
that signs up for the Dine Rewards program using the Referral Link, and 2) has a minimum
qualifying spend amount of $20 at any of our participating locations ($40 at
Fleming’s) within sixty (60) days after signing up for the Program. The minimum
qualifying spend amount means the amount of the bill excluding any purchases of gift
cards and alcohol, and any applied discounts, enrollment bonus, taxes, and tip. The
Referral Bonus awarded to the referring Member must be used within sixty (60) days from
the date it is issued. Multiple Referral Bonus Rewards can be redeemed during a single
visit up to a maximum of four (4) Referral Bonus Rewards for a daily Reward maximum
total of $20. Effective June 15, 2018, a Member cannot accrue or obtain more than 10
Referral Bonus Rewards in a three hundred and sixty-five (365) day period. Referral
Bonus Rewards cannot be used via online ordering or apps, and cannot be combined with
any other Rewards that may be in the referring Member’s account. The Referral
Bonus is valid for food and non-alcoholic beverage purchases only, and has no cash
value. Members can share their Referral Link to friends and family but cannot post the
link on any paid advertising mediums or through a bot. Upon discovery of use of a
Referral Link posted on any paid advertising medium or via a bot, the Member’s
Referral Bonuses will be invalidated.   Program Rewards:  This Program is a frequency based
Program that allows you to earn Rewards based on the number of visits (with a minimum
spending requirement) at any of our brand participating locations, as described below.
In order to receive a
Reward, you must visit any of our participating locations, at any of our brands,
three (3) times in a rolling six (6) month period (beginning with your first visit
after becoming a Member), and have a minimum qualifying spend per visit of $20 at
Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill or Carrabba’s Italian Grill, or $40 at
Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar. The minimum qualifying spend amount
means the amount of your bill on each visit excluding any purchases of gift cards
and alcohol, and any applied discounts, enrollment bonus, taxes, and tip. Each
participating restaurant visit by a Member that meets the required minimum spend
will be deemed a single qualifying visit for purposes of the Program. Each
Member’s visit to a participating location may qualify only once as a
qualifying visit. You must identify yourself as a Member to your server for a
qualifying visit to be credited to your Reward Account. Members are limited to a
maximum of two (2) qualifying visits per calendar day at least two (2) hours apart.
Upon successfully
achieving the required visits and minimum qualifying spend, your Rewards Account
will be credited with a Reward consisting of 50% off of your next (4th) visit to a
participating location, limited to the maximum discount as described below. Members visiting our
participating brand locations may redeem their Reward as follows: 50% off (up to a
maximum discount of $20) at Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill or Carrabba’s
Italian Grill, or 50% off (up to a maximum discount of $40) at Fleming’s Prime

number 877-546-7407.
You must report any errors in your Rewards Account that are related to Rewards earned,
adjusted or redeemed within thirty (30) days after the date the error appears on the

any such corrections will be made at our sole discretion. To receive credit for a visit, an
itemized receipt or credit card payment receipt that contains the date of the visit and the
total amount spent must be submitted. A Member can submit the request at https://www.dine-rewards.com/dashboard/contact-us/add-a-visit
or by contacting our Rewards Service Center at 877-546-7407 or dinerewards@bloominbrands.com. In order
to receive credit, you must be a registered Member at the time of the visit. We will not be
liable for any damages resulting from any failure to credit Rewards to your Rewards Account
in a timely manner.
Redeeming Rewards.
Members may redeem Rewards:
By visiting a
participating restaurant location and identifying himself/herself as a Member to
their server and asking for the server to apply the reward discount.
You can redeem a Reward only if your Rewards Account shows that you have the required
number of visits for that particular Reward. When you redeem a Reward, we will subtract
the Reward from your total accumulated balance as shown on your Rewards Account. Rewards
that have not yet been credited to your Rewards Account are not available and cannot be
redeemed until such time as they have been credited to your account. Members may earn
only those Rewards described on the Program Website, as may change from time to time at
our sole discretion. From time to time, we may send you electronic updates of current
Rewards.   All Rewards are subject to availability, have no cash value, are non-transferable, and
cannot be purchased or sold for cash. Additional restrictions may apply. Bloomin’
Brands and the Administrator may alter, substitute, withdraw, change, discontinue,
temporarily suspend, terminate or replace any Reward for any reason at any time without
notice to you. Neither the Administrator, Suppliers, nor Bloomin’ Brands
guarantees or represents that any specific Reward will be available for any particular
length of time. Neither the Administrator, Suppliers, nor Bloomin’ Brands will be
responsible for errors, omissions, or delays in the handling or delivery of Rewards.
Unredeemed Rewards will expire ninety (90) days from the date on which they were credited
to your Rewards Account. Rewards will be redeemed and/or expired on a first-in,
first-out basis. Rewards have no partial or residual value. Rewards cannot be combined
or reinstated, and cannot be bought, sold or transferred in any way.
Tax Liability and Fees.
You will be responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes resulting from your earning
or redeeming Rewards.
Program Changes and Termination. The Program is offered at the sole discretion of BBI. We reserve the right, in our sole
discretion and at any time: (a) to terminate or suspend the Program, in whole or in
part; and (b) to add, delete, or otherwise change any of the Terms and Conditions,
including changes to fees and charges, changes to the activities by which Rewards may be
earned, and changes that may reduce or cancel the redemption value of Rewards credited
but not yet redeemed. If we change the Terms and Conditions to provide Rewards for a new
activity, no Rewards will be awarded for any activity that occurred prior to the
effective date of the change. We may change the Terms and Conditions without prior
notice to you, but the current version of the Terms and Conditions will be posted on the
Program Website. By continuing to participate in the Program following any change in the
Terms and Conditions, you are accepting the changes to the Terms and Conditions.
In addition, we reserve the right to terminate your participation in the Program and to
invalidate all or a portion of your Rewards balance, whether or not credited to your
Rewards Account (a) in the event of any abuse or fraud relating to the earning or
redemption of Rewards, and/or any violation of the Terms and Conditions (including any
attempt to sell, exchange, encumber or transfer Rewards); or (b) for your failure to
meet eligibility requirements. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
determine whether termination or disqualification is appropriate. We reserve the right
to deny access to your account or account history in the event your account is
terminated. These rights are in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy that may
be available to Bloomin’ Brands under applicable law.   You may terminate your participation in the Program at any time by contacting us at
877-546-7407. A period of extended inactivity on a Rewards Account may result in the
termination of such account. In the event we terminate the Program, your Rewards
Account, or you terminate your participation in the Program, within the ninety (90) days
following this event you may redeem any Rewards that have been credited to your Rewards
Account, unless such Rewards have been invalidated as set forth in the preceding
paragraph, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. You will forfeit any Rewards
that you do not redeem within this ninety (90) day period.

all Rewards, correspondence, transaction confirmations and other information from us
electronically through access to the Program Website, your Rewards Account on the
Program Website or the email address provided by you to us. We will not be responsible
for your inability to connect to the Internet or to access the Program Website or

Information We Collect and Use.
Information collected from Members is subject to Sponsor’s Privacy Policy, located at
http://www.bloominbrands.com/ourcompany/privacypolicy.aspx.
By applying for enrollment in, and participating in the Program, you are agreeing that we
may use your information as described in our Privacy Policy. You are also agreeing to review
these Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy regularly so that you can make informed
decisions about your use of our Program Website, your participation in the Program, and the
personal information you choose to share with us. You may obtain a copy of the
Bloomin’ Brands Privacy Policy at any time from any Bloomin’ Brands customer
service representative by calling 877-645-7407 or by visiting http://www.bloominbrands.com/ourcompany/privacypolicy.aspx
Disputes.
You agree that whenever
you have a disagreement with us arising out of, connected to, or in any way related
to the Terms and Conditions and/or Program, you will send a written notice to us
(“Demand”). You agree that the requirements of this Section 19 will
apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms and
Conditions. You must send this Demand to the following address (the “Notice
Address”): Bloomin’ Brands, Inc., Attn: Chief Legal Officer, 2202 N.
West Shore Blvd., Suite 500, Tampa, FL 33607. You agree that you will
not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration,
until ten (10) business days after you send this Demand. If we do not resolve this
disagreement to your satisfaction within ten (10) business days, and you intend on
taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the
American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). Please note that for any
such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must affect proper service under the
rules of the AAA, and that notice to the Notice Address may not suffice. If, for any
reason, the AAA is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your case with
any national arbitration company. The arbitrator shall apply the AAA
Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedure as effective September 15, 2005.
You agree that the arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any
dispute you have with us. You understand that the Federal Arbitration Act allows for
the enforcement of arbitration agreements, and you agree that it applies. You agree that you will
not file any lawsuit against us in any state or federal court. You waive any right
to a trial by a jury or a state or federal judge. You agree that if you do sue us in
state or federal court, and we bring a successful motion to compel arbitration, you
must pay all fees and costs incurred by us in court, including reasonable
attorney’s fees. You agree that you will not file a class action or collective
action against us, and that you will not participate in a class action or collective
action against us. You agree that you will not join your claims to those of any
other person. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions, if
this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to arbitrate is null and
void, as though it were never entered into. Any dispute at that time in arbitration
will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled in a court. Under no circumstances
do you or we agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder
of claims in arbitration. We agree that we will
not file a class or collective action against you, and that we will not participate
in a class or collective action against you, for any disagreement arising out of,
connected to, or in any way related to these Terms and Conditions and/or Program. We
agree that we will submit all disputes with you to arbitration before the
Arbitrator.
Notwithstanding any
other provision herein, you will not be bound by any changes we make to this Section
19 unless you are provided prior notice by mail, e-mail, text, or other direct
notification and do not cancel your enrollment. If you do cancel your enrollment in
the Program, you will still be bound to the most recent Terms and Conditions
operative when your enrollment was active.
Choice of Law.
All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and
enforceability of these Terms and Conditions, or the rights and obligations of the Member,
Bloomin’ Brands and Administrator in connection with the Program and these Terms and
Conditions, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Florida, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the
State of Florida or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the State of Florida. MEMBER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE PROGRAM, THE GRANTING OF
REWARDS AND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER
SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.
Miscellaneous Terms.
If at any time any provision of these Terms and Conditions is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction as being illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision will be deemed to be removed from these Terms and Conditions and replaced with a
lawful provision most closely approximating the intent of the stricken provision (except as
noted in Section 19); and, the illegality/invalidity/unenforceability of any stricken
provision shall not affect the legality or validity or enforceability of any other provision
of these Terms and Conditions (except as noted in Section 19). No delay by Bloomin’
Brands in enforcing the provisions of these Terms and Conditions in any given instance will
in any way prejudice or restrict the rights of Bloomin’ Brands nor will any waiver of
rights by Bloomin’ Brands in any given instance operate as a waiver of any subsequent
breach by any person of any provision of these Terms and Conditions.
Disclosure Applicable to California Residents: Non-Discrimination and Financial
Incentive Programs
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise
your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different
level or quality of goods or services, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to
the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the
collection, Sale, retention, and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA; such offers may
result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any
financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.
Entire Agreement.
These Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement
between you and us with respect to the Program and your participation in it, and any and all
prior agreements with respect to any other rewards program are superseded by these Terms and
Conditions. These Terms and Conditions and the Program are governed by the state and US
laws, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. Our failure to exercise or enforce
any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such
right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and we agree that the court should endeavor to
give effect to your and our intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other
provisions of the Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect.
