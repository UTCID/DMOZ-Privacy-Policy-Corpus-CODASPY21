Disclosure Of  Your Information
When the information we collect about you is aggregated, anonymized, or otherwise does not identify you, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
In addition, we may share your information with the following entities:

Other parties for any purpose we disclose at the time you provide the information.
We reserve the right to disclose your information as necessary to comply with a subpoena or investigative demand, court order, request for cooperation from law enforcement or other governmental agency, to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims, or as otherwise required by law.
Your Choices About Your Information
We strive to provide you with choices regarding your personal information.  When you are signed into your user account on our website, you may choose to delete your account.  Doing so will remove any information about you in our website registration system.  Likewise, to the extent we ever send you promotional emails, you can stop receiving those emails by clicking the  “unsubscribe” link in the email.  We endeavor to promptly process any unsubscribe requests.  You can also choose not to provide us with information requested through our website, which may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website (such as our Download Center) or receive certain information about our business and services (such as technical drawings and CAD files).
Links To Third-Party Websites
Our website may contain links to third-party websites.  These websites have separate privacy policies that you should review.  While we make efforts to choose the links on our website carefully, we cannot take responsibility for the content of linked websites or those companies’ data-handling practices.
Protection Of Your Information
We understand the importance of safeguarding your information and take appropriate administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.  Please be aware, however, that no security measures or data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.  While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
International Transfers
SENS is headquartered in the United States and, as a result, the information you provide to us will reside on servers in the United States.  If your information was collected outside the United States, it may be necessary to transfer your information to the United States for processing in order to provide you with requested products.  You understand and consent that information you provide may be transferred to and processed in the United States.  The data protection laws in the United States may not be the same as the data protection laws in your home country.
GDPR And EEA Residents’ Rights
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a privacy law that affords certain rights relating to the personal information of individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  If you are located in the EEA, you may request that we identify whether we are processing your personal information, our purposes in doing so, how your personal information was obtained (if you did not provide it to us directly), who it may have been shared with, and how long it will be retained.  Further, you have the right to request your personal information be corrected if it is inaccurate and, in certain circumstances, may ask that it be erased and withdraw your consent or object to further processing.  Finally, subject to certain limitations, and when feasible, you may request a copy of your personal information or that it be transferred to another entity.  You will not typically need to pay a fee to exercise any of these rights.  But we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Subject to exceptions, if you wish to exercise one of the rights identified above with regard to personal information subject to this Policy, you may do so by submitting a written request using the Contact Webmaster form at the bottom of our Privacy website page.  This is normally free, unless this process is unduly difficult or is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive, in which case we may charge a reasonable fee or decline to respond.  Once we have received your request, we will review it and contact you within 30 days of our receipt of your request, but we will notify you of any delay and, in any event, will reply within three (3) months.  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights).
Lastly, if you are located in the EEA and have a concern about our processing of your data, you may have the right to make a complaint to the appropriate data protection authority in the EEA.
Additional Information Regarding Processing Under The GDPR
For personal information subject to GDPR, SENS acts as a “controller.” Most of the time, our lawful basis for processing your information under the GDPR will either be to (1) perform a contractual obligation with you, (2) fulfill legitimate business interests (such as marketing, ensuring the safety, security, and functionality of the Services, and continuing to develop our offerings), (3) comply with a legal obligation, or (4) conduct processing to which you have specifically consented.
For example, we need to process your personal information in order to provide you with the products you have purchased.  In that circumstance, our lawful basis for the processing of your personal information is to perform our contractual obligations to you.  Likewise, it may be necessary to our legitimate business interests of growing and continuing our services to use your personal information in order to communicate with you regarding the products you have purchased and other products that we believe may be of interest.
As indicated previously, your personal information may be transferred to our servers in the United States.  The United States has not received an “adequacy finding” from the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR.  SENS relies on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR.  SENS collects and transfers personal information to the U.S. only with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest that does not outweigh your rights or freedoms.  We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Policy.   SENS will enter into data processing agreements with its vendors when feasible and appropriate.
Children’s Privacy
Our website is a general audience site and is not directed at, or intended for use by, children under the age of 13 years.  Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13.
Do-Not-Track Disclosure
Please note that SENS does not honor “Do Not Track” signals and such signals will not impact the operation of our website.
Changes To This Privacy Policy
Please note that we may change this Policy from time to time.  We will post changes here and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. Continued use of this website after any changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes.  We encourage you to check the Policy periodically for updates.
