Privacy tools that put you in control.
When it comes to privacy, we know one size does not fit all.
That’s why we build controls that are easy to use so you can
choose the privacy settings that are right for you.
Google Account
Easy-to-use privacy settings, all in one place
You can find key information, privacy, and security settings all in your Google Account. We have created easy-to-use tools like Dashboard and My Activity, which give you transparency data collected from your activity across Google services. There are also powerful privacy controls like Activity Controls and Ad Settings, which allow you to switch the collection and use of data on or off to decide how all of Google can work better for you.
Quickly access your key privacy settings
Your Google Account is always easy to find in our most popular services like Search, Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and Assistant. Just tap on your profile picture and follow the link
to your account.

Activity Controls
Control what data gets saved
Using Activity Controls, you can decide what types of activity are tied to your account to personalize your experience across Google services. You can pause specific types of data from being saved in your account – like your Search and browsing activity, YouTube History, or Location History.
Go to Activity Controls
Auto-Delete
Set your data to automatically delete
To give you even more control, Auto-delete settings let you choose a time limit for how long you want to keep your activity data. Data older than the limit you choose will be continuously and automatically deleted from your account. This makes it easy for you to set it and forget it, but you can always go back and update these settings at any time.

My Activity
Delete data from your account anytime
My Activity is the central place where you can find everything you’ve searched, viewed, and watched using our services. To make it easier to recall your past online activity, we give you tools to search by topic, date, and product. You can permanently delete specific activities or even entire topics that you don’t want associated with your account.

Incognito Mode
Turn on Incognito mode in Chrome, Search, YouTube, and Maps
First launched in Chrome, Incognito mode has since become available in our most popular apps. In YouTube, Search on iOS, and Maps, just tap from your profile picture to easily turn it on or off. When you turn on Incognito mode in Maps and YouTube, your activity, like the places you search for or the videos you watch, won't be saved to your Google Account. Browsing history and cookies from your Incognito session are deleted from Chrome once you close all Incognito windows.
Your Data In
Control your data,
right from your apps
We’ve made it easier for you to make decisions about your data directly within the Google services you use every day. For example, without ever leaving Search, you can review and delete your recent Search activity, get quick access to relevant privacy controls from your Google Account, and learn more about how Search works with your data. You can access these controls in Search, Maps, and Google Assistant.
