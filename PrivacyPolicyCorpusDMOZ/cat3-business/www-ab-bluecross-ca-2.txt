Effective Date: October 14, 2019
At Alberta Blue Cross, protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy is important to us. We have developed this policy ('Privacy Policy') to explain how we collect, use, and disclose personal information. It is designed to help you obtain information about our privacy practices and to help you understand your privacy choices.
1. Definitions
we, us, and our means Alberta Blue Cross;
you and your means any individual whose personal information we collect, use, and disclose as described in this Privacy Policy; and
personal information means any information that on its own or when put together with other information can identify a person but does not include business contact information or anonymous or de-identified data that is not associated with a particular individual.
2. Scope and Application
This Privacy Policy relates to the personal information collected by us, including via our website and mobile applications.
This Privacy Policy applies to you when you:
apply for, purchase, or receive our products or services;
sign up to be a part of any of our programs, promotions, contests or events; or
visit our premises, website, or mobile applications.
This Privacy Policy does not explain how personal information is managed by our online Balance program. Please refer to the Balance Privacy Statement for details on how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our Balance program.
3. How we limit the collection of personal information
We limit collection of personal information to what is reasonably required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
The type of personal information collected depends on the type of product or service involved:
For example:
We may collect your name, date of birth, and contact information to identify you, set you up in our system or communicate with you;
If you apply for individual or group benefits, we may collect health or lifestyle-related information, such as your occupation, travel history and plans, and employment information such as place of employment and annual income.
We may record or monitor incoming and outgoing calls for quality assurance and training purposes, or to create a record of the information you provided and your instructions;
4. How we collect your personal information
We use different methods to collect your personal information including directly from you, from third parties, through technology, and when you are interacting with us online or through our mobile applications.
A. Directly from you:
We may receive personal information from you, when you provide it to us.
For example:
You may provide personal information to us through a form, in person, by telephone, by email, by our website or other method.
B. From third parties
We may receive personal information about you from other sources that may include:
Your employer or third-party administrator, if you apply for group benefits;
Third parties we work with to issue and manage our products and services, whether now or in the future;
Third parties you allow to disclose information to us, or third-party accounts you allow us to access;
Public sources such as government agencies and websites; and
With your consent, we may gather personal information from your doctor(s) and health care provider(s), and from other insurance companies to confirm or obtain additional information about you.
In these cases, we take steps to ensure the individual providing the personal information understands their obligations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of that personal information. We receive your personal information from these other sources with your consent, or if the law requires or permits us to do so.
For example:
When you have a sponsored plan, we may obtain personal information from Alberta Health, your employer, or another representative. They may provide your personal information to us through application forms, a member site, a phone call, or other methods.
