Buyer also consents to the jurisdiction of Kansas courts over any dispute involving this order. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This order as accepted and approved by Seller constitutes the entire final agreement between the parties. Except as otherwise provided in writing by Seller, the terms set forth herein constitute the sole TERMS AND CONDITIONS for Buyer’s order. Seller’s acceptance of Buyer’s order is expressly conditioned on Buyer’s assent to these TERMS AND CONDITIONS which may not be supplemented, modified, superseded or otherwise altered except as authorized in writing by Seller.

Prices are subject to adjustment without notice and Seller reserves the right to correct errors in prices or specifications. Any quotation (whether written or oral) is not an offer to contract or acceptance of an order. Similarly, neither a price list nor a catalogue constitutes an offer to sell or contract, but are provided solely for customers’ convenience. TAXES Any sales, use, property, or other taxes or duties which Seller may be required to pay or collect (under any existing or future law) in connection with the sale, purchase, delivery, storage, processing, consumption or use of the products purchased herewith shall be for the account of Buyer and Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller therefore. DELIVERIES Delivery dates are estimates only and time shall not be of the essence unless specifically provided by Seller in writing.

Buyer assumes all freight, handling and installation costs and the risk of loss or delay in transit. Seller will assist Buyer with transit arrangements, but Seller shall be free of any liability in connection therewith. Title to all materials and products sold by Seller shall pass to Buyer upon delivery to the carrier and Seller’s responsibility ceases at that time. Risk of loss, injury, or destruction of the products shall be borne by the Buyer and any such loss, injury or destruction shall not release Buyer from payment of the purchase price. INSPECTION Buyer must inspect all materials for shortages, damages, conformity with order and defects before signing any documentation requested by the carrier.

If goods are damaged, defective, shorted or appear not to conform to the order, Buyer shall discontinue their use and immediately notify the carrier and Seller of such condition and afford a reasonable opportunity to inspect the same. Buyer shall make, or provide Seller in writing with all information necessary to make, a claim against such carrier for any shortage, damage, or discrepancy of the shipment within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the goods. Claims or written information thereon not so presented within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the goods will not be allowed.
