How We Use Your Information
When you submit information about yourself in order to request services or information, we collect and use that information only to provide those services.
We will not provide to third-party sources the information you give us when you request services or information. To improve our site and services we collect non-identifying and aggregate information, such as the numbers of people who choose to opt-in for our email newsletter, but none of this information is personally identifiable.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Use of the Internet or email is for your convenience only, and by using them, you assume the risk of unauthorized use.
