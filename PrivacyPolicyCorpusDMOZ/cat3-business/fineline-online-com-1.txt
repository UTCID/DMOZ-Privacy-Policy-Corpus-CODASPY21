Advertising
We use cookies to make advertising more engaging to users and more valuable to publishers and advertisers. Some common applications of cookies are to select advertising based on what’s relevant to a user; to improve reporting on campaign performance and to avoid showing ads that the user has already seen.Google uses cookies like NID and SID to help customise adverts on Google properties, such as Google Search. For example, we use such cookies to remember your most recent searches, your previous interactions with an advertiser’s adverts or search results and your visits to an advertiser’s website. This helps us to show you customised adverts on Google.
We also use one or more cookies for advertising that we serve across the web. One of the main advertising cookies on non-Google sites is named ‘IDE‘ and is stored in browsers under the domain doubleclick.net. Another is stored in google.com and is called ANID. We use other cookies with names such as DSID, FLC, AID, TAID and exchange_uid. Other Google properties, such as YouTube, may also use these cookies to show you more relevant adverts.
Sometimes advertising cookies may be set on the domain of the site that you’re visiting. In the case of advertising we serve across the web, cookies named ‘__gads’ or ‘__gac’ may be set on the domain of the site that you’re visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on Google’s own domains, these cookies can’t be read by Google when you’re on a site other than the one on which they were set. They serve purposes such as measuring interactions with the ads on that domain and preventing the same ads from being shown to you too many times.
Google also uses conversion cookies whose main purpose is to help advertisers determine how many times the people who click on their adverts end up purchasing their products. These cookies allow Google and the advertiser to determine that you clicked on the advert and later visited the advertiser site. Conversion cookies are not used by Google for personalised ad targeting and persist for a limited time only. A cookie named ‘Conversion‘ is dedicated to this purpose. It’s generally set in the googleadservices.com domain or the google.com domain (you can find a list of domains that we use for advertising cookies at the foot of this page). Some of our other cookies may be used to measure conversion events as well. For example, DoubleClick and Google Analytics cookies may also be used for this purpose.
We also use cookies named ‘AID’, ‘DSID’ and ‘TAID’, which are used to link your activity across devices if you’ve previously signed in to your Google Account on another device. We do this to coordinate that the ads you see across devices and measure conversion events. These cookies may be set on the domains google.com/ads, google.com/ads/measurement or googleadservices.com.
