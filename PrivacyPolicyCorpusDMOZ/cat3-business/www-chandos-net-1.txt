Covid-19
During the current unprecedented situation, Chandos Records will remain open as usual. As many of our staff are now working remotely, we would ask you where possible to submit any queries online here rather than by telephone. CD orders are being despatched on the next working day as normal, but understandably delivery times may vary regionally, and may take slightly longer than usual, depending on location. As of 31st March, we will not be dispatching orders to countries placed ‘on suspension’ by UK’s Royal Mail. We thank you for your understanding, and wish all our customers a healthy outcome!
