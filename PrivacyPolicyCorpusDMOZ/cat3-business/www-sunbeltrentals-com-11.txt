iii. Scaffold RPP Exclusions.

THE EXCLUSIONS ARE RISKS ASSUMED BY CUSTOMER AND ARE NOT COVERED BY THE SCAFFOLD RPP.
iv. Recovery of Eligible Equipment. If the Eligible Equipment is recovered at a later date, Sunbelt retains ownership of the Eligible Equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, if lost or stolen Eligible Equipment is later recovered, neither Customer nor Customer’s insurance company shall have any ownership rights to it, regardless of any payments made by Customer or Customer’s insurance company with respect to such Eligible Equipment, all of which payments are non-refundable. Customer agrees to promptly return any Eligible Equipment that is recovered.
v. Subrogation. Sunbelt shall be subrogated to Customer’s rights to recover against any person or entity relating to any loss, theft, damage or destruction to the Eligible Equipment. Customer shall cooperate with, assign Sunbelt all claims and proceeds arising from such loss, theft, damage or destruction, execute and deliver to Sunbelt whatever documents are required and take all other necessary steps to RPP shall mean and include Scaffold RPP in this Contract as applicable.

Additionally, if “Rental Protection Plan” is not elected pursuant to Section three, Paragraph six (6) hereof, Customer shall also at its own expense, provide and maintain insurance against loss by all risks of physical loss or damage such as at least that normally provided by a contractor’s equipment floater policy, in an amount equal to the manufacturer’s list price for the equipment.

Customer must provide certificates of insurance, if requested by Sunbelt, before shipment or delivery of equipment to Customer. If Customer is self-insured, it shall furnish written evidence of such fact all to the satisfaction of Sunbelt. THE PROVIDING OF ANY INSURANCE REQUIRED HEREIN DOES NOT RELIEVE THE CUSTOMER OF ANY OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OR OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED BY THE CUSTOMER IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR WHICH THE CUSTOMER MAY BE LIABLE BY LAW OR OTHERWISE.
