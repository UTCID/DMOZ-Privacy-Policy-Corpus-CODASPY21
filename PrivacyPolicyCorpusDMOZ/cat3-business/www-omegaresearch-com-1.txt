TS Select and TS GO: Available only to U.S. residents. “Commission-free” for equities trades applies only to the first 10,000 shares per trade — for each order of more than 10,000 shares, a $0.005 per share charge will be assessed on the number of shares in excess of 10,000. Direct-routed equity orders will be charged an additional $0.005 per share. There will be a $1.00 per contract fee for index options. Direct routing of options orders incurs an additional $1.00 per contract fee. Basic market data is available at no charge only to non-professional subscribers. Other market data fees may apply if you add markets.
TS GO: TS GO rates apply only to mobile app and web trading. If you are on this plan and place trades using the TradeStation Desktop platform, an additional $10.00 fee will apply to each equities and options trade you make. For futures trades, a $1.40 surcharge per contract will apply. You can avoid these higher desktop fees by using the TS Select price plan.

In order for you to purchase cryptocurrencies using cash, or sell your cryptocurrencies for cash, in a TradeStation Crypto account, you must also have qualified for, and opened, a TradeStation Equities account with TradeStation Securities so that your cryptocurrency purchases may be paid for with cash withdrawals from, and your cryptocurrency cash sale proceeds may be deposited in, your TradeStation Securities Equities account.
