Order Policy
Orders can be submitted via our website, phone, fax, or mail. Submitting orders through the web site is the quickest and preferred method. This will allow us to begin processing your order right away. You can also call us toll-free at 1-800-628-2639 and place your order over the phone.

Business and Individual Orders
We sell to individuals, organizations, and businesses, and have no minimum order requirement.  You can order by the bag, tub, box, tub, or bulk case. Ordering multiple quantities helps lower your shipping cost as compared to the total order cost. You can also place an order and have it shipped to another location - such as a business or to a friend.

Information Security
When you place an order on our site, we protect your credit card number and all personal information by using top level encryption technology. Encryption scrambles your credit card number and personal information, and it remains scrambled while traveling over the internet between your computer and our web site. We use GeoTrust secure socket layer (SSL) encryption, the industry standard for secure ecommerce transactions. Click on GeoTrust to confirm our status is valid. You may need to temporarily unblock pop-ups for the information to display.
Our sites are tested and certified to pass the McAfee Secure Scan. The McAfee Secure mark appears at the bottom of the page only when our sites pass the McAfee Secure tests. We screen for fraudulent orders.
Our sites may request the CVV2 credit card verification value during the checkout process. This is the 3 or 4 digit number printed on your card, and is a security measure recommended by the credit card industry.
