A record of this search will be kept and may be used to help other companies to verify your identity. We may also pass information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect ourselves and our customers from theft and fraud. If you give false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we may record this and share this information with other organisations. By agreeing to accept our Terms and Conditions, you give us authority to undertake such a search if we require.15.4 We may also contact your bank to confirm that the name and address you have supplied us with in relation to the debit card you have registered on your Nochex account corresponds with the records held by your bank.15.5 We reserve the right to charge you a fee of up to £2 in respect of any identification checks we have to complete on you. We also reserve the right to receive the necessary authorisation from your Bank to confirm that monies are available in your account to cover any fee we intend to take. Any fee we apply will be advised to you by email before it is actually debited to your bank account and our checks are concluded.16. Other Points to Note16.1 If either you or we are in breach of these arrangements neither of us shall be responsible for any losses that the other suffers as a result except those losses which are a foreseeable consequence of the breach.

Indemnities15.1 The Merchant shall indemnify and keep indemnified the Company against all losses, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities incurred by the Company as a result of any claim brought against the Company by any Cardholder, Card Issuer or other third party as a result of:-15.1.1 breach of this Contract by the Merchant; and/or15.1.2 wilful or negligent acts of omissions of the Merchant, its employees, agents or representatives.15.2 The Merchant agrees that as between the Merchant and the Company it is the Merchant’s responsibility to prove to the Company’s satisfaction that the debit of a Card was fully and properly authorised by the Cardholder.15.3 If a claim is brought against the Merchant or against the Company as a result of the activities or actions of the Merchant, by a Cardholder, a Card Issuer, a Card Acquirer, a Card scheme or other third party the Company will be entitled to settle or otherwise deal with it at its absolute discretion, including taking such steps as are reasonable to mitigate any potential loss the Company may incur and the Company shall be entitled to recover all costs of such actions in accordance with Paragraph 15.1.16. Compliance16.1 The Merchant shall ensure compliance with all applicable local laws in the execution and performance of this Contract and without prejudice to the Company’s rights shall immediately bring to the Company’s attention in writing any circumstances that prevent compliance with this Contract.17. Processing Currency17.1 All Transactions are denominated in GBP Sterling and Withdrawals shall be made in GBP Sterling.18. Merchant’s Website(s)18.1 The Merchant agrees to display on the home page and the payment page of its website(s) a logo and link provided by the Company indicating that the Merchant is a client of the Company.18.2 The Merchant hereby agrees to the Company referring to the Merchant as a Nochex Merchant and using the Merchant’s name, website address, logo and trademark in the Company’s promotional material and that of its partners’ promotional material should the Company so wish and in accordance with policies as provided to the Merchant from time to time.18.3 The Company may issue a policy in relation to the Merchant’s obligations under this Paragraph 17. The Merchant shall comply with such policy as if set out herein.19. Limitation of Liability19.1 Except in respect of death or personal injury resulting from its negligence, and subject to Paragraph 19.2, the Company’s cumulative liability for any loss or damage arising with respect to any given Transaction shall be limited to the value of that Transaction less the applicable processing fees payable to the Company under this Contract in respect of that Transaction.19.2 In no circumstances whatsoever shall the Company be liable, in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise for:-19.2.1 losses special to the particular circumstances of the buyer;19.2.2 indirect or consequential losses;19.2.3 recall costs and business disruption or interruption costs;19.2.4 cost incurred in connection with the removal, disposal or storage of defective goods;19.2.5 damage to goodwill or reputation;19.2.6 loss of profits or contribution;19.2.7 wasted expenditure;19.2.8 damage to property; or19.2.9 losses arising from third party claims, resulting from any act or omissions on the Company’s part or any other person authorised by the Company.19.3 Each of the sub-conditions in Paragraph 19.2 are to be regarded as separate and severable Paragraphs.
