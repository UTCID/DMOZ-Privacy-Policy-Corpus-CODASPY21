Home  /  Terms and Policies  /  Unsafe and Poorly Maintained GatesUnsafe and Poorly Maintained GatesIts unwise to pay too much, but its unwise to pay too little.  When you pay to little you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing you bought it to do.  The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot.  It cant be done.  If you deal with the lowest bidder, its well to add something for the risk you run,  And if you do that, you will have enough to pay for something better. John Ruskin
Look at anybodies website or brochure and they will always show you “The Good Stuff”. Good enough?
Scroll through our gallery and witness for yourself the types of equipment that can be purchased for a “Good Deal”.  Then ask yourself, was it such a good deal?
Is the equipment safe and reliable? Does it conform to the latest industry standards?  Why is it less expensive than Newgate equipment?
