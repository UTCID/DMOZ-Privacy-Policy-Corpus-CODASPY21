PIZZA RANCH GIFT CARD TERMS OF USE
You have either purchased or received a Pizza Ranch® Gift Card (a “Card”). The following terms and conditions describe how the Card may be used. By purchasing, accepting or using a Card, you agree to the following terms and conditions. The Card can only be used at participating Pizza Ranch restaurants and for online purchases at pizzaranch.com. Each time the Card is used, the purchase amount will be deducted from the Card’s stored value. If you do not agree with the following terms and conditions, do not purchase, accept or use a Card.
General Terms:
The Card may only be used toward the purchase of Pizza Ranch food or beverage products at participating Pizza Ranch restaurants. This Card, and any remaining balance thereon, may not be redeemed for cash or credit, unless required by law.
Purchasing a Card:
A Card may be purchased at Pizza Ranch restaurant locations, select retail locations and online at pizzaranch.com. If you purchase a Card on pizzaranch.com, the physical card will be mailed via USPS and should arrive in 2-7 business days. If you opt to select FedEx Ground, your order should arrive in 1-5 business days. With FedEx Overnight, your order should arrive the next day. If you purchased an e-gift card, it will be delivered via email in less than 24 hours. If your e-gift card does not arrive in 24 hours, you entered the wrong recipient email address, or you have any issues purchasing a gift card/e-gift card online, call 1-800-321-3401 or email giftcard@pizzaranch.com.
Before Using a Card:
If purchased in-store or at a retail location, keep receipt of purchase. If purchased online, keep order confirmation number or confirmation email.
Redeeming Your Card:
To use your Card, present it to the restaurant guest services staff at time of purchase. If redeeming an e-gift card in-store, the required information needed is the gift card number displayed in the e-gift card email. If ordering carry out or delivery, full gift card number will be required for redemption. If you make a purchase for an amount more than your Card balance, you may use the balance on the Card and then another form of payment for the remaining balance. The Card cannot be used to purchase another gift card.
Viewing Card Balance:
To find your current Card balance, call 1-800-321-3401, visit pizzaranch.com or e-mail giftcard@pizzaranch.com. Your current balance will reflect all transactions that have been posted through our processor.
Replacements:
If your Card is lost, stolen or damaged, it may not be replaced.
Interrupted Card Use:
Occasionally, the Card processing service may experience issues that hinder you from checking or redeeming your balance. Please notify us by calling 1-800-321-3401 or e-mailing giftcard@pizzaranch.com. You agree that Pizza Ranch is not responsible for any delay in balance checks or redemptions.
Fraud:
Pizza Ranch has the right to deactivate or reject Cards sold by unauthorized sellers or Cards involved in fraudulent activity.
Expiration:
Cards do not expire. No inactivity, service or any other fees will be charged.
Ranch Reward Points and Promotions:
At this time, only Cards purchased in-store can earn Ranch Reward points. Cards purchased online, through Great Lakes Scrip and any third-party retailer are not eligible for Ranch Rewards points or for any in-store gift card promotions.
Card for Donations:
Card donations are considered and approved by individual Pizza Ranch locations, not the Pizza Ranch Support Center. If you are looking to get a Card as a donation, contact your local Pizza Ranch.
Updating Gift Card Terms and Conditions:
Pizza Ranch reserves the right to change any terms and conditions upon notice at pizzaranch.com.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
PIZZA RANCH, ITS PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, THIRD PARTY LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS AND/OR THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE CARD PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM PIZZA RANCH, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT THIS CARD IS NON-FUNCTIONAL, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND PIZZA RANCH’S SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CARD. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
