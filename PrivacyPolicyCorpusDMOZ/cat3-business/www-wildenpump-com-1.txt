Taking a look at Wilden’s History – Celebrating over 65 years
Jim Wilden
Jim Wilden pioneered a revolution by inventing the Air-Operated Double-Diaphragm pump 65 years ago. Step back in time with us as we remember Jim Wilden and the legacy he left behind that continues to shape Wilden today.
Wilden Legacy
Wilden 65th Anniversary:
Erik Solfelt Reflects on the Wilden Legacy
Like so many stories of ingenuity, Wilden AODD pumps originated from an idea and a garage. Walk through our history of innovation, beginning with Jim Wilden's invention of the AODD pump, with Product Director Erik Solfelt.
Wilden 65th Anniversary:
Mark McElhenny Reflects on 36 Years with Wilden
Mark McElhenny, Senior Tech Support Specialist, got to work side-by-side with founder Jim Wilden. Listen to the experiences that made McElhenny in awe over Wilden's intelligence and product expertise.
Wilden 65th Anniversary:
Andy Venegas Speaks on the Lasting Legacy of Jim Wilden
Jim Wilden set the standard of quality engineering that continues today. Andy Venegas, Wilden employee since 1991, shared his story on the culture passed down by Wilden to his colleagues and employees.
Greg Dearen
“I saw Jim as an easygoing, caring person but a perfectionist. He cared for the people that worked for him and took care of them. He could also take a joke, or a prank, with a smile.”
Wilden Legacy
