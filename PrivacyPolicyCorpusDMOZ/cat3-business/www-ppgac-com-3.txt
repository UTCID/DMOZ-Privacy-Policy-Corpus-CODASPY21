These entities and brands in the PPG Architectural Coatings family are collectively referred to as "PPG," "We," "Us," or "Our" throughout this policy.
PPG owns and operates a variety of websites (collectively, the "Sites"),
and web and mobile applications (collectively, the "Apps").
PPG is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit and interact with the Sites and/or Apps. As such, PPG's privacy practices are explained in this Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy contains details about how PPG collects and uses information from you when you use the Sites and/or Apps.
This Policy covers the PPG Architectural Coatings family Sites and Apps as described above, and does not apply to information which you may send to us by other means. Other PPG sites, apps and other online locations may have their own privacy policies, and you should consult those accordingly.
If you are within or are a resident of a member nation of the EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (the "EEA," which includes the 27 European Union Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway), Switzerland or the United Kingdom ("UK") (collectively, the "EU"), please review the PPG PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR EUROPE found here to learn about how we collect, share and use your personal data, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.

Standard data and other fees may be charged by your mobile device carrier when using the Apps, or accessing the Sites from a mobile device, so please be aware of them.
By using the Sites and/or Apps, or by choosing to submit or make available personally identifiable or other information to PPG through the Sites and/or Apps, you signify your consent to all of the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with any terms of this Policy, please do not use the Sites or Apps or submit or make available personally identifiable or other information to PPG through the Sites and/or Apps.
1. Changes to this Policy
PPG may make changes to this Policy from time to time, so check back periodically to stay up to date on PPG's data collection, use, and disclosure practices. PPG will indicate when any modifications are made to this Policy on the Sites and Apps, and will indicate at the top of this Policy the date this Policy was last amended. Any changes to this Policy will be posted below for a period of thirty (30) days and will be effective when posted. The changes will also be immediately incorporated into this Policy.
Your continued access to and/or use of the Sites or Apps after any changes are made to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, the Policy as revised. If any of the changes are unacceptable to you, you should cease using the Sites and/or Apps.
If any changes to this Policy affect how PPG treats or handles personally identifiable or other information that you have already provided to or that has otherwise been collected by PPG, PPG will notify you by email (if PPG has a valid email address to use), and/or using other contact information we may have for you, and give you thirty (30) days to opt-in to the changes as they pertain to your information. If you do not opt-in, your information will continue to be used in a manner that is consistent with the version of this Policy under which it was collected, or the information will be deleted.
2. How We Collect and Use Personally Identifiable and Other Information
You can generally visit the Sites and use the Apps without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. Personally identifiable information ("PII") is generally defined as information that may be used to identify you such as, but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, email address, birthday, credit/debit card number, photograph, and age.
There are areas on the Sites and Apps where you may be asked to provide PPG with PII. For example, PII such as name, mailing and/or shipping address(es), email address, telephone number, photographs, credit/debit card number or other financial information, birthday, username and password, and/or office address and other business information, may be collected from you when you:
Sign up or register for a user account on some or all of the Sites and/or Apps;

Order and pay for products and services on or through the Sites or Apps;

The Sites and/or Apps may include the Digital Color Platform ("DCP"), a room color visualization tool that allows you to: (a) use stock photos/images or your own photos/pictures of a room or other area to produce a virtual approximation of how PPG's various paint colors will look when applied to that room/area/location; (b) upload pictures of relevant subject matter to attempt to match the colors in the photo with paint colors offered by PPG; and (c) share photos/images used and produced through the DCP tool with yourself and others by email or social media sharing tools. PPG may need to access your photos, precise location, camera data, Bluetooth technology, and other technology or PII stored on your computer or mobile device through this process. We will request your permission before accessing such technology or PII, but without your permission the DCP may not work properly.
The PII and other information that PPG collects from you may be used by PPG for the purposes for which it was collected, for the reasons outlined in this Policy, and/or for any other purposes that are disclosed to you. PPG may use or disclose your PII and other information to:
Set up and administer user accounts on any of the Sites and/or Apps;
Respond to your questions, inquiries, product reviews;
Compile marketing data;
Supply you with information on PPG's programs or services or the programs and services of our trusted third party associates and affiliates;
Process payments and fulfill orders that you place on or through the Sites or Apps;

By providing to PPG the PII and/or other information referenced in this Policy, you agree that PPG may use the PII and other information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
3. How we Collect Information through Automatic Means
The Sites and Apps may collect information about your browsing history and how you use our Sites or Apps from user devices including IP addresses, generic locations, service providers, time of activity, technology and device identifiers, and tracking pixels/cookies in order to customize user experience, measure effectiveness of communications and Sites/Apps performance, better optimize Sites and Apps performance, and compile market insights. More information on opting out of cookies may be found below. The Sites and Apps may maintain local storage or user activities on the Sites and/or Apps in order to serve recommendations and ease browsing experiences. The Sites and/or Apps may store a user project through a custom URL variable that can be accessed by anyone the URL is shared with by you.
If you choose to log in to any user account for the Sites and/or Apps through Facebook or some other social media service or third party site/service, then PPG may receive information about you or your connections from such site/service.
PPG uses server logs to record page requests. PPG may also store PII and other information on your user devices through local storage. These actions are done to perform some of the actions set above in this Policy.
Third party apps installed on a device may have additional settings enabling the tracking of user activity and geo-location. Additionally, device settings may enable the sharing of user information. PPG does not own the data collected on these devices but may use it when using third party services for the purposes of advertising, improving digital experience, performance measurement and gathering market data. You should consult those third party apps and/or your device's privacy settings for more details on how to opt-out of geo-location tracking.
4. Third Party Service Providers
PPG may use third party service providers to analyze how users move around the Sites and/or Apps to help provide you with a more streamlined web experience, and provide you with more relevant data. These third party service providers may collect and aggregate tracking information such as the browser and/or internet service provider you use, which pages and advertisements you view, demographic data, hardware/software type, and date/time. This information does not identify you personally and is not combined with any PII you may provide, such as your email address. Third party service providers may include and are not limited to:
Google Privacy Policy – https://policies.google.com/privacy
Google Analytics Privacy Policy – https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en

5. Online Behavioral Advertising
PPG may use third party service providers to provide you with more relevant data, including advertising based on your perceived interests on our and third party sites and platforms.
You can opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising/targeted ads ("IBA") served by us or on our behalf by clicking on the blue triangle Ad Choices icon in the upper right corner of the ads we serve or by clicking to http://youradchoices.com. If you opt-out, you will still see ads, but they will not be personalized based on your browsing history. If you delete your cookies or upgrade your browser after opting out, you will need to opt-out again. Further, if you use multiple browsers or devices, you will need to execute this opt-out on each browser or device. If you come across one of our ads that you believe was delivered based on your browsing habits (on any of the Sites and/or Apps), and you have a problem with opting out of such targeted ads, please contact us at contact@ppgac.com.
You can also opt-out of receiving IBA from certain third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by clicking here. We also comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You may opt out of receiving IBA from other companies that perform targeted advertising services, including some that we may work with, via the DAA site http://www.aboutads.info/.
The industry opt-out tools described above only function for users of the Sites. If you use the Apps and would like to opt-out of receiving IBA while using the Apps, you must download and make choices through the DAA's free mobile application AppChoices for each device you use (more info available at https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). You may also consult the settings on your mobile device for further options regarding cross-app advertising.
Please note that when using the ad industry opt-out tools described above, you may need to execute the opt-out on each browser or device that you use, and that other companies' opt-outs may function differently than our opt-out.
PPG may engage in cross-device tracking when using customer relationship management ("CRM") software. PPG engages in cross-device tracking to determine whether the same user/person is using more than one device, such as a mobile phone and computer. This allows PPG to combine that user/person's overall use of the Sites and/or Apps to better serve targeted advertisements. Please contact us at contact@ppgac.com for details on how to opt-out of that tracking on a specific device. If PPG engages in this type of tracking, you will need to opt-out on a device-by-device basis.
6. How We Disclose/Share PII and Other Information
Except as noted herein, PPG does not sell or share your PII with any person or entity outside of PPG. PPG may share your PII and other information among the Sites and Apps covered by this Policy. Unless otherwise stated in this Policy, PPG does not share PII with any other parties, including affiliates and related companies, for direct marketing purposes. The Sites and/or Apps may integrate with social media services which will let you share actions you take on our Sites and/or Apps with other apps, sites, locations, or media, and vice versa. Please review the privacy policies of those social media services for more information about how such services handle the information you provide to or share through them. PPG may share PII and other information with its vendors and other third party service providers that assist PPG with making the Sites, Apps, and related services function properly or to deliver targeted experiences, or which otherwise assist us with carrying out the purposes described in this Policy. This may include, but is not limited to, sharing PII and information with:
PayPal (when you make a purchase through the Sites and/or Apps);
data processing contractors to send you information on PPG's behalf;
media agencies executing communications on PPG's behalf;
advertising platforms utilized to target PPG's audience;
email vendors to send you information on PPG's behalf;
survey and market research to gain market intelligence;
shipping entities (e.g., Federal Express, postal services) to ship to you products and other materials on PPG's behalf; and/or
back-up data storage providers so that copies of data can be recovered if PPG's computer systems were ever damaged, destroyed, or inaccessible.
PPG may share your PII and other information with a third party (and its attorneys, accountants and other relevant parties) in the event that PPG merges with, acquires, is acquired by, or becomes a legal affiliate with, such third party, or should such a transaction be proposed.
PPG may also disclose your PII and other information to third parties if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law or that disclosing such information is necessary to: (i) conduct investigations of possible breaches of law; (ii) identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating an agreement they have with PPG; or (iii) to avoid imminent physical harm to any person or to protect PPG's rights, safety or property. PPG may also disclose your PII for any other purpose to which you consent.
PPG may also use and disclose your PII to relevant third parties (e.g., forensics investigators, attorneys, law enforcement) to investigate, respond to, and/or to prevent a security/data breach, or to cooperate with government or law enforcement authorities pursuant to other legal matters.
If you are not a California resident, PPG may also disclose your PII to third parties who are providers of goods or services when you consent to or request such sharing.
Other than what is referenced above, the PII and other data collected from you is not shared with nor sold to any person or entity outside of PPG.
7. Cookies and Related Technologies
The Sites may use "cookies," which are small pieces of information that a site stores on a user's/visitor's web browser or computer that may be used to store/remember user preferences, save data, track a user's online activity, and/or remind the site about the user/visitor the next time he/she visits the site. The cookies may also allow PPG to customize your experiences on the Sites and gather information about your navigation of the Sites.
PPG uses browser cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, and social media/network plug-ins. Certain vendors may place and read cookies on the Sites to help PPG deliver marketing messages on the Sites and on other online locations you visit after you leave the Sites.
You may be able to manage how some cookies are used. Most browsers can be set to notify you when a browser cookie is being placed on your computer. You can manually delete browser cookies and set most browsers to refuse to accept browser cookies, although doing so may affect your website experience. Flash cookies may be removed by managing your Flash Player settings with Adobe. To delete or prevent placement of Flash cookies, you will need to visit the Adobe Flash Player Help site at http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/, click on the hyperlink for "Website Privacy Settings Panel" on the left hand side of the screen, and follow the instructions for preventing third-party Flash content from storing data on your computer.
Browser Cookies: Browser cookies are used by PPG and third parties we work with for targeted marketing activities and web site analytics. Browser cookies are placed on PPG Sites by PPG as well as third parties. The information that PPG collects and shares does not contain PII such as customer or consumer names, addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses.
Flash Cookies: PPG uses Flash cookies on certain PPG Sites for purposes such as map functionality and animations, but does not collect PII through this process.
Tracking Pixels: PPG uses tracking pixels to help manage online advertising and Sites traffic analysis. These image files are provided by third parties for external ad management, search marketing tracking, affiliate marketing, and etrade.com site analytics. In all such instances, the pixel is programmed to collect your computer's IP Address and certain other limited information when you are on our Sites. PPG does not collect your name, e-mail address, or telephone numbers using this technology. For example, with online advertising campaigns, pixels enable third parties to recognize a cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring unique users to PPG Sites from other locations on the internet.
Opt-Out of Cookies
You have choices about whether certain information collected on websites, including PPG Sites, is used to customize advertising based on predictions generated from your visits over time and across different websites.
Please keep in mind that refusing cookies may affect your experience on PPG Sites.
Browser Cookies: For these cookies, you may delete or prevent placement of cookies by following the instructions contained in the help section of your browser. For certain browser cookies that target advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and opt out of the behavioral advertising delivered by the NAI's member companies.
Flash Cookies: To delete or prevent placement of Flash cookies, you will need to visit the Adobe Flash Player Help site at http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/, click on the hyperlink for "Website Privacy Settings panel" on the left hand side of the screen, and follow the instructions for preventing third-party Flash content from storing data on your computer.
Web Beacons/Tracking Pixels: Because web beacons or clear gifs are included within the recipe for a web page (just the same as any other content request), you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, where they are used in conjunction with cookies, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser. In other instances, such as in the case of emails, clear gifs are not used in conjunction with cookies and if you are unhappy with the use of clear gifs in such manner, then you should not use the Sites or register to receive emails.
8. External Links
While on the Sites or Apps, you may choose to follow links to other external online locations, including those embedded in third party ads or sponsor information, which are not controlled by PPG. Be aware that other online locations may collect and use PII differently than PPG on the Sites and Apps, and operate in accordance with their own privacy policies. PPG is not responsible for the privacy practices and data collection policies/practices of such third party locations. You should consult the privacy policies of those respective third party locations for details before using them.
PPG may also allow interaction between the Sites and/or Apps, and other sites or mobile applications such as Facebook or other social media providers. This may include the "Like" button or other plugins available through the Sites or Apps that allow you to share information with persons outside of the Sites or Apps. Please consult the privacy policies of those third party providers before using them to make sure you are comfortable with the level of sharing.
9. Children's Privacy
The Sites and Apps are intended for individuals 18 years of age and older located in the United States and Canada.
The Sites and Apps are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 13 years of age. PPG does not knowingly collect or use information, including PII, on children under the age of 13. If PPG becomes aware of any information collected from a child under the age of 13 through the Sites or Apps, PPG will delete the information.
PPG will not use a minor's PII to market or advertise certain products or services deemed harmful to children. PPG also will not disclose any minor's PII if it has actual knowledge that the minor's PII will be used for the purpose of marketing or advertising the harmful products or services.
10. Geographic Restrictions
The Sites and Apps are meant for individuals within the United States and Canada. PPG only knowingly collects information from individuals within the United States and Canada. If you provide information to PPG from outside of the United States and Canada, you do so at your own risk. If you are outside of the United States and Canada, you are responsible for complying with any local laws regarding use of the Sites and Apps, and related data collection. You also agree and acknowledge that by providing any information, including PII, through the Sites or Apps, that such information may be transmitted to, and stored in, the United States.
11. How We Handle "Do Not Track" and Similar Requests/Signals
PPG does not independently act on browser "do not track" or similar requests.
If third parties are able to directly collect information through the Sites or Apps, it is possible that some of these third parties may respond differently than PPG to browser "do not track" requests. You should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information.
12. How We Protect Personally Identifiable Information
PPG takes reasonable steps to protect data against unauthorized access.
The security of your PII is important to PPG. PPG protects PII by using, implementing, and maintaining industry standard physical, organizational and technological safeguards and security measures that are reasonably designed (appropriate to the sensitivity of such PII) to help protect against loss, and unauthorized use, disclosure or access, of PII in both storage/rest and in transmission. PPG requires complex passwords for user accounts through the Sites and/or Apps.
Unless otherwise stated elsewhere in this Policy, PII may only be accessed by persons within PPG's organization, or by PPG's third party service providers who require such access to provide you with the services indicated above, or to carry out such purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. The PII that PPG collects is transferred to, and stored and maintained in, the United States. We manage the personal information we collect from our offices located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania; Longueuil, Quebec; Toronto, Ontario.
PPG retains collected PII only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements. PPG will also retain collected PII connected to business records for periods of time required by law. PPG will destroy collected PII when PPG determines it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected. PPG's collection times will be consistent with applicable law.
Although PPG has taken reasonable and prudent measures to protect its Sites, Apps, computer systems and any collected PII from unauthorized use, access, disclosure, misuse, alteration or destruction, no security measures can provide absolute protection. As a result, while PPG is committed to protecting your PII, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit to or through the Sites or Apps. PPG cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information sent over the Internet, as transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches PPG. If you are concerned about sending information to PPG over the Internet, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements. PPG is not responsible for the security of information sent over the Internet.
Some or all of the PII that PPG collects may be stored or processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction of residence, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.
13. Access and Review of Collected Information/Your Choices
If you would like to review, edit or request the deletion of any of the PII that PPG has collected from you, or wish to request a correction to it if you believe it is inaccurate, please contact PPG at contact@ppgac.com or use the contact form on any of the Sites and/or Apps. PPG will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request, but PPG cannot guarantee it will be able to remove all PII from the specified uses and/or grant you full access to the same PII (e.g., if the PII contains personal information of other persons, or for other legal reasons). Therefore, please be as specific as possible in your request. If the request relates to information that PPG needs to make the Sites or Apps function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Sites or Apps properly going forward. In such cases, PPG will try to provide you with a reasonable explanation of why it is not possible to remove or grant you access to your PII. PPG may require you to verify your identity before providing you with access to your PII/personal information.
PPG reserves the right to maintain proper business records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate purposes permitted by law, even if such records contain your PII.
If you would like to opt-out of receiving further promotional emails from PPG, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send PPG a detailed email to contact@ppgac.com.
PPG does not knowingly collect any information from minors, nor are the Sites or Apps directed at or intended for minors. If a minor uploads/posts information to the Sites or Apps that is publically available, and the minor subsequently wants that same information deleted, the minor has a right to request that such information be removed from public viewing by contacting PPG at contact@ppgac.com. Any removal of content by PPG does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places. The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal, state, or provincial/territorial law may require maintenance of the content or information.
14. Terms of Use

SERVICES COLOR DISCLAIMER

If this TOU or your permission to use the Services (or any feature or portion thereof) is terminated by us for any reason, the agreement formed by your acceptance of this TOU will nevertheless continue to apply and be binding upon you in respect of your prior use of the Services and anything relating to or arising from such use.

When you log back into your User Account or otherwise use the Services after that notification is made, you will be prompted again to review the new TOU and agree to it. If you do not agree to the revised TOU, you are no longer authorized to use the Services. Where required by applicable law, we will provide you advance notice at least 30 days before the amendment comes into effect by posting the amended TOU on this page, and where applicable, by sending you notice using any contact information that may be available to us and setting out the new clause, or the amended clause and how it read formerly, and the date on which the change will come into effect. We will indicate at the top of this page the date this TOU was last revised. You may refuse the amendment and rescind, or cancel your participation in the Services without cost, penalty or cancellation indemnity, by sending us notice to that effect no later than thirty (30) days after the amendment comes into force, using the information in the notice. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, your continued access to and/or use of any Services after the date specified in such notice constitutes your full acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, the terms of this TOU, as revised.
