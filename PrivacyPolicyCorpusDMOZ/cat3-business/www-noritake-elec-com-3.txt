GT Series Long Term Support Policy
We have more than 40 years of experience in supplying our Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) and its related products. Through our experience, we are very aware of how important long-term support is for our customers and continue to strive to maintain strong supply chains with our VFD and GT products. Our main concern when talking about long term supply is components going obsolete.
If a component becomes obsolete, the following actions will be taken to support our customers:
We will find the most compatible replacement component possible.
If a compatible component is not available, we will modify the affected product’s PCB layout to apply an equivalent component.
If an equivalent component is not available, we will consider redesigning the affected product while maintaining a platform as close as possible to the original product.
If the future demand for a certain product is low, we will announce the End of Life (EOL) for that product and recommend an appropriate replacement product.
If you have any questions or requests, feel free to contact us at any time.
