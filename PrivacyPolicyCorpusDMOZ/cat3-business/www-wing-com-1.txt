Effective September 2019
Thank you for participating in Wing’s drone delivery Service. The Service is provided by Wing Aviation LLC located in Palo Alto, CA (“Wing” or “we”). The Service uses unmanned aerial vehicles (“drones”) to deliver parcels, food and other products (“Products”) carried or sold by our merchant partners to you through our Wing mobile application (the “Service”).
When we say “Service Terms,” we mean these Service Terms and Conditions.
You represent that you are at least eighteen years old and capable of entering into a legally binding agreement on behalf of yourself.
By clicking the “I agree” button in the Wing delivery app (“App”) or Wing Form, you agree to these Service Terms.
1. Termination.  Participation in the Service is entirely optional, and you may end your participation at any time by deleting the App or by contacting Wing at support@wing.com. Wing may terminate the Service or your participation in the Service at any time for any reason with or without notice to you. Upon termination by either party, these Service Terms will terminate, except that certain provisions of the Service Terms will continue to apply after termination as set forth in the “Survivability” section herein.
2. Drone Safety.  You agree to clear your delivery location of any obstacles prior to delivery. During delivery, the drone will hover approximately 20 feet above the ground, and the package will be lowered to the ground by a tether. Please stay at least 6 feet from the drone and delivery area during delivery and do not touch the package until it is released from the drone and the drone is clear of the area.  Drones have moving parts, including propellers, that can be dangerous if you come into contact with the drone while in operation. You agree to abide by all safety instructions, rules, and requirements provided by Wing to you and you acknowledge that you are aware of potential risks and consent to operation of the delivery drone near you.
3. Communicating with Wing.  So that we can keep you updated on the progress of your delivery or of the Service generally, we may need to get in touch from time to time. Wing (or its contractors) may contact you (by text, phone call, email, in-person visit, etc.) in connection with the Service or as otherwise described in our privacy policy. You may contact the Wing team at support@wing.com at any time with any questions that you might have.
4. Access.  To make a delivery, Wing drones will need access to your property or the property designated in your order. You expressly provide permission for Wing drones to overfly and hover over your property to make a delivery. Wing personnel and/or its contractors may need to access your property from time to time to conduct the Service. We will contact you in advance if our personnel or contractors require access to your property, and of course, you may decline.
5. Our Warranties and Disclaimers.  We conduct the Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care. OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE SERVICE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 10, WING EXCLUDES ALL WARRANTIES IN RELATION TO THE SERVICE AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
6. Service Privacy Statement.  We take your privacy very seriously. Information about you that we collect in connection with provision of the Service (such as, for example, name, email address, telephone number, address, information about your property, and Product order details) is handled  in accordance with the Wing Privacy Policy and these Service Terms.
7. Deliveries of Products Ordered via Wing App.  Through the App, you will be able to order and purchase Products offered by our merchant partners. The Products are sold directly by the merchants.  We reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order or reject all or any part of an order without prior notice. If we accept your order, we will then deliver the Products to you by drone. All Products displayed on the App are subject to availability. If you have food allergies or other questions about a Product, please contact the selling merchant directly to determine whether a Product is suitable for you. Wing does not prepare or take responsibility for any Products sold by our merchant partners.
a. System Availability. Delivery times may vary and the system may be down at certain times. We may be unable to accept or deliver an order due to App availability, availability of delivery drones or other reasons. Subject to section 10 of these Service Terms, any estimated arrival or delivery time provided by Wing is not guaranteed; and we make no representations or warranties regarding availability.
b. Return and Refund Policy.  If you are not satisfied with your delivery experience, please contact us at Wing. Return and refund policies with respect to Products are determined by the selling merchants. If you would like more information about a merchant’s return and refund policy, please contact the merchant or visit their website. You may contact Wing or the selling merchant directly if you wish to initiate a return of or refund for a Product.
c. Product Prices and Related Fees.  Product prices and applicable fees (such as taxes and other fees that the merchant charges, like bottle deposits and e-waste fees) may vary and will be displayed to you (subject to paragraph f below) in the checkout process in the App.  Product prices are set by the selling merchants and do not include delivery fees.
d. Delivery Fees.  Delivery fees are set by Wing and will be displayed to you during the checkout process in the App.
e. Payment.  By providing a credit card (or other payment method accepted by the App), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us, the selling merchant, and our third-party payment processor to charge your payment method for the total amount of your order (including any applicable taxes and other charges) and the delivery fee(s).  If the payment method you provide cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your order. In the event you want to change or update payment information associated with your account, you can do so at any time by logging into your account and editing your payment information.
f. Title, Estimated and Final Sales Taxes.  Sales through the App are online sales and are processed as online transactions. You will receive an electronic receipt for your order. Wing does not take title for any Products you order through the App. Rather, title for each Product you purchase will pass directly from the merchant to you upon delivery of the Product to you. Sales tax will be calculated at the time title passes to you.  The App may display estimated taxes on your purchase to you online during the purchase process; however, your final receipt will display the final sales tax calculated. Each merchant is solely responsible for calculating and informing Wing how much sales tax to collect on each order.
g. Product Warranties.
THE PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THE APP ARE SOLD AND DELIVERED TO YOU “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS”. WING DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR PROMISES ABOUT THE PRODUCTS OR THE DELIVERY.

16. Severability.  If any part of the Service Terms becomes illegal, invalid, unenforceable, or prohibited in any respect under any applicable law or regulation, such provision or part thereof will be deemed to not form part of the contract between us.
