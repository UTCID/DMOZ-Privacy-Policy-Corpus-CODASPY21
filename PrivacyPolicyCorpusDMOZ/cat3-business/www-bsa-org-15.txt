Securing 5G: A Call to Harness Software Innovation
Governments across the globe are racing to develop and deploy 5G technologies because of the enormous potential of 5G networks to transform businesses and individual lives. 5G networks will bring quantum leaps in speed, latency reduction, and flexibility that enable a wide range of new applications. In particular, 5G will support massive expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is expected to grow to more than 200 billion devices by 2023. Together, these technologies will fundamentally reshape the global economy, improve the quality of life for billions of individuals, reshape the digital ecosystem, and transform how humans interact with the physical world.
