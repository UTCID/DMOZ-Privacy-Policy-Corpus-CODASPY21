For more information, please call us at 1-800-408-5657.QuestionWhy is it illegal to train with an online preview?AnswerIn the training industry we don't actually sell videos, we sell a "license to train", with a particular medium. When we offer a potential customer a free online "preview-only" for purchase evaluation only, it is  "unlicensed". Therefore, it is illegal to use the preview-only video for training. Training industry videos and all written materials are protected by U.S. and international copyright laws.QuestionWhat is the penalty for making an illegal copy of a video?AnswerThe Copyright Act allows a copyright owner to recover monetary damages measured either by: (1) actual damages plus any additional profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement, or (2) statutory damages, of up to $150,000 for each copyrighted work infringed.
The copyright owner also has the right to permanently enjoin an infringer from engaging in further infringing activities and may be awarded costs and attorneys' fees. The law also permits destruction or other reasonable disposition of all infringing copies and devices by which infringing copies have been made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights. In cases of willful infringement, criminal penalties may also be assessed.Signing-Up on Our WebsiteQuestionWhy should I sign up for Media Partners website?AnswerMost people first sign up for our site in order to watch the full-length previews online. If you sign up for the Media Partners website, you will have access to full-length previews to choose the program that will be the right fit for your training plans.
