Privacy Policy
IIDM is committed to protecting your personal information. We set out below the following important information concerning your privacy:
Collection of Your Personal Information
When you register as a member of IIDM, we will collect details such as your name, organisation, email, job description (and related information). Some of that information is necessary for us to be able to accurately identify the users of our website. Other types of information enable us to profile the users of our particular service. Where designated, information of this type is optional - you do not need to fill it in if you don't wish to.
When you pay for goods or services online using a credit card or PayPal, we collect some additional necessary information, including billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. We process your credit card details securely over the Internet using an accredited internet payment security system.
We confirm that IIDM respects the necessity of confidentiality and security of information provided to it by its members and takes reasonable precautions to protect that information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. However, we refer you to the section headed "Security of Your Personal Information" below relating to the security limitations applicable to online transactions.
Use of Your Personal Information
The personal information that you provide to us during registration is used for identification purposes and will assist you using various other services on our website.

IIDM also recommends that its members use the various Links carefully.
