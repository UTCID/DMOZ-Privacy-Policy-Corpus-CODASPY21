Linking Policy
An outbound link is an URL (such as http://www.vanik.com) pointing to a foreign web-site/web-page. Concerned link is considered an inbound link for the foreign web-site.
So, if web-site http://www.abcd.com places a link http://www.xyz.com in one of its pages, then the link will be considered outbound link for web-site www.abcd.com and an inbound link for web-site www.xyz.com
In this age of search engine marketing, in-bound link has become extremely important for success of any web-site. vanik and its sister portals enjoy very high ranking and Page Rank among leading search engines such as Yahoo!, Google, Alta Vista, AlltheWeb, MSN etc. This has been achieved through painstaking promotion work since 1997.
We allow members to place a link in their profiles - pointing to their web-sites. This outbound link from our portals vastly improves quality of communication between member and potential customer as well as improves search engine rank of concerned member's web-site.
However, such link policy also leaves our portals vulnerable for abuse. This is no idle thinking, vanik and its sister portals have been abused by mischievous outbound links several times - forcing us to rethink our linking strategy.
By placing an outbound link from our portal to member's web-site, we not only help members in sales negotiation but also considerably help his/her web-site in getting high search engine ranking.
Unlike our competitors who do not allow any outbound link from their portals other than to web-sites designed by them - we have been offering this service to members.
In view of changed circumstances - we are now formulating following linking policy. All outbound links from vanik.com, vanik.com and thegreatindianbazaar.com
Should be functional - i.e. clicking at the link should bring some web-page - not 'error 404', 'under construction' or such message
Should not redirect to a third party web-site
Should point to domain name owned by member (e.g. www.yourcompany.com) - not web-page hosted on third party (e.g. www.abcdtrade.com/yourcompany/)
Should not point to web-sites dealing with objectionable or offensive content such adult materials, sex, crime, violence, hacking, spamming etc. Our decision as to what constitutes an 'objectionable/offensive' material in this respect will be final.
Should not point to web-sites banned by any leading search engine such as Google, Yahoo!, AltaVista, MSN, AOL, AllTheWeb etc.
Members in Member Premium and above levels can place outbound link from vanik.com. The link must strictly adhere to above guidelines.
Members in Basic and Plus level should follow reciprocal link arrangement where they can also place outbound link from www.vanik.com following above guidelines. As per reciprocal link arrangement - we would expect them to place an outbound link from their homepage to www.vanik.com.
Vanik reserves the right to terminate membership/subscription or any other contract for any reason whatsoever. Termination notice will be provided via e-mail and will be effective immediately. If any member/ subscriber or visitor attempts to defraud the system or fellow members/ subscribers - such member's or subscriber's rights/provileges will be revoked as determined solely by Vanik.
