Tips for Grant Seekers
Zions Bank only reviews one request per nonprofit per year. The fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31.
If the request is for an event (e.g. gala, race, golf tournament) nonprofits should apply at least 60 days in advance.  This provides Zions Bank with sufficient time to process the check, fill the table(s), and provide the nonprofit with any additional items, such as sponsorship benefits.
Event requests should also include a list of the different donation levels with the corresponding sponsorship benefits in their application.
approved applicants
We believe that giving local employees the authority to determine donation distributions creates value for communities.
application process
Nonprofits will receive an email or phone call from their Regional Giving Committee President regarding the status of their request. If approved funding, nonprofits must submit a/an:
Invoice
W-9
Charitable Contribution Acknowledgement Form
