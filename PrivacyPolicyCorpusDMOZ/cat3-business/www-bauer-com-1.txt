PRIVACY POLICY

BODY MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY
BAUER offers measuring tools that can help you find your product size. These tools are available through the Apple Store or Google Play as downloadable mobile applications or can be accessed through our website at www.bauer.com. Our measurement tools provide users the option to either manually enter body measurements or to have a photograph taken of your clothed body that is processed, programmatically, by the mobile measurement application and used to determine products that best fit your body profile.
Body Measurement Photographs
You control how and when the photographs are taken. You agree that any photograph you provide shall not be pornographic, lewd or otherwise offensive to members of Bauer and we reserve the right to refuse access to our mobile services to any user who provides such photographs or videos. Our systems automatically delete photographs related to measurements once they are processed. Photographs are protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Bauer's body measurement technology.
