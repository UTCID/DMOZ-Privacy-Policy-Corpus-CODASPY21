These Terms of Use (“Terms”) set forth the basic terms and conditions that govern use of the Site. Read them carefully, as your use of the Site constitutes your consent to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site.
Modification. We reserve the right to change, edit, delete, or revise these Terms at any time, and such changes will be effectively immediately. Notification of changes or modifications will be made by posting the modified Terms of Use on the Site and indicating at the top of the Terms of Use the date on which it was last updated. Use of the Site after a change has been posted constitutes acceptance of and consent to the amended Terms of Use.
Privacy. For information on how NoIR collects, uses, and discloses information from its users, review our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
Site Contents. The text, images, graphics, video files and their arrangement on the Site are all subject to copyright and other intellectual property protection. These objects may not be copied for commercial use or distribution, nor may these objects be modified or reposted to other sites. Access to and use of the Site is solely for personal, non-commercial use. No right, title or interest in any of the contents of the Site is transferred as a result of any downloading, copying, printing or use of the Site.

Nothing in these Terms shall constitute a waiver of any trademark or other intellectual property rights concerning a name, logo, or trademark.
Links to Other Websites. The Site may include links to other sites on the World Wide Web, the Internet, or other sources of information. The use of third party websites is entirely at your own risk. By accessing these links, you acknowledge and agree that NoIR shall not be responsible for any information or additional links found at such site or location, or for your use of such information. Outside links are provided only as a courtesy, and NoIR has not endorsed, tested or verified any information or programs found at such sites.
