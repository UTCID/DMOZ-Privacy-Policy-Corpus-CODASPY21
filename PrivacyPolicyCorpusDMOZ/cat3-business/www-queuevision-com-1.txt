Private Policy
Computer Blue Technologies, (LLC) the parent company of Queue Vision Streaming Service values customer privacy. This Privacy Policy was designed in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.
We will collect and use personal information only when necessary, solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes described by the current Terms of Service and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law. Queue Vision provides services to a general audience not intended for use by children. Thus, when using any of our services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. However, for persons under 13 years of age parental permission is required to give personal information to Queue Vision.
At the time of collecting any personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
For example, information that personally identifies you that we collect include:
information such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, that you provide by completing forms on the sites, including if you register as a user of the services, subscribe to our mailing lists, upload or submit any material through the services, or request any information;your log-in and password details in connection with the account sign-in process;details of any requests or transactions made by you through the service; andcommunications you send to us, for example, to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns, or comments regarding the Service or its content;
We will use this information that personally identifies you to:
identify you when you sign-in to your account;enable us to provide you with the services or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information);administer your account with us;enable us to contact you regarding any question you make through the service; anduse for other purposes that we may disclose to you when we request your information.
In addition, we automatically receive and store certain types of technical and non-personal information whenever you interact with our products and services. This helps us enhance your experience, but this information does not identify you personally — you remain anonymous.
Examples of such information we may collect include your IP address, cookie information, device hardware information, browser type and language, system type, whether you have enabling software to access certain features, referring website URLs, and other information about your interactions with us. This information helps us keep you logged in, remember your preferences, confirm delivery of email communications, and generally observe how people are using our products and services.
We may use a variety of methods to collect this information, including cookies, pixel tags or other methods. We don’t use cookies to create a unique profile of you or to collect personal information from you. We don’t track your information across the Internet.
The information we gather enables us to provide you with our products and services and to help administer your account. You consent to our use of your information to do any of the following:
Enable you to use and navigate our products, services, features and other activities;Enhance, customize and personalize your Queue Vision experiences and communications; andOperate, provide, improve and maintain our products and services, including analyzing anonymous user behavior.
We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as a local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.
We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes prescribed by law.  Otherwise, after a maximum of 10 days we may start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating portions of your personal information, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week.
Finally, we can’t guarantee that messages and corresponding metadata will be deleted within a specific timeframe. Keep in mind that we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law. This is true even after we’ve deleted messages and corresponding metadata from our servers. We also sometimes receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information. Finally, of course, as with any digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.
We will protect personal information by security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.  Please note, however, that regardless of these industry-leading efforts, we cannot 100% guarantee the security or confidentiality of the information you provide to us over the Internet or through electronic storage. We are not responsible for the actions of others or the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures. If we discover a security breach that compromises your personal information, we will inform you in accordance with applicable law.
We collect and use limited data with Google Analytics, which then self-destructs after 10 seconds. Our backend logs the total number transactions started, number of messages sent, beta-list sign-ups, and incoming requests.
We do not and will never view, log, or transfer plaintext versions of your encrypted data, nor the private keys and mutually shared secrets needed in order to decipher them.
We have not been approached by any agency, government or otherwise, with a request to backdoor our code. We are currently working on implementing a better warrant canary system.
We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.
However, please note that we may disclose information we have collected when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our employees, affiliates, users or others, and defend ourselves against third-party claims. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may also disclose information upon governmental request or in response to a court order.
Third-party vendors (i.e. Google, TV Streaming, etc.) may collect personal information and data upon your use of Queue Vision’s services in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to laws governing privacy and data protection. Third-party vendors may also use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website or other websites. The third-party vendors’ use of advertising cookies enables them and their partners to serve ads to you based on your visits to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet. For Google you may opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings. (Alternatively, you can opt-out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting www.aboutads.info).
Note as a general matter Queue Vision does not opt-out of third-party ad serving. Thus, the cookies of Google, as well as other third-party vendors or ad networks, may also be used to serve ads on the Queue Vision site. Further, note that you may visit the websites of Google as well as the other third-party vendors to opt-out of the use of cookies for personalized advertising (if the Google or the vendor or ad network offers this capability). Alternatively, you can opt-out of some third-party vendors’ uses of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting www.aboutads.info.

support@queuevision.com. If Queue Vision becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, Queue Vision will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.
