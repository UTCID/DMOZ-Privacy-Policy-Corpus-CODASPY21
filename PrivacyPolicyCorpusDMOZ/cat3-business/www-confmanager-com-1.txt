The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postal or zip code).

We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.

Security
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
We protect personal information and the user's right to privacy by:
Only collecting personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy statement.
Ensuring appropriate security measures are in place.
Ensuring appropriate confidentiality measures are in place for personal information when dealing with third party.
Ensuring that personal information is kept up-to-date and current for the purposes in which it is being used.
Honouring any user request for access to their personal information.
When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk, account manager or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. As well any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. Our servers are located in a access-controlled facility in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The servers are physically secured within a locked cabinet within the facility to ensure no unauthorized physical access.
If users have any questions about the security at our Website, users can send an email to support@confmanager.com.
Supplementation of Information
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.
Credit Card
We do not conduct credit card validation as all credit card processing for our products and services is undertaken by Bambora Inc. or the appropriate payment processor.
ID Verification
In order to ensure the integrity of our business clients, we conduct a reverse phone number lookup to verify a business user's identity.
Purchasing History
We do not combine information about the purchasing habits of our users with other third parties.
Enhancement of Marketing Profile
We currently purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in.
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating/Transferring Personal Information
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as name, postal code, zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update, or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the going to the profile page or by emailing our Customer Support at support@confmanager.com. If a user wishes, a digital copy of their information may also be provided by contacting the support email. Please allow upwards of 30 days to complete the request, though in most instances we are able to fulfill the request much more readily.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy statement and or practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. The posting of changes to the privacy statement shall be effective within 30 days.
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
