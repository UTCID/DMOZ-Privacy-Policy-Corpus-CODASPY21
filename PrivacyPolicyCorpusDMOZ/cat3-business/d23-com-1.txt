What is D23?
D23 is “The Official Disney Fan Club” — established on March 10, 2009, as the first-ever “official” club of its kind in the history of The Walt Disney Company. From beloved Disney Parks to the legendary Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disney has built a rich legacy on imagination and creativity, but would be nowhere without its passionate fans.
D23 was established to bring Disney fans closer to the “magic” through one-of-a-kind experiences, special events, unique merchandise offerings, quarterly publications, exclusive online content, and opportunities to meet others who share the same affection for Disney. D23 offers fans an insider look at every corner of Disney, from the parks, animation, television and film to the treasures of the legendary Walt Disney Archives.
What does D23 stand for?
The “D” stands for Disney, and “23” represents 1923, the year that Walt Disney arrived in California and founded what was to ultimately become The Walt Disney Company.
Is D23 on social media?
Yes! For breaking news and all things Disney, follow DisneyD23 on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.
Make sure to also update your account preferences on Facebook and YouTube to ensure that you get all the latest Disney news from D23! Step by step instructions are available here.
