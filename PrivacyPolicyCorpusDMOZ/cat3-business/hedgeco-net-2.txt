Non-Personal Information
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Site.
This information includes the type of Internet browser and operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the URL that you visited before you came to our Site, the URL to which you next go, and your IP (Internet Protocol) address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Site. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our Site design and functionality. When you use the contact features of
the Site, you consent to the review and internal use of your communication by HedgeCo. We also may use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage and to gather broad demographic information.
Cookies
Like most major websites, HedgeCo uses cookies on our Site.
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while visiting a Site.
Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you.
For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities on our Site, and which allows you to enter your password/log in ID less frequently while visiting our Site.
Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information although cookies may enable us to relate your use of our
Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted.
For example, it enables us to enhance personalization on the Site, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. We will always give you the choice of opting out of receiving a cookie by checking the appropriate box.
However, if you decide to opt out, your use of the Site may be slowed because you will have to enter your log in ID and password at every session.
