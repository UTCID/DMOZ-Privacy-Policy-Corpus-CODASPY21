A data leak is the result of a security problem. In most cases, this relates to leaked computer files, although a stolen printed customer list can also form a data leak. Other examples: cyber attacks, e-mail sent to incorrect addresses, stolen laptops, discarded but not erased computers and lost USB sticks. Illegally obtained business information about a production process or market strategy is valuable information, but does not fall under the usual definition of a data leak. If a company telephone is lost or stolen, that is a potential data leak. There is no data leak if a private telephone is lost (the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data for exclusively personal or domestic purposes).IntroductionThis document describes the actions to be carried out by TEBV in case of a data leak as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).A data leak is a security breach involving personal data. The personal data are then exposed to loss or unlawful processing.A data leak must be reported immediately to the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and, in certain cases, also to the involved party or parties. The involved party is the party whose personal data is leaked.The reporting obligation also applies to TEBV if the data leak occurs at a third party’s location, for example, a processor of personal data from TEBV (‘Processor’).Identification of a data leak: organisationThe employee that identifies a (possible) data leak must report this incident immediately to the Board of TEBV and to the TEBV data protection officer (DPO).> A TEBV employee or a Processor is authorised at all times to submit a report independently to the DPO The data leak notification requirement as described in this protocol will then be started.When must a data leak be reported?Not all incidents must be reported to the DPA. Only incidents that meet the following criteria must be reported:an incident for which there is a ‘considerable chance’ of serious negative consequences for the people whose data is lost;an incident that can have serious consequences for the protection of personal data (for example, the loss of a USB stick with personal data).More information on whether a data leak must be reported to the DPA and/or involved party or parties is described in greater detail below.Identification of an incident/has a data leak occurred?The DPO will arrange as quickly as possible the inventory and collection of the information that is required to report a data leak to the DPA (if applicable). The form from the DPA can serve as the basis for reporting data leaks. The form is available on this website.Based on the information obtained and in the event of a suspected data leak, in consultation between the business director and chairman of the board, the DPO and any other responsible and/or involved persons in the TEBV organisation or the relevant Processor, an assessment will be made of whether a data leak has actually occurred.During that consultation, an assessment can also be made of whether immediate measures must be taken to limit the damage as much as possible, including submitting a (provisional) report to the involved parties. If required, advice can be requested from the legal advisor and/or the communications consultant, if present.In case of an incident that must be reported to the DPA, the overview in the policy rules ‘Data leak notification requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation’ of the DPA must be used, which can be found at this website.During the assessment of whether a data leak has occurred, the following factors are relevant:has personal data been unlawfully processed?this refers, among other things, to the unintentional or illegal destruction, loss or changing of processed personal data or unauthorised access to processed personal data or the unauthorised disclosure of that data;has personal data been lost?this means TEBV (or, in fact, its Processor) no longer has this information, because it has been destroyed or has in some other way been lost;is there a single deficiency or vulnerability in the protection?can it be reasonably ruled out that a security breach has led to unlawful processing?have personal data of a sensitive nature been leaked?sensitive personal data includes among other things (i) information regarding the involved party’s financial or economic situation, (ii) information that can lead to stigmatisation or exclusion of the involved party, (iii) user names, passwords and other login data and (iv) information that can be used for (identity) fraud;do the nature and scope of the breach lead to (a considerable chance) of serious negative consequences?during the assessment of whether this situation applies, the following factors, among others, are significant: (i) the scope of the processing, (ii) the question of whether the breach involves a large amount of personal data per person and/or the data of large groups of involved parties, (iii) the impact of loss or unlawful processing of personal data, (iv) the sharing of the personal data with third parties as a result of which the consequences of loss and unauthorised change of personal data can also have an impact elsewhere and (v) involvement of vulnerable groups.If the incident has not led to loss or wrongful processing of personal data, this is not a data leak, but rather a security breach. In that case, reporting to the DPA is not necessary.If the conclusion is reached that a (potential) data leak has occurred, the communication pathway towards the involved party or parties and (if applicable) the relevant Processor will be discussed between the board of TEBV and the DPO.Reporting to the Data Protection AuthorityThe board of TEBV or the DPO handles the prompt reporting to the DPA in accordance with the above-mentioned DPA reporting form. Pursuant to the GDPR, the notification must be submitted immediately, without undue delay, and if possible no later than 72 hours after the discovery of the data leak. The Board will also be informed of the notification.The Board of TEBV (or, upon request from the board, the DPO) functions as the contact person with respect to the communication with the DPA. Depending on the nature of the data leak or if it turns out that the incident is not a data leak, the notification to the DPA will be supplemented or withdrawn.The Board or (upon request from the board) the DPO will ensure that the employees involved in the incident are informed and will ask the employees involved in the incident to prepare a report as soon as possible on the circumstances of the incident. This written information will be submitted to the board and the DPO to be added to the TEBV’s data leak file.Following receipt of the notification to the DPA, the DPA will send a confirmation. The DPA will only contact you if it sees reason to do so.Has the system been hacked?In case of a data leak as a result of an (unethical) hack (Article 138ab Dutch Penal Code), it is important to determine what the nature of the leaked personal data is and what the risks of misuse are for the involved party or parties. In case of a hack, in addition to the notification to the DPA, it can also be worthwhile to report the hack to police. In that case, the DPO will ensure consultation with the board of TEBV.Must the data leak be reported to the involved party or parties? If a data leak is reported to the DPA, it must be determined whether the data leak must also be reported to the parties to whom this personal data relates. The board will determine that in consultation with the DPO.The assessment of whether an incident must be reported to the involved parties can be established using the overviews in the ‘Data leak notification requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation’ policy rules of the DPA, which can be found at the website mentioned above.As part of the consideration of whether the data leak must be reported to the involved parties, the following points, among others, are of importance:if TEBV has taken suitable technical protective measures, as a result of which the personal data to which this relates is incomprehensible or inaccessible to everyone that has a right to view the information, the involved party or parties do not need to be notified. In case of doubt, the data leak must be reported to the involved party or parties;the data leak must be reported to the involved party or parties if the infringement is likely to have unfavourable consequences for their privacy;The interests of the involved party or parties can be harmed as a result of loss, wrongful use or misuse of personal data. The damage can be of a material or immaterial nature, for example, unlawful publication, defamation of character, identity fraud or discrimination;The involved party or parties need not be informed if there are significant reasons for this. Notification can only be omitted if this is necessary in consideration of (i) the security of the state, (ii) the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, (iii) substantial economic and financial interests of the state and other public bodies, (iv) supervision of compliance with the legal provisions that are set on behalf of the interests as specified under (ii) and (iii), or (v) the protection of the involved party or of the rights and freedoms of others).Procedure for notifying involved party or partiesOn assignment from the board of TEBV, the DPO will prepare a notification for the involved party or parties in consultation with the communications advisor and legal advisor. The DPO determines what will be reported to the involved party or parties.The notification contains, in any event, the nature of the infringement, contact details for TEBV and a contact person or information point where the involved party or parties can find more information about the infringement and the measures that TEBV recommends involved party or parties to take to limit the negative consequences of the infringement.The data leak must be reported immediately to the involved party or parties. This means that, after discovery of the data leak, TEBV can take some time for further investigation so that TEBV can inform the involved party in a proper and careful manner. When doing this, consideration should be given to the (possible) fact that, as a result of the notifications, the involved party or parties must possibly take measures to protect against the consequences of the data leak.
