PRIVACY POLICY
We consider respecting our customer’s privacy as one of our most significant responsibilities. We created the following privacy policy guidelines with a fundamental respect of your right to privacy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us by email at info@srirecords.com.
How We Gather Information
We only collect the information you voluntarily give us when you place an order. At this time we do NOT put “cookies” on your browser. We do NOT track what other sites you visit. Your web activities are confidential to you and we respect your privacy. During the ordering process, customers are required to give their contact information (such as name, address and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user to notify them of sales and special offers.
How We Use Information Surveys & Contests
From time to time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information may include contact information (such as name, address and e-mail address), demographic information (such as age level, zip code) or interest category (such as travel, sports). This information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving satisfaction to the users of the goods and services being offered.
The Use Of Cookies
At this time, we do NOT use “cookies” to collect personal information and we do NOT use cookies to retrieve information from your computer for purposes that are unrelated to the website or your interaction with the website.
Security
We utilize the latest server technology to house our database. To protect our database we use a complex system of backups and firewall technology. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure datacenter.
