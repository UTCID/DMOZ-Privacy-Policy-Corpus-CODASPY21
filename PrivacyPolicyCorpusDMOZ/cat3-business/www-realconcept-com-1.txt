Our Commitment To Privacy:
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and
used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on most
pages of our site and at every point where personally identifiable
information may be requested.
The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
RealConcept.com website. On some pages, you can order products, make
requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal
information collected at these pages are:
Name
Address
Email address
Phone number
On the secure access page we collect the IP number of the computer
you are using to identify the computer being used to ensure that no one
is using another person's name or pretending to be someone else.
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order
only to complete that order. We do not share this information with
outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an
order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share
this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
complete that order.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such
addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with
outside parties.
You can register with our website if you would like to receive our
newsletter as well as the full range of member's discounts and services.
Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose
unless you fill out the registration form.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our
website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an
advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our
website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used
to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information
provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above
without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security:
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information:
You can request all your personally identifiable information that we
collect online and maintain by contacting us. We use this procedure to
better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps
to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
