Who we are
Our website address is: https://kindredrecords.com.
What personal data we collect and why we collect it
We do not sell, loan, or give personal data from our site visitors to any third parties.
Our security plugin logs site visitors by IP address and records pages visited. This enables us to detect potential hackers and spammers, if needed, but gives us no personal data about our visitors aside from the country of the IP address.
If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we ask only for your name and e-mail address, and you have the option to unsubscribe at any time.
If you post a comment to one of our articles, or to our contact us form, we collect your IP address, and whatever name and e-mail address you submit to the form, as well as whatever comment or message you leave.
If you order services from our site, we collect only such information as is necessary to process your order. We do not collect or store credit card data. Paypal handles our online transactions, so the only information we have in our database is your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone, the data needed to send your order or to contact you should we have questions or problems with shipping.
