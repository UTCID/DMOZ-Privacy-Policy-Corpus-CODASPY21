"Our Commitment To Privacy"
Your privacy is important to Martco Inc. To better protect
your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information
practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is
collected and used.
By participating in the Council of Better Business
Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the
program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and
have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is
available at
www.bbbonline.org
All BBBOnLine Privacy Program participants are required to
work with the program's dispute resolution process. The Privacy Program will
only accept complaints regarding the misuse of personally identifiable
information by a website operator. For more information about the Privacy
Program dispute resolution process visit
www.bbbonline.org/privacy/dr.asp
The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
Martco Inc website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests,
and register to receive materials. The types of personal information
collected at these pages can include:
-Name
-
Address
-Email Address
-Phone Number
Credit/Debit Card Information
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order
only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside
parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. (for example,
a dropship)
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order
only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this
information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete
that order.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. From time
to time, Martco Inc. sends out information on specials. If you do not wish
to receive these, you can email us at
orders@martcoinc.com.
Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with
outside parties.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.  We utilize SSL encrypted data transmission
technology.
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is
protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks
users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that
information is encrypted and protected. While on a secure page, such as our
order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing".
How To Contact Us
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy
policies, or to review or correct your contact information with us please
call us at 800-333-7769 or send us an email at
orders@martcoinc.com. To protect your privacy and security, we will also
take reasonable steps to verify your identity  before granting access or
making corrections.
