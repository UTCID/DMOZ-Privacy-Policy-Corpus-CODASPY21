Privacy Policy
This policy was last modified August, 2016
If you apply to use our services, you entrust us with some personal information about yourself. At Fremont Bank, we recognize and respect the personal privacy of our customers. Therefore, we want you to know about the policies and procedures that we have developed to help protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information about consumers who are customers of Fremont Bank. Our privacy policy applies to our traditional banking customers who use services provided in person, at our branches or by telephone, and to our customers that use our online services, provided through a personal computer, tablet, or mobile device via the Internet.
Our Privacy Policy is set out below and in the attached Privacy Notice. It is current as of the date above. Our Privacy Policy, like the other policies at our Bank, is used by us as a guideline and a business-planning tool. It is not a contract or standard that we are obligated to follow in all cases or in all manners, and we may change it in accordance with our internal policy-setting procedures, from time to time. If you would like to verify that this is or is not a current version of our Privacy Policy, please contact us at (800) 359-BANK (2265) or by e-mail to compliance@fremontbank.com.
What Kind of Information is Collected about You?
At Fremont Bank, we collect most of our information directly from you. How much we collect depends on you.
If you are a visitor at one of our branches, no information is collected about you unless you make a request that requires us to obtain information (such as, you ask that something be sent to you or that you want a telephone call from us) or you otherwise provide the information to us. If you are a visitor to our website, www.fremontbank.com, our Web server automatically recognizes your Internet Service Provider’s domain name and aggregates information about what pages are visited. We use this information to improve the content of our Web pages and to better target our online advertising. But unless you make a request when you visit our Web pages, we do not collect e-mail addresses or postal addresses, or telephone numbers, to contact visitors.
If you are, or become, a customer of Fremont Bank, nonpublic personal information about you is collected from the following sources:
From you on applications or other forms (such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income);
From your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others (such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit usage); and
From consumer reporting agencies (such as your creditworthiness and credit history) or other third parties.
What We do With Information About You
In most cases, any nonpublic personal information about you that we collect is used by us in our efforts to serve your financial needs and administer your personal accounts and transactions. All nonpublic personal information collected and retained by Fremont Bank is used for specific business purposes. Thus, we may use the information to protect and administer your personal accounts and transactions, to comply with state and federal banking regulations, to help improve or design our products and services, or for similar purposes.
Disclosure of Information to Others With limited exceptions, we do not currently sell or share personally identifiable information about you with others. If we change this policy, we will let you know beforehand and give you an opportunity to "opt out." As exceptions to this policy, we may from time to time provide personally identifiable information about you to others:
To help assure the accuracy and security of the information. For example, we may provide information to consumer reporting agencies.
In connection with the acquisition or sale of loans, or all or a portion of our business, or other businesses.
In connection with inquiries made by merchants or others, where the other party represents to us that the inquiry is made as a result of a transaction with you. For example, merchants will from time to time ask us to verify the status of a check you have given them.
As part of our marketing of our financial products or services. We may, for example, use another party to mail materials to you, or to help us identify products and services we offer that may appeal to you.
As part of any legal or regulatory requirements imposed on us.
Our "Privacy Notice" includes further information on the circumstances where we disclose information to others. As a general rule, we do not share information with others under programs where the other person will use the information to market their products or services to you. If we decide to change this policy, we will inform you of the change and give you an opportunity to prevent the sharing by "opting out."
California Financial Privacy Act
In accordance with the California Financial Information Privacy Act ("Division 1.4") we will not share information we collect about you with companies outside of our corporate family, except as permitted by law, including, for example, we may share information with your consent or to service your account.
Maintenance of Accurate Information
We will do our best to keep the information collected complete, current and accurate. When customers notify us that the information is inaccurate, we will research the matter and make any necessary corrections.
Employee and Vendor Access to Information
Only authorized Fremont Bank employees and vendors who have a legitimate business need to know the information are authorized to access personally identifiable information. Each employee and vendor has responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information, and take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee responsibility.
The Bank is selective in choosing the companies with which we have these arrangements. We share information about you only to the extent that they need the information to fulfill the purpose of their contracts with us. We require them to comply with strict standards of security and confidentiality, and they are not permitted to release, use or transfer customer information to non-affiliated third parties for their own purposes.
Privacy Principles for Customers
Fremont Bank is committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers’ personal information. Customers who are concerned about financial privacy and want to tell us not to call or send direct mail for additional products or services, or want to know more about this important issue may contact their Fremont Bank representative, or write us at 2580 Shea Center Dr., Livermore CA 94551 (Attn: Compliance Director), call us at (800) 359-BANK (2265) or click here to manage your communication preferences.
Please note that if you make this choice, we will still call you and send you mail to service your existing relationships, or provide account related information (and, when doing so, the mail we send may include pre-printed marketing materials in those mailings).
Protecting Children’s Privacy Online
From our web sites, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without containing verifiable consent from their parents.

We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated third parties to which our web sites may link.

Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice contains important privacy information. It forms a part of our Privacy Policy, a copy of which is available at any branch, on our web site which is shown above, or by calling (800) 359-BANK (2265). This Privacy Notice describes how we may now or may in the future handle nonpublic personal information about you as our customer. We may amend (add to, delete or change) these terms, with such prior notice as is required by law.
Security Statement
Fremont Bank’s Online Banking service requires the use of an Access ID and a password. To deter attempts at unauthorized access, the system will lock out the account after three unsuccessful tries. It is your responsibility to keep your password, user access identification number, account numbers, and other personal information confidential. Here are some tips on how to do this.
Do not reveal your password to anyone and do not write it down. You can use a secure password manager to keep track of passwords. Fremont Bank will NEVER ask for your online banking password.
Change your password regularly. Choose a long password, such as two words separated by a number or punctuation.
Do not leave your computer unattended while you are logged in and sign off and close the web browser or web application when you are finished with your session.
In addition, you should run up to date anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall software. Often, all of these are available within a single commercial product. Always install security updates when you are prompted by your system.
If possible, use a single, trusted computer to perform online banking, and don’t use that computer for any other Internet activity.
Our web site digital certificate issued from a Certificate Authority (CA) validates the identity of the Bank to your web browser, which ensures that you are communicating with Fremont Bank’s web site and not an imposter. While using online banking all communications are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which requires that you use a web browser with at least 2048 bit (4096 is highly recommended) encryption. Most modern web browsers support this.
