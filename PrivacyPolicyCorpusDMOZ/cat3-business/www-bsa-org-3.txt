Policy Issues
Artificial Intelligence
Software innovation is fostering the development of a range of cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to improve daily lives and transform businesses. BSA provides input to policymakers as they consider public policy issues implicated by the deployment of these new technologies. BSA generally supports a streamlined policy approach that promotes the development and adoption of cutting-edge technologies and analytics tools associated with emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and blockchain.
Artificial Intelligence
Businesses of all sizes in every sector of the economy can benefit from the smart use of AI. AI solutions are already leading to improvements in healthcare, advances in education, more robust accessibility tools, stronger cybersecurity, and increased business productivity and competitiveness. AI also has the potential to generate substantial economic growth and enable governments to provide better and more responsive citizen services while addressing some of their most pressing societal challenges.
BSA AI Policy Overview, May 2018.
A flexible policy framework that can adapt to the diverse range of AI use cases is necessary to enable the responsible deployment of AI products and services while allowing for future advances. BSA has identified five key pillars for facilitating responsible AI innovation:
Building Confidence and Trust in AI Systems
AI can do great things, but we recognize that it must be developed and deployed responsibly. That means being responsible stewards of customer data; explaining how AI systems work; and using AI to reduce bias in decision making and increase inclusion. BSA members recognize the importance of raising awareness of and building confidence in AI systems and will continue to be leaders in creating best practices surrounding the development and deployment of fair, explainable, and accountable AI technologies.

Sound Data Innovation Policy
The exponential increase in data, combined with increases in remote computing power and development of more sophisticated algorithms, has fueled advances in machine learning and AI. Capitalizing on these capabilities to facilitate the development of AI requires sound data innovation policies that (1) ensure data can move freely across borders, (2) guarantee open access to government data, (3) facilitate the development of value-added data services, and (4) maintain predictable, technology-neutral competition policies.

Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection
As AI and other digital technologies increasingly create a globally connected economy, we must also be vigilant in addressing increased security and privacy risks. BSA advocates for policies that encourage the adoption of enhanced security measures and respect informed consumer choices while ensuring the ability to deliver valuable tailored products and services. BSA’s cybersecurity agenda identifies five key principles for effective cybersecurity and BSA’s global privacy best practices identifies fifteen best practices for data protection, which apply to AI innovation.

Research and Development
Investment in education, research, and technological development will be integral to continued development of AI technologies and global economic growth. These efforts should include consistent public sector investment, particularly in projects focused on basic, long-term research, as well as investments in workforce training and development.
Workforce Development
The increasing use of and demand for technology is changing the distribution of jobs and the nature of work. Developments in AI are creating new types of jobs, in every sector of the economy, that require an evolving set of skills. And mid-career employees are increasingly expected to interact with technology that did not exist when they entered the workforce. This trend will continue in virtually every industry. The public and private sectors, as well as academia, have important roles to play in developing solutions that will prepare the next generation for the jobs of the future and allow the current workforce to transition successfully to the new job environment. BSA members are deeply committed to tackling this challenge with stakeholders across sectors.
