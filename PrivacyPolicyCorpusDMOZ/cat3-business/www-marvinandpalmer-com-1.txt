A separate form of consent will be needed to set up a delegation of authority.
4.  Limits on Collection, Use and Disclosure:
We limit our collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information to what is necessary to run our business and to deliver superior service.
In General.

To do these things we may share Personal Information with service providers, such as accountants, lawyers, trustees, custodians and registered agents, which may be based anywhere in the world. Information will be used only for the purposes for which it is disclosed and will be retained by those service providers, and by us, for as long as may be necessary to fulfill these purposes or for a longer time if required by applicable law.
