ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW
In the event of a dispute between You and GLOBALTRAVEL.COM, You and GLOBALTRAVEL.COM agree that a prompt and fair resolution, without the time and expense of formal court proceedings, would be in both parties’ mutual interests. Except as expressly provided in the following section titled “Injunctive Relief”, all disputes shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration to be conducted in Orange County, Florida, or a location closest to Orange County, Florida if no such location for the chosen arbitration body exists there. MANDATORY ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT OF EITHER PARTY TO GO TO COURT AND DEMAND A JURY TRIAL. The party filing the arbitration must choose one of the following three arbitration firms and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and pursuing an arbitration:
American Arbitration Association, 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New York, NY 10017-4605 (phone: 800-778-7879) (http://www.adr.org)
National Arbitration Forum, P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405-0191 (phone: 800-474-2371) (http://www.arb-forum.com)
JAMS, 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614 (phone: 949-224-1810) (http://www.jamsadr.com)
In the event that the selected firm cannot administer the arbitration, the party filing the arbitration will select another of the firms. Each party will bear its own expenses, and the parties will share equally the filing and other fees of the arbitration firm and the expenses of the arbitrator, except that the arbitrator will be entitled to award a different allocation of costs and fees where the arbitrator determines that a filed claim is frivolous.
The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive damages or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute. Any award in arbitration initiated under this clause will be limited to monetary damages and will include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount, except as required by statute or to comply with the terms of the contract. Any award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding upon each of the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
During the pending of such arbitration and until final judgment thereon has been entered, these Terms will remain in full force and effect unless otherwise terminated as provided hereunder. If a provision of this clause is held to be invalid, the remainder of the clause will remain in full force and effect, and, to this end, the provisions of this clause are severable.
These Terms and all transactions between you and GLOBALTRAVEL.COM shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
You acknowledge that a violation, attempted violation, or threatened violation of any of these Terms will cause such damage to GLOBALTRAVEL.COM as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, you agree that GLOBALTRAVEL.COM shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining such violation or attempted violation of these Terms by you, as well as recover from you any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by GLOBALTRAVEL.COM in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees. You agree that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction.
For purposes of this Section, you agree that any action or proceeding with regard to such injunction restraining such violation, attempted violation, or threatened violation shall be brought in the courts of record of Orange County, Florida, or the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida. You consent to the jurisdiction of such court and waive any objection to the laying of the venue of any such action or proceeding in such court. You agree that service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable laws, rules of procedure or local rules.
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
If any portion of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, these Terms as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of these Terms that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from these Terms.
The headings contained in these Terms are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of these Terms, and shall not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in these Terms, as may be amended by GLOBALTRAVEL.COM from time to time, shall survive your acceptance of these Terms and the termination of these Terms.
These Terms represent the entire understanding and agreement between you and GLOBALTRAVEL.COM regarding the subject matter of these Terms, and supersedes all other previous agreements, understandings and/or representations regarding the same.
