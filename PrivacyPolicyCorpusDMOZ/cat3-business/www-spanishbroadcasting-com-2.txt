In the event that SBS offers downloads of software on its Sites and you download such software, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generate by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the “Software”) are licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your personal, non-commercial home use only.   We do not transfer title to the Software to you.   You may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form.

SBS DOES NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS AND, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, SHOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT THERE IS AN IMPLIED CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND SBS.
SBS’s long-standing company policy is not to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions.   Accordingly, please do not distribute Unsolicited Submissions on or through any SBS Sites.   SBS wants to be certain to avoid any possible confusion or misunderstanding when projects developed by it, or under its direction, might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.   We, therefore, implore that you do not submit any Unsolicited Submissions.   Nonetheless, you agree that any Submission you make is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and SBS, in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type.
To the extent that any of SBS Sites offer a public forum (i.e., an area, site or feature which permit users to distribute Submissions for viewing by one or more SBS Site Users, including a chat area, message board, instant messaging, mobile messaging, social community environment, profile page, conversation page, blog, e-mail and the like) (hereinafter, “Public Forum”), you acknowledge that the Public Forum and any related features are for public and not private communications, and that you have no expectation of privacy with regard to any Submission to a Public Forum.   You further understand that SBS cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose, and that all disclosures are made at your own risk.
Content posted on our Sites by our users is not guaranteed by us as to accuracy, completeness, or usefulness, and we do not endorse any content posted by our users.  It is the responsibility of our Site users to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any content posted on our Sites by other users.   SBS does not have a duty to monitor any Public Forum.   Consequently, you should be skeptical about information provided by others, and you acknowledge that the use of any Submission posted in any Public Forum is at your own risk.   SBS is not responsible for and does not endorse the opinions, advice or recommendation(s) posted or sent by other users in any Public Forum, and expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection therewith.
You are and shall remain solely responsible for the Submissions you post on or through any SBS Site and for the consequences of submitting and posting the same.
You agree not to upload, post or otherwise make available on our Site any material protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of the copyright, trademark or other proprietary right. You agree and acknowledge that you have the burden of determining whether any material is or is not protected by copyright. By submitting material, you grant (or warrant that the owner of such material has expressly granted) to us the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute such material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such material. You also permit any other user of the Site to access, view, store or reproduce the material for that user’s personal use. You grant us the right to edit, copy, publish and distribute any material you make available to us. You will indemnify us for, from and against all claims, losses, costs and expenses resulting from the content and information you supply.
You may not post or otherwise make available on our Site any content that is illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, or otherwise injurious to third parties. You may not impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of your content. Further, you may not make use of our services to forge e-mail headers, or send bulk unsolicited e-mail messages. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content posted on our Site to determine compliance with our Terms of Service and/or to satisfy any law, regulation or government request. We have the right, in our sole discretion, to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on our Site including, but not limited to, material that is unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, graphic, or otherwise objectionable.

SBS does not warrant or guarantee the availability, completeness, correctness, accuracy, usefulness, timeliness or reliability of, or the results of your use of or reliance upon, any information or material contained in such third party sites.  You acknowledge that your access and use of such third party sites is solely at your own risk, and that since the sites are not controlled by use, different terms of use and privacy policy may apply.   SBS does not endorse and cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from any third-party site that link to or from SBS Sites or third-party content contained on SBS Sites.  Under no circumstances will SBS be liable in any way for any information or material contained in any third party sites linked to or from its Sites. SBS is not responsible for any errors or omissions therein, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your use of or reliance upon any information or material contained in such third party sites.
