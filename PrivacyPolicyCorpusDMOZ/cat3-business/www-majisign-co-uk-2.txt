Data Privacy Policy
MAJIsign Limited holds personal information about our clients, employees and suppliers, so we are legally obliged to protect that information under the Data Protection Act.
The Act aims to promote high standards in the handling of personal information and so protect the individual’s right to privacy. The Act applies to MAJIsign Limited since we hold information about living individuals in electronic format and, in some cases, on paper.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
We will collect and process the following information about you:
Information you give us
This is information about you that you give us when you browse or use the site, correspond with us by phone, SMS, email, social media or otherwise. It includes information you provide when:
You register to use our site
Search for a product
Place an order on our site
Participate in discussion boards or other social media functions on our site
Enter a competition
When you report a problem with our site
The information you give us includes your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information, photographs, videos, images or comments.
Information we collect about you
With regards to each of your visits to our site we will automatically collect the following information:
Technical information, including the IP address used to connect your computer or device to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, anonymised location data, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;
Information about your visit, including the full URL, clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time), pages or products you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page.
We follow the eight data protection principles of good information handling.
These say that personal information must be:
fairly and lawfully processed;
processed for specified purposes;
adequate, relevant and not excessive;
accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date;
not kept for longer than is necessary;
processed in line with the rights of the individual;
kept secure; and
not transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area unless the information is adequately protected.
What sort of personal information is covered by the Act?
Broadly, the Act covers any information that relates to living individuals which is held on computer. For example, this may include information such as name, address, date of birth and opinions about the individual or any other information from which the individual can be identified.
What sort of processing is covered by the Act?
Broadly, the processing of personal information includes obtaining, disclosing, recording, holding, using, erasing or destroying personal information. The definition is very wide and will cover virtually any action which is carried out on computer.
Why does MAJIsign Limited comply with the Act?
First, because it’s a legal requirement. However, it also makes good business sense.
For example:
Keeping the information we have about you secure will help protect our information.
We want to contact you using the most appropriate method using the most accurate information.
Good information handling is at the core of our business practices
GDPR Update
The 1998 Act will be superseded by the new Data Protection Act 2018 (as supplemented by the GDPR) on 25 May 2018.
MAJISign’s direct marketing involves the processing of personal data and therefore we must comply with the principles set out in the DPA.
The first principle
We must process personal data fairly and lawfully. In particular, we will usually need to tell you that we plan to use your details for our marketing purposes. We will also need to tell you if we plan to pass your details on to anyone else  (we will likely need your consent to do so) and our policy in to not pass on any information held. We will not do anything that you would not reasonably expect or which would cause them unjustified harm.
The second principle
We must only collect personal data for specified purposes and cannot later decide to use it for other ‘incompatible’ purposes. So, we cannot use your details for marketing purposes we they originally collected them for an entirely different purpose.
The third principle
The data we collect and process must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.
This means:
We do not hold any more data than it is required
We don’t collect additional data if we don’t need it for processing
We know how the data is used in order to ensure data minimisation
The fourth principle
We must ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. So, a marketing list which is out of date, or which does not accurately record people’s marketing preferences, could breach the DPA.
Section 11 of the DPA also gives you the right to prevent your personal data being processed for direct marketing. You can, at any time, give written notice to stop (or not to begin) us using your details for direct marketing.
By using this site, you may supply us with personal data.
The fifth principle
Personal data should be kept only for as long as necessary. Aligned to our data retention schedule, we regularly delete data that we no longer require. Generally, due to the financial nature of the majority of our records, our retention period is 7 years from the cease of the contract; which could be from the last purchase or closure of a contractual business relationship.
The sixth principle
The last principle requires data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. We secure your data through effective paper management and by using secure platforms for our digital data. We utilise services from Microsoft to provide compliance and governance reports based upon our communications data and artefact storage.

Who do we share it with?
We do not share your data with any third parties except as provided in this policy or as required by law. We will not share personal data with third parties for direct marketing by those parties without your consent.
To ensure that your payment details are not being used without your consent, we will validate your name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases.
By providing your payment details to us, you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks, personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered credit reference agency which may keep a record of that information. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. During the security checks we may ask for additional information or documentation to help support the data which you have supplied.
How long we keep it
We are required under UK tax law to keep your basic personal data (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of 6 years + current after which time it will be destroyed. Any information that you consented to being used for marketing purposes will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive this information.
Majisign Ltd may also disclose your personal information:
We may provide aggregated statistics (including information derived from your data) about our sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to trustworthy third parties. We will do this for the purpose of carrying out assessments, analysis and research in relation to our business, products, services and customers. This is to assist in the provision of services and products to you, and to facilitate reviews, developments and improvements to our web site and the services and products offered to you. The statistics we disclose to those third parties will not include personally identifying information.
We may provide information to the police, regulators, law enforcement or other government agency where the law requires this, where appropriate to prevent or detect criminal activity.
