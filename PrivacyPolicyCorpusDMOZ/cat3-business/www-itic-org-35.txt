Internet of Things
Go Back
We live in a world where physical objects in the industrial, mobile, and home domains are increasingly being transformed from isolated systems to networked Internet-enabled devices that can communicate with each other and the cloud. This is called the Internet of Things (IoT). As more and more of these “intelligent” connected inputs, companies are creating new types of revolutionary applications and services in sectors ranging from manufacturing to utilities, smart building to smart home, transportation to health care, and retail to agriculture. This development has the potential to transform previously standalone systems into integrated networks that leverage greater computer capabilities and data analytics to increase efficiencies and productivity, address important societal challenges, and create jobs in a global new economy which is expected to grow to more than $2 trillion by 2025.
IoT Security
The benefits that IoT brings do not come without possible downsides. To minimize the potentially significant risks posed by malicious actors seeking to exploit them, these devices need to be secure and resilient.
To address these concerns, ITI created the IoT Security Policy Principles—a guide intended to help policymakers and stakeholders better ensure the security of the IoT ecosystem.
Smart Cities
Smart cities will be the epicenter for a multitude of IoT applications and use cases, including intelligent transportation, smart buildings, improved government services, and more. While these use cases initially will be vertical sector-specific, ultimately cities will become horizontal IoT platforms where individual use cases can fluidly interconnect to maximize efficiency, productivity, and citizen ease-of-use.
