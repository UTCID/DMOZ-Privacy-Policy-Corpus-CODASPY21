When you request one of our web pages through your browser, data such as:
your IP address
your browser and the version you’re using

the date and time and the site you came from
…are stored in a log file and/or a database.
But don’t worry – this information can’t be used to identify specific individuals, and we only use it for:

anonymous user analysis, so we can see how our site’s being used
Use of cookies
Our website automatically deploys a cookie on your computer when you arrive (provided cookies aren’t blocked by your browser).
This little chap allows us to track visitor statistics and usage of the site and is automatically deleted after 30 days.
On 27th May 2011, those lovely people at the EC introduced a directive called the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation 2011 which requires owners of websites to get specific approval from the visitor if cookies are deployed.
It’s pretty easy to restrict or block the cookies used on our site through your browser settings. If you go to the Help function within your browser, you can get detailed instructions on how to change them.
If you’re really interested, you might also want to visit www.aboutcookies.org, which provides instructions on how to block cookies on all the major browsers. This splendid site also explains how you can delete cookies that have already been stored on your computer as well as general information about cookies. Have fun!
You should be aware though that most cookies are harmless and restricting them may actually impact on the functionality of the websites you visit.
