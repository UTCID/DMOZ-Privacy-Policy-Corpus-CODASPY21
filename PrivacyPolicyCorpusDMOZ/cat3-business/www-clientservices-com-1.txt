9. Choice of Law
This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Missouri, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
10. Agreement to Arbitrate
(a) Arbitration
To the extent feasible, the Parties desire to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of or access of the Site, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitration (a “Dispute”) through discussions and negotiations between each other. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other Party (by phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If, after good faith discussions, a Dispute(s) cannot be resolved solely between the Parties, such Dispute(s) will be determined by arbitration in St. Charles County, Missouri before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This provision will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. This Section 10 will survive termination of this Agreement.
(b) Conduct of Arbitration
The arbitration will be commenced by the claimant party filing a demand for arbitration with the administrator of AAA and serving the demand on the opposing party. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the demand for arbitration is filed, the Parties will select an arbitrator by following the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules’ appointment procedures. Except as may be required by law, neither Party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration under this Agreement without the prior written consent of both Parties. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing accompanied by a reasoned opinion and a written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
(c) Costs
The arbitrator will determine how the costs and expenses of the arbitration will be allocated between the Parties, and may award attorneys’ fees.
(d) Limitation of Liability
In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect, or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits or any punitive or exemplary damages.
(e) Arbitration is on an Individual Basis Only; Class Action Waiver
The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that this Agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitrator’s power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction and the validity or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate, the arbitrator has no power to rule on the validity or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate solely on an individual basis. In the event the prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of this Section 10 will remain in force.
11. Jurisdiction
The Site and the Services are directed to those individuals and entities located in the United States. We do not direct our Services to any person or entity in any jurisdiction where (by reason of nationality, residence, citizenship, or otherwise) the publication or availability of the Site, its content, and the Services are unavailable or otherwise contrary to local laws or regulations. If this applies to you, you are not authorized to access or use the Services, or any related content. CSI makes no representation that the information or content on the Services is appropriate or that the Services are available outside of the United States. Those who choose to access or use the Services from other locations do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
12. No Professional Advice
The information available on the Services is intended to be a general information resource regarding the matters covered, and is not tailored to your specific circumstance. It is not professional advice, and should not be construed as such.
13. Miscellaneous Terms

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CSI relating to your use of, and access to, the Services and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations.  This Agreement may not be amended except as set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement.  For avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding this Section 13(a), this Agreement does not modify, revise, or amend the terms of any other agreements you may have with CSI.
(b) Construction
If any portion of this Agreement is ruled invalid or otherwise unenforceable, it shall be deemed amended in order to achieve as closely as possible the same effect as originally drafted.  Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to as much of this Agreement as possible.
(c) Headings
Descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of this Agreement.
(d) No Waivers
Our failure to enforce or exercise any provision of this Agreement or related right will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
(e) No Assignments and Transfers
No rights or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by you, either voluntarily or by operation of law, without our express written consent and in our sole discretion.
(f) Language of this Agreement
Although this Agreement may be translated into other languages, the English language version of this Agreement shall control in any dispute between the parties.
(g) No Third Party Beneficiaries
Nothing in this Agreement will confer upon any person, other than the parties, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities whatsoever.
(h) Notices
You can provide any notices to us under this Agreement by e-mail or mail using the contact information provided in Section 14.  Unless you tell us otherwise, or the law requires otherwise, you agree to receive all communications from us by e-mail or through posting notices to your account.
