Court of Protection

Home › Your Life › Court of Protection
Sadly there are times in people’s lives when they no longer have the mental capacity to deal with their own affairs and require the support of others to act on their behalf. This may be due to age-related illness or an accident.
Once it becomes apparent that someone will require assistance in managing their affairs we will meet with that person and family members to discuss more fully how we can provide assistance.
If there is a Lasting Power of Attorney or Enduring Power of Attorney in place we will seek to register that with the Court of Protection providing the necessary medical evidence.
If there is no Power of Attorney in place then it will be necessary to apply to the Office of the Public Guardian for a Deputy to be appointed for that person. Once the application is made, the Court will consider the medical evidence and the appropriateness of the proposed Deputy and, if happy, will make an Order appointing the Deputy. The Deputy then becomes responsible for the management of the incapacitated person’s affairs subject to the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the Court of Protection requirements.
