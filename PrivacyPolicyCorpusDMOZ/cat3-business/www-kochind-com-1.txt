A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.

Agreement and Class Action Waiver
Mandatory Arbitration. YOU AND KOCH AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE KOCH SITE (each, a “Dispute”) to binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). You and Koch waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court.
In arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. A single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will conduct the arbitration, and the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law. The arbitration will be conducted in the county of your residence or another mutually agreed location. The AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. If AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA's rules and a form that can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at http://www.adr.org. You and Koch agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration, then a court may appoint a substitute arbitrator, and further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to the Arbitration Agreement.
The arbitrator will decide all issues relating to the enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application of this Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of arbitrability, whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration), and these Terms of Use, except that a court will resolve any question regarding the validity or enforceability of the class action waiver set forth in Section B of this Arbitration Agreement. The term "Dispute" and the requirement to arbitrate will be broadly interpreted.
Class Action Waiver. You and Koch agree the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general basis. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding and may only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding. If a court deems any portion of this Section B invalid or unenforceable, then Sections A and C of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void.
Fees and Costs in Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Koch will reimburse you for those fees up to $7,500, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Koch will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
Non-Arbitration Class Action and Jury Waiver. You and Koch agree that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and Koch waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the Dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis; and (3) neither you nor Koch may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE EARLIER OF: (1) THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREED OR ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH KOCH THAT CONTAINED AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than the applicable deadline and mailed to: Koch Communications Marketing, 4111 E. 37th Street North, Wichita, KS 67220 Attn: Counsel. The opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to this Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number and email address. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and failure to comply strictly with this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically will render the opt-out notice null and void. If you opt out of the arbitration provision, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply.
International Use/Export. The Content is not intended to be published or made available to any person in any jurisdiction where doing so would result in the violation of any applicable laws or regulations. Accordingly, if it is prohibited to make such Content available in your jurisdiction or to you (by reason of your nationality, residence or otherwise), it is not directed at you. Before reviewing this Koch Site, you must be satisfied that doing so will not result in such a violation and is not so prohibited, and by proceeding to use this Koch Site you confirm that this is not the case.
You acknowledge the Content may be subject to customs, trade sanctions and export laws and regulations of the United States and those of other countries. You agree to comply with such laws and regulations in your use of the Koch Site and its Content. You may not download, transfer, export or re-export any Content prohibited under customs, trade sanctions or export control laws, or otherwise, to any territory prohibited under United States trade sanctions regulations, or to any person, entity or organization designated on the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or majority-owned by a person, entity or organization so designated or to any person, entity or organization designated on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List. By Using a Koch Site or any Content, you represent and warrant you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which such import, export, or re-export is prohibited under United States trade sanctions regulations or export control laws and you are not a person or entity to which such export is prohibited under United States trade sanctions regulations or export control laws.
Consent to Electronic Communications. These Terms of Use and any other documentation, agreements, notices, or communications between you and Koch may be provided to you electronically to the extent permissible by law. Please print or otherwise save a copy of all documentation, agreements, notices, and other communications for your reference.
Miscellaneous. These Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions expressly incorporated by reference herein represent the entire agreement between you and Koch with respect to the subject matter contained in the Terms of Use and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under the Terms of Use without the prior written consent of Koch. If any provision herein is judicially interpreted or held to be void or otherwise unenforceable as written, such provision will be deemed to be revised and modified to the extent necessary to make it legally enforceable. In any event, the remaining terms of the Terms of Use will be enforceable as though the void or unenforceable provision did not exist. No delay or omission by Koch to exercise any right it has under the Terms of Use will impair or be construed as a waiver of such right. These Terms of Use and your use of the Koch Site shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles. In the event that the Arbitration Agreement above is deemed unenforceable or void, or if you opt out of such Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the process set forth therein, you irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts sitting in the State of Delaware, for purposes of any legal action arising out of or related to the use of the Koch Site or these Terms of Use.
