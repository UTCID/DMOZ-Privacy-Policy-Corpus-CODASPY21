Arbitration & Class Action Waiver. Effective October 8, 2015, by using Our Wi-Fi Service and joining our Marketing Program, you unconditionally consent and agree that: i) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against the Brookfield Properties Retail Parties and our affiliates (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Company Entities” or singularly as “Company Entity”) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with Our Wi-Fi Service or our Marketing Program or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available www.jamsadr.com, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate; ii) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; iii) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the Terms of Use and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with Our Wi-Fi Service or our Marketing Program; iv) the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; v) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Company Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; vi) the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim without affecting other individuals; vii) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Company Entity; viii) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Company Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Brookfield Properties Retail agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator; in addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Brookfield Properties Retail will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and ix) with the exception of subpart v) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.  If, however, subpart v) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor the Company Entities shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.  For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at www.jamsadr.com.
ACCORDINGLY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A COURT, TO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEDURES, OR TO A JURY TRIAL.
