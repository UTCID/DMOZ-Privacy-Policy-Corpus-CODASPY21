TOTAL ROPE CONTROLMEET YOUR NEW CLIMBING COMPANIONBreak AssistThis feature eliminates one of the most common causes of belay related accidents; when a belayer loads the rope into the device in the wrong direction.PANIC PROOF LOCKINGThe innovative panic proof locking mechanism (pat. pending) removes the necessity for a lever to release the rope when lowering the climber. This means that the REVO's mechanism cannot be accidentally overridden and held open.SMOOTH LOWERINGThe design of the REVO allows the climber to be lowered smoothly and consistently. You control the rope in the same way as instructed with a belay plate and with the protection of a backup locking mechanism.SWIPE LEFTSHOP NOWDISCOVER MORE
