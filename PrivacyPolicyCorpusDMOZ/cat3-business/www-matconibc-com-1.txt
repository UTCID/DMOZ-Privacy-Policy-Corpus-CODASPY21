The data controller pursuant to Art. 4 No. 7 General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 “GDPR”) is IDEX MPT, a company with its principal place of business at:
Bramley Drive, Vale Park West, Evesham, Worcestershire, WR11 1JH
and which can be contacted at the following email address: mptmarketing@idexcorp.com.
As described in sections 2 and 3 we process personal data for different purposes. The legal bases according to the GDPR for such processing are listed below (Please see our IDEX MPT Cookie Notice for information about processing of data derived from cookies):
Processing purposes
Lawful basis
Learn about our website(s) users’ browsing pattern and the performance of our website(s)
We only process this kind of cookie data if you have given us your prior consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Interaction with social media
These data are processed on the basis of statutory regulations, which allow us to process personal data to the extent necessary for the use of a service (Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR) or because we have a predominant legitimate interest in making the use of our website as easy and efficient as possible (Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR).
Providing our Sites to our users
Maintaining and improving our Sites
Providing and improving our customer service, including responding to your comments, questions and requests (e.g. product queries or technical questions)
Processing employment inquiries
Learning about how our products and services may be used
This data is processed on the basis of statutory provisions which allow us to process personal data to the extent necessary for the use of a service or the performance of a contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR), any processing for these purposes that is not necessary for the use of our website and the functions provided on the website is necessary for pursuing our or a third party’s legitimate interests which are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the users which require the protection of personal data (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). Insofar as the processing is based on our legitimate interests, such interests are running a stable and efficient website, having a good customer service, employing people, making our business processes more efficient and improving our business and services.
Analysing and managing our business
Improving our IT-security
Defending our legal interests, e.g. when claiming remedies of attacks on our website
Establishing and managing our business relationship, e.g. when you as a customer contact us via one of the Sites and we connect this request to your business account
The personal data is processed for pursuing our or a third party’s legitimate interests which are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the users which require the protection of personal data (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). The legitimate interests are running a user-friendly website, improving our offers by tailoring our offers to the individual user, running a secure and stable website, making our business processes more efficient and pursuing our legal rights.
Communicating with you about services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events offered by IDEX and others
Depending on the individual case such communication can be based on different legal bases. We might provide you with certain information based on a declaration of consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR), we might also provide you the information because you have subscribed to a specific service in which case the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). Certain communication might also be based on our legitimate interest to provide tailored marketing information to the users of the Sites (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR)
Carrying out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected
The legal basis will depend on the individual case.
Retention Periods
We delete or anonymise your personal data as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which we processed it.
In general, we store your personal data for the duration of the usage or the contractual relationship via the website plus a period of 15 days for IT security purposes.
In the event that you have given us your consent to process your data (e.g. for marketing purposes including the associated profiling), we will store your data until you revoke your consent or the processing purpose does not apply anymore.
For the retention period of cookies and other tracking, please refer to the details in our IDEX MPT Cookie Notice.
After these periods have expired, the data will be erased unless this data is required for a longer period due to legal retention periods, alternative purposes or for criminal prosecution. Beyond these retention periods, we may retain the data for the purposes of legal defence and law enforcement for as long as is necessary for the preparation or execution of a possible legal dispute (usually up to four years, whereby the legal dispute itself may inhibit the course of this period). If data can be stored for these reasons, it will be blocked. The data will then no longer be available for further use.
Transfer of Personal Data Outside the EU/EEA
In general, all data collected on the Sites is processed by IDEX MPT Corporation, i.e. a company located outside the EU/EEA. If and when transferring your personal data to which the GDPR applies onwards outside the EU/EEA, we will do so using one of the following safeguards:
the transfer is to a non-EU/EEA country which has an adequacy decision by the EU Commission;
the transfer is covered by a contractual agreement, which covers the GDPR requirements relating to transfers to countries outside the EU/EEA;
the transfer is to an organization which has Binding Corporate Rules approved by an EU data protection authority; or
the recipient is an organization in the US that is EU-US Privacy Shield certified; or
the transfer is covered by other approved safeguards in order to protect your personal data in a degree that equals the level of data protection in the European Union.
International transfers within IDEX Corporation are governed by EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers (as defined under the GDPR) and, where relevant, for Processors (as defined under the GDPR).
You may request a copy of the standard contractual clauses or other applicable safeguards by contacting mptmarketing@idexcorp.com
Your Rights
The applicable data protection law, especially the GDPR, provides you with certain rights in relation to the processing of your personal data. These rights are subject to various conditions under applicable data protection and privacy legislation.
All such requests may be sent to IDEX MPT. Those rights include:
Request access to personal data about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request rectification, correction, or updating to any of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
Request personal data provided by you to be transferred in machine-readable format (“data portability”).
Request erasure of personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no valid reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you (e.g. if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it).
Withdraw your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email request to IDEX MPT. You may also disable some types of cookies of our website directly in your Cookie Settings at any time the withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of the prior processing.
Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You have the right to make a complaint with a data protection authority.
RIGHT OF OBJECTION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT; FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 (1) (e) OR (f)  OF THE GDPR. WE WILL STOP PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING REASONS FOR PROCESSING WORTHY OF PROTECTION WHICH OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS.
Obligation to Provide Personal Data
You are under no contractual or statutory obligation to provide personal data. However, if you do not provide the personal data we require to process your request (e.g. when you contact us with questions about our products), we may not be able to respond to such request.
