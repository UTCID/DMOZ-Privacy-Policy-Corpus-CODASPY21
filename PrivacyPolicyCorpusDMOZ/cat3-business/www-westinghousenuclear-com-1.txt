4. How we share Personal Data
Westinghouse does not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Data collected through the Websites, except as described in this Online Privacy Statement.
Westinghouse does not share the Personal Data collected through the Websites for marketing purposes. Westinghouse shares your Personal data in the manner and for the purposes described below:
Sharing within Westinghouse. As Westinghouse is a global group headquartered in the US, with offices located across the globe, the Personal Data collected through the Websites may be shared  among the Westinghouse entities for the Purposes described above in this Online Privacy Statement (e.g., to provide and administer products and services; to fulfil contractual obligations; to communicate information about Westinghouse; to register and administer the accounts created or the applications submitted; as part of regular reporting activities; to maintain IT systems; to monitor and assure compliance with applicable policies and procedures, and applicable laws). Personal Data will be always accessed and used on a ‘need-to-know’ basis.
Sharing with Service Providers. Personal Data may be shared with service providers Westinghouse has retained to perform services on its behalf (such as companies providing customer management and support, optimizing services, managing newsletters and blogs; IT-Infrastructure service providers; software services providers or companies providing data analytics). These service providers are contractually required to safeguard the information provided to them by adopting adequate security measures, they are required to follow the instructions Westinghouse provides to them and are restricted from using or disclosing such information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.
Regulators, authorities, and other third parties. Personal Data may be transferred to regulators, courts, and other authorities (e.g. tax and law enforcement authorities), independent external advisors (e.g. auditors, external legal counsel, or other professional consultants), internal compliance and investigation teams (including external advisers appointed to conduct internal investigations) as necessary to comply with a legitimate legal request, to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or illegal activity.
Asset Purchasers. We reserve the right to transfer to relevant third-parties any Personal Data we have about you in the event of a potential or actual sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution or liquidation) or other business combination. In such case, we will require the relevant third parties to provide comparable levels of protection as the Westinghouse Group provides with respect to the Personal Data we share.
5. International Data Transfers
Given Westinghouse’s global business and operations, some of the recipients we may share Personal Data with may be located in countries which may have different data protection laws than the country in which the Personal Data was provided.
Some countries where recipients are located already provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data. Transfers to countries such as the USA, for example, may be protected under arrangements such as the EU-US Privacy Shield.
Transfers to Westinghouse entities will be regulated by adequate intra-group agreements, which contractually obliges each Westinghouse entity to ensure that Personal Data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within Westinghouse.
If recipients are located in other countries without adequate protections for Personal Data, Westinghouse will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection laws.
If you are located in the European Union and/or the European Economic Area ("EEA"), we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Data to recipients in countries outside of the EEA, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, which the European Commission has assessed as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data.
For more information about the appropriate safeguards in place, feel free to contact us.
6. Retention of Personal Data
To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we retain Personal Data we obtain about you though the Websites as long as (1) it is needed for the purposes for which we obtained it, in accordance with the provisions of this Online Privacy Statement or (2) we have another lawful basis, stated in this Online Privacy Statement or at the point of collection, for retaining that Personal Data beyond the period for which it is necessary to serve the original purpose.
Under some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent.
7. Security of Personal Data
We have implemented appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Data against accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure, these include data encryption, pseudo and anonymization, logical and physical access restriction and control, firewalls and recovery systems, integrity testing.
Westinghouse employees are regularly trained as to the handling of Personal Data and are obliged to comply with data secrecy in accordance with the legal requirements. We also limit access to Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties that have a legitimate business need for such access, and we contractually require that our third parties suppliers to adopt the necessary security measures to assure an adequate level of protection of Personal Data.
