Privacy Policy
Motor Trade Selection Privacy Notice
Motor Trade Selection (MTS) is committed to ensuring the privacy for our candidates, our clients and other visitors to our site. We ensure that we comply with those regulations that require that any data you provide to us is processed with due care and attention and is held securely.
MTS needs to collect personal data to allow us to run a recruitment business and to assist candidates to find employment.  Such data is typically your name, address, e-mail address, phone numbers and other contact information, work and education history, referees and links to certain social media sites, most importantly LinkedIn, together with your Nationality (to establish your right to work within the UK) and other information we may, from time to time, be required to collect by law.
Please note that, unless specifically requested, we do not require and actively discourage the sharing of the following information, especially as it may be used in identity theft and is of no use in the recruitment process:
Passport Number
Driving Licence Number
National Insurance Number
NHS Number
Bank and Building Society Details
Names and details of relations
And other such information that is not relevant to the recruitment process
In addition we may sometimes require you to answer additional questions, assessments and surveys through this site.  Questions and assessment help us judge your suitability for our recruitment assignments, surveys may help us improve our service to our clients and candidates, or provide detailed information for us to prepare reports about the industry for publication. Where we collect and aggregate information this will not contain personally identifiable information.
Your use of this website and the registration of your details on it means that you understand that MTS will in time disclose this information to prospective employers to facilitate the recruitment process for your potential benefit. We will also collect and process sensitive personal data when necessary to conform with legal requirements such as the Equality Act and FCA Regulations.
Every candidate application to us is carefully checked against previous applications to ensure consistency and integrity in the application. As a result previous applications are kept securely for up to 15 years in our recruitment software and document filing before being destroyed.  Requests to remove candidates from the database are complied with in the following way – data is only kept for reference to future applications but candidates are not kept on our active register, meaning that they will not appear in candidate searches when we are looking to fill particular roles, nor can candidates be contacted through our automated systems.
The security of your data is extremely important to us. Access to your personal data is only provided to our staff and third parties who help us to process data and, in order to help with the recruitment process, to prospective employers.
We will pass data to prospective or intended employers for the purpose of recruitment. Where necessary we may pass data to third parties that help us to process data, for example the providers of our Recruitment and Email Software. We may also share aggregate information with selected third parties but we do not disclose individual names or any identifying information.
For recruitment either in the UK or overseas that requires a Visa or Work permit we may have to share your data, with your consent, with Visa Agents, Embassies, Medical Testing facilities and transport providers or agents.
MTS tries to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information. We are passionate about candidate and client confidentiality and our systems are designed to protect all interested parties.
Cookies
Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information. Although we will not collect personal data on you unless you provide this to us, we do store a session cookie on your computer for the duration of your visit. This records your IP address, the pages you navigate between and the time and duration of your visit. This helps us to monitor overall traffic to the website. We do not use cookies to monitor your particular use of our website.
You can set your browser not to accept cookies. However, in a few cases some of our website features, like remembering your log in or your preferences, may not function as a result.
Complaints
We take any complaints very seriously. We encourage people to notify us immediately if they think that our collection or use of information is inaccurate, unfair, misleading or inappropriate. We would also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures.
Changes to this policy will be posted on this page and, if significant, may be communicated on the website or via e-mail.  If you wish to complain about this policy or any of the processes set out in it please contact:

We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

Every candidate needs that edge in today’s marketplace. How to professionally apply and present themselves to the future employers. We meet you either in person or online and explain how best to present your credentials, your experience and your personality.
X
We are paranoid about confidentiality. We never send out your details without speaking to you first, nor will we work with clients who we know will not respect your confidentiality. You have a right to explore the job market without your employer finding out.
