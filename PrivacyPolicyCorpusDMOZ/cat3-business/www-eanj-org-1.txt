Why operate in New Jersey's rapidly changing workplace alone? Regardless of the amount of time spent on addressing a specific employee relation issue or problem, each member receives prompt information and guidance on personnel policies, benefits administration and human resource practices from a professionally staffed HelpLine.  Top HelpLine categories typically include FMLA, Wage and Hour, Benefits Administration, Harassment, Immigration and more.
EANJ does not render legal advice, legal opinion or engage in the practice of law. For such advice or opinion the services of an attorney competent in the areas of labor and/or employment law should be retained.
