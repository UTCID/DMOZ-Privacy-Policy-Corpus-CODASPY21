Glossary
What is a signature panel?
A signature panel is a solid (white) or translucent writable surface that is applied
to a specific area or areas that is typically used for a signature. When using a
signature panel, the only area that will accept writing is confined to the applied
surface.
What is a matte finish?
A matte finish is a writable translucent finish that allows an entire surface to
be writable. Because a matte finish is translucent, it works well for designs that
require one or many specific writable areas that are defined in the artwork.
What about thermal printing?
Thermal printing is done with a special printer that uses a heated print head and
pressure to transfer type and/or an image onto a plastic card. A special thermal
laminate must be applied during the manufacturing process to allow this method of
printing. Thermal laminate is only available on PVC cards and cannot be ordered
online. However, we will be happy to help you with a PVC card order when you call us at 800-318-3500.
