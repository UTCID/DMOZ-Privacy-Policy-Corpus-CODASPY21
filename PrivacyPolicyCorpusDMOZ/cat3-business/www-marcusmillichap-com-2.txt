Additionally, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall not apply to these Terms of Use or the Site. In the event you desire to initiate any suit against Marcus & Millichap arising out of or relating to the Site and/or these Terms of Use, you agree to bring such suit in the federal courts sitting in the District of Delaware, USA unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case you agree to bring such suit in the state courts sitting in Delaware, USA.

These Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions that may appear on the Site from time-to-time (including, without limitation, additional representations that we may ask you to make when submitting information to the Site) contain the full understanding with respect to your use and access of the Site and supersede all prior agreements, terms, conditions and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to such use and access of the Site. You may not transfer any rights or obligations you may have to your account or under these Terms of Use without our prior written consent. We may transfer our rights under these Terms of Use without your consent. If any portion of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be modified in accordance with the applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intention of the applicable provision, and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. A printed version of these Terms of Use of Use and of any notices given to you in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The failure of Marcus & Millichap to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. None of our rights or remedies conferred by these Terms of Use are exclusive of any other right or remedy conferred herein or by law or in equity; rather, all of such rights and remedies are cumulative of every other such right or remedy and may be exercised concurrently or separately from time-to-time. If we bring any suit against you to enforce these Terms of Use or otherwise in connection with your use and/or access of the Site, you agree that if we prevail in such suit we shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses incurred in such suit including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms of Use.
