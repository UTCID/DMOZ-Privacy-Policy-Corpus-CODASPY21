Cookie Policy
Our website uses a number of cookies to store data on our visitor's computers. By continuing to use the MMD GPHC Limited website (the "Site" or this “website”), you are agreeing to the use of cookies in the manner described in this notice.
To find out how to control the cookies that are created on your device please see this page (https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-control-cookies/). To find out how to delete cookies please see this page (https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies/). For more information about managing cookies, please see http://www.aboutcookies.org/.
Cookies created by this website
Cookies are used on this website to save people's settings and can sometimes be used to track how visitors get to and interact with websites.
This website creates a number of cookies, which are referred to as first party cookies as they are specific to the host site that created them.  All the first-party cookies which are created do not store any personal or sensitive information, or anything that makes you personally identifiable to us. They are used for essential functionality such as security when processing form data or for analytics which helps us use anonymous visitor data to gain a better understanding of how people use our website.
Consent and managing cookies
By browsing or using our site you agree that we and the selected third parties in this notice can use (as described in this notice) data collected by the cookies you allow. If you do not agree, you can withdraw your consent by setting your browser to reject cookies, see below.
There are several ways to manage cookies. You can:
Set your browser to prevent cookies from being accepted. More information should be in your browser’s “help” menu. How to adjust your browser will depend on which browser you’re using.
Set some browsers to send you an alert when a website is trying to place a cookie on your browser.
Block cookies by activating the setting on your browser to refuse all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies including strictly necessary cookies, site access and features can be limited or not available.
Use an ad blocker to block any of the tools specifically or individually, including Google Analytics.
Delete cookies stored in your browser by “clearing cookies”. This will only delete cookies already stored. It won’t prevent new ones being accepted unless you change the acceptance settings. Also, clearing your cookies on one browser of one device does not automatically clear them on another. You need to clear all browsers on all devices, independently.
Refuse specific cookies, by using that cookies opt out process, in the table at the end of this notice.
Session ID
Our website may create an essential session cookie, which is essential for your use of some of the interactive elements of the website.
These include your session, which means it saves information on what you have done on the site during this current visit (for example what pages you have visited and whether you have logged in).
The cookie contains a session ID which is a mechanism for distinguishing your visit to our website from any other visitors that may be using the website at the same time. This cookie expires when you leave our website.
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics, which creates a number of first-party cookies.
Full details of the cookies which Google Analytics uses can be found in Cookies & Google Analytics in documentation for Google's Analytics tracking code. You can also read Google's Privacy Policy for Google Analytics.
We don't share the data that Google Analytics collects, and we don't believe that our use of Google Analytics is privacy-intrusive. We use the data that is collected in the following ways:
to report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use our website;
to understand overall visitor behaviour; and
to inform how we update and improve our website.
To opt out of our use of Google Analytics you may wish to consider using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (this will open a separate window in your browser).
Paid Search Marketing
We use Google Ads as a means of advertising our website. If you click on a sponsored advert on Google, information about the ad and keywords that brought you to our website is stored in a _ga cookie. This helps us track visits from Google Ads that led to an enquiry, so that we can determine the return on investment of our advertising spend.
No personally identifiable information is stored in this cookie, however we may be able to associate a contact form you have submitted, with analytics data. This information is used to determine which ads and keywords led to an enquiry, so that we can optimise the Google Ads campaign accordingly.
When people interact with our ads (by clicking a text ad or viewing a video ad), Google Ads stores cookies that contain information about the interaction. When someone submits an enquiry on our website, a conversion tracking tag reads this cookie and sends it back to Google Ads with the conversion information.
Remarketing
When you visit our website we may add a Google Remarketing tracking tag which allows Google to create a cookie to track when you have visited our website. Google uses this cookie to determine other websites you may be interested in or if you use other Google products, it may have tracked information about your internet browsing behaviour. This information can then be used in Google Ads to show our ads to you on other Google Network sites or Google Properties.
Hubspot
We use a marketing software called Hubspot which creates cookies for analytics purposes. If you submit an enquiry through our website we may store your details in HubSpot to help process your enquiry and help us determine the sources of enquiries, i.e. from which marketing campaigns did the enquiry originate.
Hubspot creates cookies for analytics purposes to help us determine the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Cookies created by external services
In addition to our first-party cookies, you may be served one or more of the following third-party cookies during your visit to our website. By using our website we'll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on our website, but we have provided information at the top of this page on how you can set your browser to prevent cookies being created.
Third party cookies are cookies created by an external service when you use a page on our website. These cookies are specific to the third-party's domain and accordingly the data held in them can be seen and managed by the third party and not by us. We control whether or not we use the third-party service with our website, and how it is integrated and presented on our website. We do not have control over the cookies themselves. We carefully select 3rd party services to use on our website; ones that are not likely to abuse your privacy according to the terms of their privacy policies.
AddToAny
AddToAny.com is a content sharing plugin that we use on our website to allow users to share our content on social networking sites.
By design, AddToAny does not store personal data. Their technology vendors are compliant, and may temporarily store an IP address and set a client cookie for security purposes as the regulations allow.
YouTube
We may use YouTube to host video content.  When you view a web page on our site with an embedded YouTube video, YouTube creates at least three cookies: VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE, YSC, and GSP. We use the YouTube service as a convenience for our visitors, and we use it on the basis that Google adheres to its privacy policy.
The cookies are created to track video usage and to report on video analytics. YouTube may also use the data to suggest other videos you may be interested in.
Other cookies
From time to time we may use additional external services on our website which may create cookies on your device. As we add new services or make changes that use cookies, we will update this cookie policy with the details.
If you have any concerns about the cookies we create, please contact us and we'll be happy to answer your questions.
