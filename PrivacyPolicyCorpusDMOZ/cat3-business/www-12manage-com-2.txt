1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Welcome. 12manage B.V. (12manage) provides its service to you, subject to
the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time
to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of
the TOS at any time at: https://www.12manage.com/terms.htm. In addition, when
using particular 12manage services, you and 12manage shall be subject to any
posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted
from time to time. All such guidelines or rules (including but not limited
to our Spam Policy) are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. 12manage
may also offer other services that are governed by different Terms of Service.
2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
12manage currently provides users with access to a rich collection of resources
through its network of properties (the "Service"). You understand and
agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements
are necessary for 12manage to provide the Service. You also understand and
agree that the service may include certain communications from 12manage, such
as service announcements, administrative messages and 12manage newsletters,
and that these communications are considered part of 12manage membership and
you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated
otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including
the release of new 12manage properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand
and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that 12manage assumes no
responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store
any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for
obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees
(such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible
for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery
of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all
equipment necessary to access the Service.
3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of
legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving
services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction.
You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information
about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information
being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration
Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information
that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or 12manage has reasonable
grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current
or incomplete, 12manage has the right to suspend or terminate your account
and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion
thereof).
