About Oracle
Strategic Acquisitions
Oracle and Sun Microsystems
Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, and since that time Oracle's hardware and software engineers have worked side-by-side to build fully integrated systems and optimized solutions designed to achieve performance levels that are unmatched in the industry. Early examples include the Oracle Exadata Database Machine X2-8, and the first Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, both introduced in late 2010. During 2011, Oracle introduced the SPARC SuperCluster
T4-4, a general-purpose, engineered system with Oracle Solaris that delivered record-breaking performance on a series of enterprise benchmarks. Oracle's SPARC-based systems are some of the most scalable, reliable, and secure products available today. Sun's prized software portfolio has continued to develop as well, with new releases of Oracle Solaris, MySQL, and the recent introduction of Java 7. Oracle invests in innovation by designing hardware and software systems that are engineered to work together.
