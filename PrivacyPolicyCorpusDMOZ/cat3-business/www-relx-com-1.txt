Policies
The RELX Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is a guide to the way we go about achieving our business goals and helps us behave in an open, honest, ethical and principled manner. It incorporates the provisions of the UN Global Compact to which we are a signatory.
In 2018, we updated the Code to ensure its ongoing currency and clarity.
The revised code is disseminated to our employees worldwide and all employees receive related online training.
