Social Media Policy
Guidelines and best practices for effectively promoting ACM on online platforms.
ACM Social Media Policies and Best Practices
ACM encourages members and volunteers to use social media to engage with one another and communicate about ACM activities, conferences, publications, and professional development resources. The following guidelines and best practices are intended to assist ACM volunteers, SIG leaders, conference organizers, chapter leaders, EICs, members and staff in effectively promoting ACM on online platforms intended for users to share and engage with content.
Social Media Policy
Content posted on social networks on behalf of ACM, SIGs, chapters, conferences and publications should adhere to the expectations of professional and ethical conduct established in the ACM Code of Ethics.
ACM branding and trademarks used on social media platforms should be consistent with ACM’s Visual Identity Standards Guide.
Images posted to social networks representing ACM should either belong to ACM, a SIG, a chapter, conference or publication or be free to use and share.
Third-party content should be properly attributed to its original source.
Social media accounts representing ACM should include a statement in the account profile, bio or “about” section (see examples to the right).
Best Practice Guidelines
Schedule posts when your audience is most active and likely to engage with your content, and ensure that there is a steady stream of posts from your account.
The text of social posts should maintain a conversational and accessible tone while conveying professionalism and a sense of authority on the topic.
Visually engaging content is more likely to generate higher engagement, so posts should contain a prominent photo, video or illustration whenever possible.
Third-party content (posts not directly related to an ACM activity, product, or service) should come from reputable and authoritative sources and be of interest to the broader computing community. Posts should also not promote commercial products or services.
Posts should include relevant hashtags to increase their exposure and “@mentions” to engage other users who would be interested in their content.
Social media content should be viewed as part of a conversation, and posts should aim to generate reactions, comments and engagement.
ACM social media representatives are encouraged to actively monitor comments from followers and respond in a timely and professional manner.
Questions? Please contact social@acm.org.
Tips for Content Development and Account Management
Use a colloquial yet authoritative tone in posts
Upload eye-catching photos in posts whenever possible
Use hashtags to reach more users and connect posts with the broader conversation on their topic.
Schedule posts for when intended audiences experience highest social traffic (typically 10am - 3pm local time)
Interact with followers by responding to messages and comments, sharing their content, and liking relevant posts
Identify, monitor, and engage with subject area influencers
