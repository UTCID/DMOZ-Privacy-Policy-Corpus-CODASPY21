Protect Your Future With a Personal Liability Umbrella Policy
If you experience a major insurance claim or lawsuit, your underlying policies such as auto, homeowners, or boat owners may not provide enough liability coverage. A State Farm® Personal Liability Umbrella Policy may provide the additional liability coverage you need to help protect your financial future.

What a Personal Liability Umbrella Policy Provides*

Minimum coverage of $1 million for covered claims, which can be increased in $1 million increments
How a Personal Liability Umbrella Policy Can Help
Auto
While driving, you change lanes and cause an accident, which results in multiple injuries to passengers of another vehicle.
Contact an agent and protect your passengers
Home
While cooking, you leave your stove unattended. In addition to damaging your property, the fire also damages your neighbor's property and injures your neighbors. As a result, you may have to pay for any repairs to your neighbor's dwelling in addition to any injury claims.
Be a good neighbor and talk to an agent
Boat
While operating your boat, you hit a water skier and cause serious injury.
Find an agent and calm the waters
