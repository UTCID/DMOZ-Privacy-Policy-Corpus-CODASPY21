How to
control and delete cookies
Most web browsers
automatically accept cookies but you do not have to accept cookies and you can,
should you choose at any time, reject or block the use of cookies and delete all
cookies stored on your device.
TWI does not use
cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. We use them to
help us provide you with a better service. However, if you wish to restrict or block
any cookies you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within
your browser should tell you how.
For example, this
is how it can be achieved in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0:
Press the ‘F1’
key
The Help function
appears. Type in ‘cookie’ in the Help search box and follow the instructions
You can also delete
cookies in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 by:
Selecting 'Tools/Internet
Options'
Clicking on 'Delete'
in the Browsing History section
Then select 'delete
cookies'.
In addition to
this, options to accept, block, or require notification for the use of cookies are
found under:
'Tools/Internet
Options/Privacy/Advanced'.
Please be aware
however that if you choose to block cookies you may not be able to access certain
features of this web site. For rejecting and deleting cookies on other web browsing
platforms and mobile devices you may need to refer to your software or device manual.
AboutCookies.org or

guide to the use of cookies online. You can find more general information about
how to delete and control cookies through your browser at these sites. Please note
that TWI is not responsible for the content of third party website sites but has
provided these links in good faith to help you make an informed decision about your
online privacy and cookie settings.
It may be that
your concerns about cookies are related to malicious spyware. Rather than switching
off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the
same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
