We are proud to support the communities and people of Vermont.
We believe that we can and should leverage our capital to support causes that are in alignment with our values and that positively impact and improve the lives of Vermonters.
By providing member-focused products and services, we help empower our members’ financial prosperity.
We want to leave the world a better place than we found it by promoting sustainable energy and development.
Cooperation multiplies impact. We’re volunteering in our communities and supporting local cooperatives.
Fostering Vibrant Communities
Improving the quality of life for all Vermonters is a lofty goal. It is also VSECU’s mission. The philanthropic work of the credit union focuses on the basic needs of Vermonters—food, shelter, heat, financial literacy, and the environment. Find out how we follow through on our mission by meeting the needs of our communities.
Each year VSECU will determine a community giving budget based on our net income. The CEO, the Giving Committee, and the Board of Directors, acting together or independently, may allocate these funds subject to specific guidelines. Our gifts vary from small amounts of $50 to larger donations of several thousand dollars. Contributions must be for a non-political, non-sectarian purpose.
All requests for gifts are reviewed.
Although we cannot support every request submitted, we do our best to be fair and equitable, demonstrating our commitment to allocating funds around the state. Gifts will be awarded
that are in alignment with our sustainable principles that focus on the essential needs of
Vermonters and community in these areas:
Food
Shelter
Heat
Environment
Financial literacy
Preference may also be given to organizations requesting gifts whose environmental goals, activities, and ethics are consistent with the Environmental Mission Statement adopted by the credit union.
