Cookie Notice
Miller respects your personal privacy and is committed to adhering to the applicable privacy and data protection laws and industry guidelines, including GDPR. This cookie notice ("Cookie Notice") and our Website Privacy Notice describe how we handle the personal information that you provide to us on this website ("Website"). This notice applies only to the Miller website and not to any third-party sites that may be accessible from here.
Cookies
To make this website simpler to use and navigate, we sometimes place a small data file on your computer or device. These are known as cookies. Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognize you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.
They make your visit simpler by:
Remembering settings, so you don't have to re-enter them at every page you visit (such as placing items in an ecommerce shopping basket)
Remembering information you've given (such as a Zip or Postal Code) so you don't need to keep re-entering it
Measuring how you use our website so we can improve it to meet your needs
We use cookies to make the site work better for you and because they are essential to the usage of our website. You can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish. Learn more about cookies and how to manage them at AboutCookies.org.
If you prevent cookie usage on this website then please note that some parts may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
If you do not want any information collected, then you should choose not to use the Miller website.
