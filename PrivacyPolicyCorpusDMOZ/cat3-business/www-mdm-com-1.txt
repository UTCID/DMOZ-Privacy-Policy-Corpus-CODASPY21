Updated: September 2020
Gale Media, Inc.

Data Retention/Security
Your Personally Identifiable Information is stored on the servers of our service providers and vendors. These are located in Canada, Malta, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
We will retain your PII for as long as you maintain an account with the Company, or as otherwise necessary to provide you the Company’s Services. We will also retain your PII where necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. When we no longer need the information for the purposes outlined in this Policy, we will delete your PII.
We take every precaution to protect your PII against accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves over the Internet. We do not knowingly collect or receive personal data from children under 13 years of age. If we learn we have received Personally Identifiable Information from a child, we will delete the data.
We restrict access to your PII to those employees of the Company who need to know that information to provide services to you. We train those employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. Service Providers and vendors have access to PII to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes.
However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us. There is no guarantee that the data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
The Services may, from time to time, contain links to other websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they may have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or websites. Please check these privacy policies before you submit any PII. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Services and by us and not to other websites that you may link to from here.
We use SSL security on any form that requires credit-card or debit-card information. We will never ask for information that could be used in a phishing scheme without the SSL security behind the form.
Disclosures of Personal Information
As mentioned above, we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to selected third parties associated with payment processing, website administration and our own marketing, including ad retargeting via NextRoll, Inc. These third parties are contractually bound to use PII only to perform the services that we hire them to provide.
In addition, we may ask you to provide personal information to access sponsored content, includes whitepapers, webcasts and other products or services. When accessing this content, your PII may be shared with those third parties, and the information will be governed by their privacy policy. We do not bear any responsibility for the actions or policies of these third parties.
We use service providers and vendors to process PII in the following countries: Canada, Malta, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Data protection and privacy laws in these countries may offer a lower level of protection than in your country and/or region.
Personally Identifiable Information collected within the EEA will be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Policy. We rely on derogations outlined in Article 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation to transfer PII outside of the EEA. In particular, we transfer it out of the EEA with your consent or to perform a contract with you. We apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Policy. By providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us, you are consenting to the transfer, storing, and processing of your personal information outside of the EEA.

We and other third party service providers, also use various technologies to collect and store information when you use the Services, including cookies and similar tracking technologies, to administer the Services and track users’ movement around the Services. For additional information on how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, as well as how to opt-out of the use of cookies, please see our Cookies Statement.
Our partners, such as NextRoll, Inc., may use non-cookie technologies that may not be impacted by browser settings that block cookies. To opt out of receiving these personalized ads or cross device tracking, the following third-party opt-out tools can be used for that purpose:
—DAA: http://www.aboutads.info/
—NAI: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1
—EDAA (Europe only): http://www.youronlinechoices.com/

Please note that opting-out of promotional mailings will not affect delivery of your subscription-based products.
To remove a specific phone number or fax number from a specific brand’s marketing communications, please follow the opt-out directions provided during/in those communications. To remove a specific phone/fax number from all of MDM’s marketing communications, you may send a request to info@mdm.com.
