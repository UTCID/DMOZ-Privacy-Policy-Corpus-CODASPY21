Certain limitations apply. Subject to approval. See your local store for details. Checks may be issued instead of cash. More details
and disclosures about payday advances per state are available online by reading the fees and terms. See center or
specific state selection for more details and additional disclosures. A single payday advance is typically for two to four
weeks. However, borrowers often use these loans over a period of months, which can be expensive. Payday advances are not recommended for long-term
financial solutions.
