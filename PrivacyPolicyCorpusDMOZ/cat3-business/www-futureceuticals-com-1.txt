On occasion, we may receive personal information from third-party sources, such as where our trusted suppliers provide anonymized web analytics and reporting services.

We do not sell your personal information and have not sold your personal information in the last twelve (12) months.  We do not sell the personal information of minors.

We may share your personal data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, sister companies, or other entities within our group of companies to administer and manage group functions, including the provision of our products and services to you and in the course of audits. We may also share your information with any other group company that fulfills your order or with whom you communicate.
Your personal information may be shared with companies providing services under contract to FutureCeuticals, such as logistics companies, IT hosting and/or IT maintenance providers, or third-party storage or service-provider companies that perform some functions including the processing of data.
