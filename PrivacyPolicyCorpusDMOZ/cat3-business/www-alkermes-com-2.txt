NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This website, including the management presentations, web casts and press releases made available through this web site, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements may include words like “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” or “anticipate,” and describe opinions or expectations about future events. Although we believe that such expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge, known and unknown risks may cause Alkermes’ actual results and performances to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, (a) our collaborators could elect to terminate or delay programs at any time; (b) we and our collaborators may not be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake new or additional clinical trials for product candidates incorporating our technologies, or clinical trials could be delayed; (c) even if clinical trials are completed and the data is submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or a competent authority within the European Union as a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for marketing approval and to other health authorities as a marketing authorization application (“MAA”), the NDA or MAA could fail to be accepted, or could fail to receive approval on a timely basis, if at all; (d) disputes with collaborators, termination of collaborations or failure to negotiate acceptable new collaborative arrangements for our technologies, could occur; (e) even if our product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development, product candidates could fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals, be difficult to manufacture on a large scale, be uneconomical, fail to achieve market acceptance, be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties or experience substantial competition in the marketplace; (f) we could incur difficulties or set-backs in obtaining the substantial additional funding required to continue research and development programs and clinical trials; and (g) the impact of competitive products, patents, product liability and third-party reimbursement risks associated with the pharmaceutical industry. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These reports are available at www.sec.gov or through the Investor section of our website.  We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
