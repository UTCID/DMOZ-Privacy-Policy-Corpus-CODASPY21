Privacy Statement
The SPACE Agency recognizes the
importance of protecting the privacy of our customers and prospects. In adopting
this customer privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business
interests in collecting and using your information with your reasonable
expectations of privacy.
Unless specifically and
knowingly provided by the individual, we do not collect personally identifying
information. Furthermore, e-mail addresses are not disclosed to third parties
for any purpose. We do, however, automatically collect anonymous information via
our Web servers. This includes information about each user's visit to our Web
site, such as pages visited, the date and time of each page view, and the domain
name of visitors. This is used for internal statistical and market research
purposes only. Such information will not be posted or published by us, nor
provided to any third parties.
Technology on the Internet is
developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the
on-line arena. If we need to change our privacy policy in the future, we will
post these changes as soon as they go into effect.
