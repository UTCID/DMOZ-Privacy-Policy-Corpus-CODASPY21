Choice of Law; Access Restrictions
These Terms and Conditions will be construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America, excluding provisions of Virginia law concerning choice-of-law that would result in the laws of any state or country other than Virginia being applied. However, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (or any substantially similar law enacted by Virginia) will not apply to these Terms and Conditions, and instead the law of Virginia as it exists without reference to the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will apply. Any claims, actions or proceedings related to a Freddie Mac web site or these Terms and Conditions must be brought in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division. By using a Freddie Mac web site, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of said court for such purposes.

Any Supplemental Terms (i) will be disclosed to you, either by being posted on the applicable Freddie Mac web site or by being included in a separate agreement, (ii) will be in addition to these Terms and Conditions, (iii) will, if expressly so indicated, supersede specific portions of these Terms and Conditions, and (iv) will be binding on you by virtue of your use of the applicable Freddie Mac web site.  If there is any conflict between these Terms and Conditions and any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will take precedence over these Terms and Conditions but only for the specific transaction or information to which the Supplemental Terms apply.
Severability Waiver
The provisions of these Terms and Conditions are severable. If any such provision is determined to be unenforceable, such unenforceability will not affect any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, and the Terms and Conditions will be construed as if such unenforceable provision had not been contained herein. No waiver by Freddie Mac of any right under or provision of these Terms and Conditions will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other such right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time.
Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Freddie Mac and each of its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all injuries, damages, losses, liabilities, claims, judgments and settlements, including all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys' fees, arising out of any action or claim related to any negligent or willful act or omission by you while accessing a Freddie Mac web site or your failure to comply with any of these terms and conditions.
