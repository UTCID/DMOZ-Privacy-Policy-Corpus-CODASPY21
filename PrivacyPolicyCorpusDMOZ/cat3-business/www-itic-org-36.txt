Regulatory Compliance
Go Back
Regulatory uncertainty poses one of the greatest challenges to a company’s ability to succeed in markets around the world and for the global economy to thrive. By working closely with governments, standards-setting bodies, and other NGOs, ITI encourages the development and adoption of globally aligned, internationally recognized standards and regulatory best practices to help its members navigate and overcome the growing patchwork of rules and regulations that threatens to fragment the market. With established networks of industry resources in Asia and in Latin America, and with the guidance of leading worldwide compliance and technical experts, ITI works to resolve and prevent technical barriers to trade so its member companies can bring beneficial technology to global consumers in the most efficient way.
