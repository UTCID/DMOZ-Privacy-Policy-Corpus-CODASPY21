TSC RentalConnect is an online service in which once you are registered, an online account is created for you. To register for your account, you must provide us with your name, a valid address within the United States and an email address, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

By registering, you certify that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older. If any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate or not current, or if TSCI has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate or not current, TSCI, at its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your order of, use of, and/or access to any Service, Service Website and/or Content, and refuse all current or future orders of, use of, and/or access to, any Service, Service Website and/or Content, or suspend or terminate any portion thereof.

You agree to receive email notifications, TSCI blog postings and its monthly newsletter.  At any time you may opt out.
2. REPORT AND SCORE SERVICE
The Report and Score Service allows you to establish connections with third parties and authorize or request that they authorize the sharing of Tenant Screening Report. This Service will enable you as a Report Subject to (a) view your Tenant Screening Report ordered by you as a Report Subject, and (b) authorize and view your Tenant Screening Report viewed by End Users; or will enable you as an End User to view Tenant Screening Report about a Report Subject for which you have been authorized as an End User, for a limited time.
When instructed by Report Subject, Report Subject is authorizing TSCI to provide Report Subject’s Tenant Screening Report to End Users with whom Report Subject has successfully connected for up to thirty days from the date of the Report Subject’s most recent order for Tenant Screening Report (“Request Time”). Each End User may access the Report Subject’s then current Tenant Screening Report and subsequently view a copy of the Report Subject’s Tenant Screening Report during the remaining Request Time associated with the applicable order for Tenant Screening Report unless the Report Subject terminates (deletes, cancels, removes or declines) an End User’s connection, access request or view capability. When an End User accesses the Report Subject’s Tenant Screening Report, a copy of the Report Subject’s Tenant Screening Report will be posted to the End User’s and Report Subject’s accounts, and an update will be made to the VantageScore credit score on the Report Subject’s dashboard. Report Subject acknowledges and agrees that TSCI is not responsible for any actions or decisions made by any third parties with whom the Report Subject has agreed to share their Tenant Screening Report.
You may provide TSCI with the email addresses of consumers with whom you wish to connect. TSCI will send an invitation request to the email address provided by you which will include your name, email address and any text you provide. Your name and email address will be available to all third parties with whom you have or had a successful connection. You authorize TSCI to share your name and email address as described herein and required by the Report and Score Service.

17. FCRA DISPUTES OF CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION
Accurate adverse information on Report Subject’s credit report cannot be changed.

Report Subject may request a consumer file disclosure at no charge within 60 days of ordering Report Subject’s Tenant Screening Report, by contacting TSCI at www.info@tsci.com. In any other situation, Report Subject may contact TSCI at www.info@tsci.com or 800-799-8861 for assistance at any time, which may be subject to applicable fees.
18. VANTAGESCORE
The Report and Score Service utilizes the VantageScore credit score. The VantageScore credit score may or may not be used by Report Subject’s lenders, and is not an endorsement or guarantee of Report Subject’s credit worthiness as seen by lenders.
Please be aware that there are many scoring models used in the marketplace. Each scoring model may have its own set of factors and scale. The information and credit scoring may be different than that used by a lender. The VantageScore credit score may not be identical in every respect to any other credit score produced by another company or used by Report Subject’s lender.
Report Subject’s VantageScore credit score is calculated using Report Subject’s actual data from Report Subject’s credit file on the day that you request Report Subject’s report. Keep in mind, however, that other factors, such as length of employment and annual salary, are often taken into consideration by lenders when making decisions about Report Subject. How each lender weighs their chosen factors may vary, but the exact formula used to calculate Report Subject’s score is proprietary.
Also note that each consumer reporting agency has its own set of data, resulting in a separate VantageScore credit score for each of Report Subject’s credit files.
You agree to request VantageScore credit scores only for your use alone for the purposes stated in these Terms and Conditions and for no other purpose or use. All VantageScore credit scores provided hereunder will be held in strict confidence and may never be sold, licensed, copied, reused, disclosed, reproduced, revealed or made accessible, in whole or in part, to any person except as required by law.
VantageScore; is owned by VantageScore Solutions, LLC.
19. NOT A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION OR CONTRACT
TSCI offers access to services including an abbreviated version of a Report Subject’s consumer credit report, or VantageScore credit score. TSCI is not acting as a credit repair organization when providing Report Subject with the Service, and is not offering to sell, provide or perform any service to Report Subject for the express or implied purpose of either improving Report Subject’s credit record, credit history or credit rating or providing advice or assistance to Report Subject with regard to improving Report Subject’s credit record, credit history or credit rating. Report Subject acknowledges and agrees that Report Subject is not seeking to purchase, use, or access any of the Service, Service Website, and Content in order to do so.
20. NO WARRANTY BY TSCI
REPORT SUBJECT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO REPORT SUBJECT THROUGH THE SERVICE, AND THE REPORT SUBJECT’S TENANT SCREENING REPORT AND THE VANTAGE SCORE CREDIT SCORE, INCLUDING THE SCORE FACTORS DERIVED FROM THE ELEMENTS IN REPORT SUBJECT’S CREDIT REPORT, MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS REPORT SUBJECT’S REPORT CHANGES. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, SERVICE WEBSITE AND CONTENT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. ALL SERVICE, SERVICE WEBSITE AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” OR “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TSCI AND ITS SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SERVICE, SERVICE WEBSITE, CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS YOU MAY RECEIVE FROM TSCI DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. TSCI MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE SERVICE AND CONTENT ARE ACCURATE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; AND (II) ANY RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR CONTENT WILL BE RELIABLE.
21. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TSCI WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE ANY SERVICE, THE SERVICE WEBSITE OR CONTENT, EVEN IF TSCI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS EITHER DO NOT ALLOW OR PLACE RESTRICTIONS UPON THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN CERTAIN TYPES OF AGREEMENTS; FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE AFOREMENTIONED LIMITATION ON LIABILITY SHALL BE TO THE MAXIMUM DEGREE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, LIABILITY IS IMPOSED UPON TSCI, THEN YOU AGREE THAT TSCI’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY OR ALL OF YOUR LOSSES OR INJURIES FROM TSCI’S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE CLAIM, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE MONETARY AMOUNT, IF ANY, PAID BY THE APPLICABLE REPORT SUBJECT.
22. CLAIMS BY BINDING ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
SUMMARY:
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CONTACTING TSCI AT INFO@TSCI.COM REGARDING THE SERVICE, SERVICE WEBSITE OR CONTENT.  IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT TSCI IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF TSCI HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IT HAS WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. WE ALSO AGREE THAT ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING WHETHER A DISPUTE IS ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR, NOT A COURT. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND TSCI WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
Arbitration Agreement:
(a) TSCI and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. It includes, but is not limited to:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
We also agree that any controversy concerning whether a dispute or claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator, not a court, including the scope, applicability, validity, enforceability, interpretation, or formation of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement’s other terms and conditions, and any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “TSCI,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information under this or prior Agreements between us.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and TSCI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to TSCI should be addressed to: TSCI, 6570 Oakmont Drive, Suite B, Santa Rosa, CA 95409 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If TSCI and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or TSCI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by TSCI or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or TSCI is entitled.
(c) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Unless TSCI and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, TSCI will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse TSCI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
(d) The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the final award, pursuant to applicable law and the AAA Rules.
(e) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(f) YOU AND TSCI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and TSCI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
23. DATA AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP
You acknowledge that TSCI has expended substantial time, effort and funds to create and deliver the Service and compile its various databases. All data in TSCI’s databases and any other intellectual property that are part of the Service are and will continue to be TSCI’s exclusive property.

This Agreement shall otherwise be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
30. SEVERABILITY

The foregoing does not apply to Section 22(f) of this Agreement; if Section 22(f), or any portion thereof, is found to be unenforceable, the arbitration clause (but only the arbitration clause) shall be null and void.

A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.
You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment – or to take another adverse action against you – must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.
You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file disclosure”). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:
a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;
you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file;
your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;
you are on public assistance;
you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.
In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for additional information.
You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.
You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for an explanation of dispute procedures.
Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.
Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.
Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need — usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.
You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address form the lists these offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).
The following FCRA right applies with respect to nationwide consumer reporting agencies:
Consumers Have the Right To Obtain a Security Freeze
You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization.The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.
As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.
A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.
You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.
Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your federal rights, contact:

normal business hours and on reasonable notice.
(b) Files maintained on a consumer shall be made available for the consumer’s visual inspection, as follows:
– In person, if he appears in person and furnishes proper identification. A copy of his file shall also be available to
the consumer for a fee not to exceed the actual costs of duplication services provided.
– By certified mail, if he makes a written request, with proper identification, for copies to be sent to a specified

the investigative consumer reporting agencies.
– A summary of all information contained in files on a consumer and required to be provided by Section 1786.10

consumer.
(c) The term “proper identification” as used in subdivision (b) shall mean that information generally deemed sufficient to
identify a person. Such information includes documents such as a valid driver’s license, social security account number,

Resumen de sus Derechos bajo el Código Civil 1786.22 En California
(A) Una agencia de reporte del consumidor investigativo deberá proporcionar los archivos y la información requerida bajo la Sección 1786.10 durante el horario normal y con un preaviso razonable.
(B) Archivos mantenidos sobre un consumidor deberá estar disponible para la inspección visual del consumidor, de la siguiente manera:
– Personalmente, si aparece en persona y proporciona una identificación apropiada. Una copia de su expediente estará también a disposición del consumidor por un precio no superior a los costos actuales de servicios proveídos para duplicación.
– Por correo certificado, si se hace una solicitud por escrito, con identificación propia, para las copias que se enviarán a un destino especifico. Las agencias de reporte del consumidor investigativo que cumplan con las solicitudes de envíos certificados bajo esta sección no serán responsables por la divulgación a terceros que resulten por mal manejo de dichos correos después de dejar las agencias de investigación del consumidor.
– Un resumen de toda la información contenida en los archivos de un consumidor y requiere que se facilite bajo la Sección 1786.10 se facilitará por teléfono, si es que el consumidor hizo una solicitud por escrito con la identificación apropiada para obtener dicha información por medio telefónico, y en caso de que el consumidor llame por teléfono por cobrar a la agencia de informes del consumidor investigativas, los cargos serán transmitidos directamente al consumidor.
(C) El término “identificación adecuada” tal como se utiliza en la subdivisión (b), se entenderá que la información generalmente se considera suficiente para identificar a una persona. Dicha información incluye documentos tales como licencia de conducir válida, su número de seguro social, tarjeta de identificación militar, y las tarjetas de crédito. Sólo si el consumidor no puede identificarse razonablemente con la información descrita anteriormente, puede una agencia de reporte del consumidor investigativo requerir información adicional sobre el empleo del consumidor y de la historia personal o familiar con el fin de verificar su identidad.
(D) La agencia de reporte del consumidor investigativo deberá proporcionar personal capacitado para explicar al consumidor toda la información proporcionada al consumidor conforme a la Sección 1786.10.
(E) La agencia de reporte del consumidor investigativo deberá presentar una explicación por escrito de cualquier información codificada contenida en los archivos mantenidos en un consumidor. Esta explicación escrita se distribuye cada vez que un archivo se proporciona a un consumidor por inspección visual como se requiere bajo la Sección 1786,22.
(F) El consumidor se le permitirá ir acompañado de otra persona de su elección, que deberá presentar una identificación razonable. Una agencia de informes del consumidor de investigación puede requerir que el consumidor presente una declaración por escrito dando permiso a la agencia de informes del consumidor para discutir el expediente del consumidor en presencia de esa persona.
