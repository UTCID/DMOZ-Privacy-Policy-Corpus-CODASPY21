Bennett is not responsible for the handling of such information by these third parties who are responsible for their own privacy policies that would govern such collection, use and handling of this information. Bennett may also appoint third party agents in connection with its marketing and survey efforts, subject to a confidentiality agreement concerning the information. In any case, Bennett will not, without your consent, disclose any such personal information for use in connection with an unrelated third party’s marketing efforts.
Use. Bennett does not send unsolicited bulk emails or marketing-related communications to anyone who has requested that we not contact them. We send promotional information and communications only to those who have taken affirmative steps to subscribe to these communications or our existing registered customers, who have not unsubscribed or opted out of such communications. You may “opt-out” of our promotional use of your personal information (see 3 below).
If you have opted out of our promotional use of such personal information (see 3 below), Bennett will not use or disclose such information except as follows:

In some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, comply with retention obligations, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms and Conditions, we may retain in our files information you have requested us to remove, but such information is not actively used.
4. Collection, Use & Sharing of Passive & Other Information Beyond the Scope of Personal Information
Aggregate Information. Bennett may share aggregate statistical information with business partners, sponsors or other third parties without sharing your personal information. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women applied for extended service, but we would not disclose anything that uniquely identifies those individuals.
Cookies. Your browser software includes a feature called “cookies.” We may use “cookies” to enhance your experience with our site. If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to the Bennett Website, including your page preferences. Cookies tell us nothing about you personally, unless you specifically give us additional information. Cookies simply assist us in tracking which of our features you like best and what content you may have viewed during past visits. When you re-visit the Bennett Website, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: (i) keep count of your return visits to the Website; (ii) accumulate anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on website usage; (iii) deliver content specific to your interests or past viewing history; and (iv) save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites. You can also disable cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.
IP Addresses. An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. An Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) typically assigns a random dynamic IP address at the time of your dial-up. For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, a static IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. Bennett may record IP addresses of visitors to its Website. While an IP address may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. Other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses are never associated with Internet users.
Web Beacons. The Website may contain web beacons, which are electronic images (sometimes called “single-pixel gifs”) that allow us to count page views, or to access cookies. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing graphics that we may send to opt-in subscribers, to count the number of newsletters that have been opened and read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, or share any personal information about our website visitors. They are used only to compile our anonymous, aggregate statistics about website usage.
Computer Profiles. Bennett may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall website or Internet usage trends, as outlined in this Notice.
Geolocation. Bennett products and connected device applications may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Bennett product or connected device using a Bennett application in order to provide location-based services and features. Where available, geolocation features may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine the approximate location of your device and/or Bennett product. Unless you provide consent, this location data (if collected at all) is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Bennett, its affiliates and servicers generally to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your Bennett application may share the geographic location of your connected device or Bennett product with Bennett, its affiliates and servicers when you opt in to geolocation features within applications or Bennett products. Some geolocation features require combination with personal information in order to function. For example, some Bennett products with geolocation features are combined with product identification numbers that are tied to Personal Information.
Performance and Use of Your Bennett Product. Bennett products and connected device applications may collect, use, and share data related to your use of and the performance of your Bennett Product. This data (if collected at all) is collected either through your use of connected device applications or through diagnostic tools and is used by Bennett, its affiliates and servicers generally to provide more effective service and maintenance of your Bennett product, as well as to continue to provide and improve quality products, features and services.
