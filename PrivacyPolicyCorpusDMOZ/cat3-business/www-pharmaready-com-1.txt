HomePrivacy Policy
Introduction
Navitas’ Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our prospects, customers, business partners and the general public. This policy covers how Navitas handles the personal information it collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Navitas products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. Navitas, from time to time, may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. In that event, the changes will appear at this location.
Information Collection
Personal Information: Although most areas of our site can be accessed without submitting any information that personally identifies you, our Downloads Section requires the disclosure of certain personal information. If you have submitted personal information to Navitas and would like that information modified or deleted from our records, please contact us at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . We will use reasonable efforts to modify or delete your personal information from our existing files.
Sharing of Information: Navitas does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Navitas under confidentiality agreements. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Navitas’ terms of use or as otherwise required by law
We transfer information about you if Navitas is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Navitas will notify you once information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Security: All of Navitas’ employees and contractors are dedicated to maintaining and upholding your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. In addition, we have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information within our systems, Navitas cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
External Links and Third Party Sites: Navitas’ Web site contains links to other Web sites. Navitas is not responsible for the content of these Web sites or their privacy policies.
