What are your choices about the Personal Information collected?
When submitting information and interacting with our Sites, you choose which information you wish to share. Please take care to share only such information as is needed or that you believe is appropriate. Any promotional email we send to you will contain a link which will allow you to opt out of receiving any further correspondence. If you have created an online account, you may also change your correspondence preferences by logging into your account.
You may also opt out at any time from marketing communications by contacting us via our Contact Us form. You may disable your online account access at any time; however, this will not necessarily result in the deletion of any Personal Information.
You can also limit the use of tracking technologies, such as cookie collection which can be modified in browser settings on your device.
Use of cookies, web beacons and Google Analytics
Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign in, providing interest based advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform and fulfilling other legitimate purposes.
We also use "web beacons" to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies or similar technologies from third party service providers.
Our Sites may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by
Google, in order to better understand your use of our Sites and how we can
improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users
visit our Sites, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other
websites you used prior to coming to the Sites. Google Analytics collects
only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather
than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the
information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your
personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie
on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you
visit our Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's
ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about
your visits to the Sites is restricted by the
Google Analytics Terms of Service
and the
Google Privacy Policy. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the
Sites, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other
Google Sites. Google may use the data collected on the Sites to
contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To
more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Sites,
please review How Google Uses Information From Sites Or Apps That Use Our
Sites.
You can learn more about our use of cookies by reviewing our Cookie Notice.
How do you keep Personal Information secure?
Ghirardelli takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect
information transmitted via our Sites. Our Sites are scanned regularly for
security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your use of our
Sites as safe as possible.
Nevertheless, because no Sites are impenetrable, we cannot guarantee that
information that users of the Sites may transmit or otherwise supply will
be totally secure.
How long do you keep Personal Information?
We hold onto different types of data as necessary to provide the products
and fulfill the transactions you requested, or for another legitimate
purpose such as complying with legal obligations. Because
the needs vary based on different data types, retention periods may vary
significantly.
For example, we may keep information about you and how you use our Sites as
long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons,
and to prevent harm as described in the How We Use Information section.
Links to third party websites
For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on our Sites that link
to other websites not under our control. We are not responsible for, and
this Privacy Notice does not apply to, the privacy practices of those sites
or of any companies that we do not own or control.
Changes to this Privacy Notice
We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. You should visit our
website's privacy policy at https://www.ghirardelli.com/privacy-policy for the most up to date version of the Notice. If we make
material changes to this Notice, we will provide you with a more prominent
notice ahead of the Effective Date.
