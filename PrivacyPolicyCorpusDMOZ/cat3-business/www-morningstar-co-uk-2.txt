Can you please suggest good investment opportunities?
Morningstar is a provider of independent investment research and on our website you will find in-depth financial news, information and tools to help you to make informed investment decisions.  We do not provide financial advice.
Why can’t I find a specific fund?
Morningstar UK displays funds that are both registered and available for sale in the UK.  If the fund that you are searching for is registered and available for sale in the UK, please contact us via our feedback form stating the name and the ISIN code of the fund you are looking for.
How can I get a fund added to Morningstar's database?
In order to facilitate the data collection process, please send us any of the following fund information that you have available to you.
Fund name
Fund ISIN code
Domicile
Universe (e.g. Open-End, Close-End, etc)
Inception date
Latest prospectus
Once we receive the above information, we will then escalate your fund addition request to the corresponding Data Team for action. Our Data Analyst will then guide you through the next steps of the data collection process.
How can I update the information for the fund that I manage?
In order to change any information with regards to a fund, please send the correct information to us via the feedback form. Please include the link where you are viewing the data that needs to be amended.
Why does my fund’s style box differ from its category?
There might be a discrepancy between these two indicators of investment style, as they examine different time periods. The style box is intended to be a snapshot of a fund's portfolio at a specific moment in time and it only reflects the latest monthly holdings provided to Morningstar. A fund's category, instead, is meant to be a stable peer group which the fund can be compared with over the long term and it is based on an average of three and five years of portfolio data. Hence, a discrepancy between a fund's style box and its category indicates a change from a previous investment style that may or may not be temporary. When making historical performance comparisons, we suggest using the Morningstar category, while to determine the most current investment style of a fund, the Morningstar Style Box. For detailed information on this topic, please refer to the article “Why is my fund’s style box different from its category?”
Are fund returns adjusted for expenses and loads?
The fund returns you see on Morningstar.co.uk do include dividend payments and take into account annual charges for a fund's expense ratio. They show the real, post-expense return an investor would have made by purchasing a fund. However, returns are not adjusted for sales loads because not all of the investors in a given share class of a fund may be paying the same freight.
How do you calculate returns for ETF funds?
In order to calculate total and trailing returns for ETF funds we take into consideration their closing market prices, as these reflect what retail investors have to pay when they want to purchase ETFs.
Where can I find a research report for a fund?
In order to find an Analyst Research report, please enter the name of the investment in the Search box on the upper right side of the homepage and click on Go. You will then be redirected to the Morningstar Fund Report Overview for the fund. Please click on the Analyst Research option on the left side of your screen in order to find the Analyst Report for the fund. Alternatively, you can also select Tools from the main navigation bar and click on Morningstar Research Report Quickrank at the centre of the page. Using this option you will be able to find all of the funds with a Morningstar Fund Research Report.
Where can I find an explanation for a term that I do not understand?
Please take a look at our Glossary section, which you can access by clicking on the Glossary at the bottom of every page. If you can’t find the term, please let us know and we will consider adding it to the list.
How long does it take for a company release to be published on Morningstar.co.uk?
Every announcement is reflected the following day on the company’s news page, which you can access by clicking on the News tab from the stock navigation bar.
How can I search for a specific stock?
To research a specific stock, use the search box at the top of all Morningstar.co.uk pages to search by company name or ticker. Simply select your chosen stock from the dropdown list that appears and you'll be taken to that company's Stock Report. Let's take a look at BP (BP), for example: From BP's Stock Report you can access the oil major's share price performance chart, a synopsis of broker sentiment towards the stock, key ratios, and--for Premium subscribers--Morningstar's independent research report, including fair value estimate and financial health assessment.
How can I search equities by sectors?
To search for equities under the ICB sector classification, click on the “Equities” tab from the main tabs menu. You will then see a list of links in the middle of the page with the following headings: “Equity Tools”, “Corporate Actions” and “Daily Performance”. Underneath “Daily Performance” you will find the ICB sectors tab.
Alternatively you might use the “Equity Quickrank” tool. Click on the “Equities” tab from the main tabs menu, then “Equity Quickrank” from the central list of links underneath “Equity Tools”. Use the filters “All Sectors” and “All Industries” to come up with the desired list of companies.
How can I get the financial data (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Dividends) of a company?
Enter the name of the equity on the Morningstar search box (located at the top of the website) and select it from the dropdown menu. Once you are on the Overview page of the Morningstar Stock Report click on the “Financial” tab from the horizontal menu (between “Key ratios” and “Broker Sentiment”).
Initially you will see the summary page, click on any of the different tabs located on the subheader underneath “Financial” to get all the information for the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Dividends.
How can I get historical individual share price information?
Enter the name of the company in the Morningstar search box (located at the top of the website) and select it from the dropdown menu. Once you are on the Overview page of the Morningstar Stock Report click on the “Chart” tab (just next to “Overview”).
Select the time range from the top right corner of the chart and then move the cursor along the graph to get the date, price and volume from the top left corner of the chart.
Why is my Fund Performance Data in GBP?
Morningstar.co.uk is designed with UK-based investors in mind, who are therefore investing in pound sterling. To help investors better understand what is happening to their money in real terms, we show all fund returns in GBP. This facilitates a more meaningful comparison of funds' performance and ensures investors are able to ascertain the real cost or reward of each fund investment. This is the case whether the fund is traded in GBP or another currency.
If a fund's assets are held in a currency other than GBP, we convert the fund's performance into GBP using the WM/Reuters 4pm rate. We display returns in GBP in our data tables and are performance charts. Historical fund performance data is converted using the most current FX rate available on the day that the performance was registered. For month-end data, we use the FX rate available on the last day of the month in question.
If any data displayed is not in GBP, we will state which currency it is on the website.
What is Morningstar Premium?
Morningstar Premium is a new subscription-based investment research service dedicated to investors in the United Kingdom.  It aggregates some features already familiar to users of www.morningstar.co.uk, as well as introducing a number of new investment tools and data.  It also draws in the elements of the www.hemscott.com Premium service. Hemscott is a Morningstar company.
What are the benefits of signing up to Morningstar Premium?

Portfolio ManagerCreate up to 10 fund portfolios with holdings analysis functionality

Click here to see the full list of Premium features.
Can I expect to see additional features added to the service in the future?
Yes. Enhancements to our investor websites and Premium website are ongoing and in large part informed by user feedback. We encourage users to let us know how they use the service and what they would find useful in the future.
How does the Morningstar Premium service in the UK differ from Morningstar Premium services in other countries?
Each country offers content and tools that are tailored to the local investor audience. The Morningstar UK Premium service therefore emphasises funds available for sale in the UK, UK-specific data, and commentary that tackles the issues facing investors in the UK.
What Morningstar Premium price plans will be available?
Morningstar Premium will be available in monthly, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year plans; the longer plans will be offered at a lower average monthly price. Standard subscription to Morningstar Premium will cost £19, £159, £289 or £399, for the respective time periods.
I am an existing Morningstar.com (US) Premium subscriber. Should I also subscribe to Morningstar.co.uk Premium?
Morningstar.co.uk Premium will seek to offer a very similar service to that of Morningstar US. Both services source data and research centrally and use the same methodologies. Consequently, it would be useful for investors to subscribe to their local Premium service to be able to enjoy the most relevant securities, content and tools. However, Morningstar.co.uk Premium does not yet fully match the features of Morningstar.com Premium. If you are a Morningstar.com Premium subscriber and also wish to enjoy the benefits of Morningstar.co.uk Premium, please contact us to receive a 50% discount off the subscription price.
Why am I being asked to provide my credit card details at the beginning of the free 14-day trial period?
Providing your credit card details servers a couple of goals. Firstly, allowing us to confirm the authenticity of your details. Secondly, saving you the trouble of going through another registration process at a later stage. We reconfirm that we will NOT charge your credit card before the end of your 14-day trial period.
Can I enjoy the benefit of a free 14-day trial more than once?
You are entitled to a free 14-day trail every six months. This should allow you to explore any new Premium features that we have added since your last Premium subscription.
Will my trial subscription automatically convert to a paid-for subscription at the end of the trial period?
Yes, unless you choose to cancel your trial before the end of the trial period as described below.
Will my subscription automatically renew at the end of my current subscription?
Our subscribers tend to subscribe to Morningstar Premium for the long-term. We therefore automatically renew subscriptions. If you do not want your subscription to automatically renew, please contact Customer Support who will be happy to change your settings.
How can I cancel my trial or opt-out of auto-renewing an existing subscription?
Simply contact our Premium Support Team at 020 3194 1075, Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm at least two business days before the end of your trial period / current subscription.
Will I be notified once my subscription starts (i.e. trial period ends) or renews?
Yes, we will send you an email notification and attach the appropriate invoice (in PDF format) once payment has been taken.
If I take advantage of a discounted Premium subscription, how much will I be charged for when my subscription renews?
Any discounts only apply to the first subscription – any renewals will be charged at the standard rate at the time of the renewal. This is another reason to select a longer subscription period - you maximise the effect of the discount, on top of the inherent discount of a longer period subscription vs. a shorter one.
Why doesn't my fund have a Morningstar Rating?
There are a few reasons why a fund would not get a rating.
The fund is not three years old yet.
The fund’s rating has been suspended.
There are a few “convenience” categories that are not rated, because the group contains different funds with different risk factors. For example, Morningstar does not rate funds in the U.S. bear-market category or the Europe guaranteed category.
If the category is small, the sample may not be robust enough to calculate a rating. Morningstar requires at least five distinct portfolios in a category for a specific time period in order to calculate that rating.
Read more about the Morningstar Rating.
Why do two funds with similar performances receive different Morningstar Ratings?
The Morningstar Rating system is an objective mathematical evaluation of funds based on their past performance, which takes into account also their risk and sales load. A difference in risk and sales load can thus affect an investment rating.
Why is my fund rated differently according to the Morningstar Rating and the Morningstar Qualitative Rating?
The difference between our Morningstar Rating and the Morningstar Qualitative Rating is that the former mathematically rates investments based on how well they’ve performed in the past, so this is an objective measure; the latter reflects the assessment of a fund’s investment merits and its capacity to perform in the future, thus being a subjective statement. This is the reason why a fund can have a Morningstar Rating that is different to its Morningstar Qualitative Rating. Please find detailed information regarding the Morningstar Methodology used for our ratings in the Help section, which you can access by clicking on Help at the bottom of every page.
How often do you update the Morningstar Rating and the Morningstar Qualitative rating?
Our Morningstar rating is updated on a monthly basis. During the first days of the month we gather the information from the previous month and we calculate the rating based on that information. The Morningstar Qualitative rating shows our current rating for the fund regardless of the publication date of its qualitative report.
Morningstar Fund Quickrank Help: Rank Funds by Performance, Risk, Ratings
The Morningstar Fund Quickrank lets you screen and rank Morningstar.co.uk's database of funds. There are many versions of the Fund Quickrank: an Open-End Fund Quickrank, an ISA-eligible Fund Quickrank, a Life and Pension Fund Quickrank, an ETF Quickrank and an Investment Trust Quickrank, that includes close-end funds. Here is how you can use the Fund Quickrank: choose a Morningstar Category from the first pull-down list to see funds that are similar in investment strategy. Select a fund company from the Company Name drop-down list to see funds available from a particular investment manager. Select a universe from the All Funds drop-down to hone in on a type of fund. Enter a phrase in the text field to see all funds with that word in their name.  Click Go to see a list of funds that meet your criteria. Select a column heading to rank the display. If you wish to see additional data, click on Short Term, Performance, Portfolio or Fees & Details.
Morningstar Fund Screener Help: Screen Funds by Performance, Risk, Ratings, Portfolio Data
There are three versions of the Morningstar Fund Screener: an Open-End Fund Screener that includes open-end funds, ETFs, and ISA-eligible funds, a Life and Pension Fund Screener, and an Investment Trust Fund Screener. Here is how you can use the Fund Screener: find funds by selecting any or all of the criteria listed on the fund screener. Short descriptions of each datapoint are provided for easy reference, but you can also visit our glossary for more extensive information. After you have set up your search criteria, you can then run the screening by clicking the Search button. Within the results page, you can display your funds in one of five different views: Snapshot, Short-Term Performance, Long-Term Performance, Portfolio, and Fees & Details. This is an easy way to compare the funds without having to print out each fund's report.
Morningstar Fund Compare
This tool will allow you to compare information for up to five funds at a time. Please enter the name, ISIN or ticker of each fund in the Search box and you should immediately see the list of funds that most closely match what you have typed. Click on the fund you are looking for and you will get an overview of the fund. You can also run the search by clicking on the magnifying glass icon under the ‘Enter name or ISIN’ box.  This option will show you more parameters in order to screen for funds that you want to compare.  Once you have set up the criteria, please click on the Run symbol on the right of the lowest box. This will show you all of the funds corresponding to the parameters you have chosen. Select the fund you want to compare. You will then be able to compare all the funds according to five different categories: Key Statistics, Performance, Volatility, Portfolio and Operations.
How can I find an article that I read on Morningstar.co.uk?

How can I view a quick list of suitable investment products?
Morningstar’s ‘Quickrank’ tools allow you to quickly rank the investment vehicles in our database, whether it’s unit trusts, investment trusts, shares or ETFs that you’re looking for. We have a Quickrank tool for each asset type, links to which are located in the central column of the relevant tabs (OEICs/Unit Trusts, ETFs, Investment Trusts, Equities). You can also find all these tools on our Tools tab. Within these tools simply make your category or asset type selections, run the search, and rank the results by clicking on a header column such as ‘Performance’.
Why am I being asked to go to Morningstar.co.uk in order to manage my alerts?
Ever since Morningstar’s acquisition of the Hemscott businesses, we have been evaluating our current Hemscott service in conjunction with client needs and expectations. Our ultimate goal is to offer a top quality service for UK investors on Morningstar.co.uk. Migrating the News Alerts is one important milestone in the process.
Will I have to set up all my alerts on Morningstar again?
No. All your alerts on Hemscott.com have been automatically migrated over to Morningstar.co.uk. To view them, please login to the Morningstar Alerts Tool.
How do I access the Alerts tool on Morningstar .co.uk?
You can find the Morningstar Alerts Tool by clicking the ‘Alerts’ link at the top of the Equities section or the Tools section. You will be able to login with your Hemscott.com e-mail address as your username and your Hemscott.com password as your password.
I’ve forgotten my password. What should I do?
Please click ‘forgot your password?’ on the Membership page. Submit your e-mail address and instructions on how to reset your password will be sent to your inbox.
What are Morningstar's News Alerts?

How do I stop receiving alerts?
Visit the News Alerts page, and simply select the companies whose alerts you no longer wish to receive, then click "Delete".
Can I have alerts sent to a different email address other than the one I registered to Morningstar?
At present, alerts can only be sent to the email address that you have provided to Morningstar in your registration details. You can change this email address by editing your profile.
I can't find the company that I am looking for?
At present, you may only setup alerts for companies listed on the London Stock Exchange which have ordinary share capital.
Companies that are traded in the UK but registered abroad are not covered presently.
How can I get Dow Jones News and Regulatory News for companies?
Enter the name of the company in the Morningstar search box (located at the top of the website) and select it from the dropdown menu. Once you are on the Overview tab of the Morningstar Stock Report click on the “News” tab (between “Broker Sentiment” and “Owners”). Filter “All News” by clicking on the main heading (Dow Jones News or Regulatory News). Click on “Previous Stories…” underneath the last news item to read earlier stories.

You can then enter the name of the LSE listed company in the “Add a New Alert” blue box located at the bottom of the page and choose the type of alert (Price, News) you would like to set up.
If you wish to stop receiving the alerts, click on the green dot (on the right of the relevant alert) and it will become red (which will stop the alert) or tick the box next to the alert and then click “Delete” from the top left corner in order to delete the alert completely.
Why are my regulatory news and alerts delayed?
On Morningstar.co.uk, individual and professional investors can not only read regulatory news from the London Stock Exchange but can also set up alerts to receive the news by email. Due to changes made to the London Stock Exchange's RNS terms of agreement in April 2015, regulatory news and alerts on Morningstar.co.uk are available in real-time only to individual investors; professional investors will experience a delay of 60 minutes.
In order to provide professional investors with real-time regulatory news and alerts, Morningstar would be required to provide the LSE with the contact details (name, email, physical address, IP address, etc) of all professionals accessing real-time news, in addition to paying an extra fee to the LSE for professional access. Protecting the privacy and data of our customers is of paramount importance to Morningstar. We do not share customer details with any third party.
It is for this same reason that professional investors only have access to share prices that are delayed by 15 minutes on Morningstar.co.uk.
Alerts can be activated and deactivated in the Alerts Centre (login required).
Morningstar Portfolio Manager Help: track your investments by allocation or by specific transactions
Creating a New Portfolio. You can set up two different types of portfolios within the Morningstar Portfolio Manager: Watchlist portfolios are most useful if you just want to plug in a list of funds and their percentage allocations. These allocations will stay static for the life of the portfolio. Transaction portfolios are best when you wish to track investments and withdrawals specific to a given date. To start a new Portfolio, within Portfolio Manager click on Create. Please name your portfolio (50 characters maximum) and select a currency for your portfolio. We provide other options than the only British Pounds in case you are located outside the U.K. or you are investing in a different currency.
Watchlist Portfolios: allocate a Portfolio by Percentage or Current Value
When creating a Watchlist Portfolio, you can enter funds and specify their allocations. To add a fund, please start typing the fund name in the Holdings column and you should immediately see the list of funds that most closely match what you have typed. You could also type 'Cash' to add cash into your portfolio. By default, this screen accepts percentage allocations. However, if you prefer to enter amounts, just click the Allocation £ radio button. To delete a fund, select the tickbox to the left of the fund name, and click the Delete button at the top of the Holdings column. If you need to add more funds that the screen currently allows, just click the Add Entry Fields button at the bottom left hand of the screen. Note that you won't be able to move off this screen until your portfolio equals 100%.Once you have created your portfolio click on Save.
Transaction Portfolios: track specific Buy and Sell Portfolio Transactions
When creating a Transaction Portfolio, you can create specific buy and sell transactions. To add a fund, start typing the fund name, ticker or ISIN in the Holdings column and you should immediately see the list of funds that most closely matches what you have typed. Then, choose the type of transaction: select Buy or Sell and then enter the number of shares, the date, and the price. If you know you've paid a commission, go ahead and enter that too. To delete a fund, select the tickbox to the left of the fund name, and click the Delete button at the top of the Holdings column. If you need to add more funds that the screen currently allows, just click the Add Entry Fields button at the bottom left hand of the screen. Once you have created your portfolio click on Save.
How many portfolios can I create?
On Morningstar.co.uk you can create up to five different portfolios and each portfolio can have a maximum of one hundred holdings. If you have more holdings than that, you can track all of them by setting up more than one portfolio.
Where can I see profit and loss estimates since the date I purchased the funds?
For your information a profit and loss estimate since the date of purchase is available only in Transactional portfolios. Once you have finished creating the portfolio, please select the Gain / Loss tab from the Tracking section. The last two columns will show you the profit or loss you are realizing on each holding and an overall estimate for the portfolio.
How do I enter Dividends in Transaction Portfolios?
Within a Transaction Portfolio, you can enter dividend reinvestments. Note that dividends are not automatically reinvested by our Portfolio Manager and they must be entered manually. From the Edit tab in a Transaction Portfolio, choose Dividend. Please select the fund within your portfolio for which a dividend exists, using the drop down menu in the first Holdings column. Enter the date of reinvestment, and the amount and the price that has been reinvested. Example: you are paid out a dividend for Fund X (Holding) on 2010-06-30 (Purchase Date) that you would like to reinvest. The amount you wish to reinvest is £60 (Total Value Distributed), the price (Reinvest Share Price) is £17.69, and therefore you get 3.73 shares. To delete a transaction, select the tickbox to the left of the fund name, and click the Delete button at the top of the Holdings column. To add more lines, click the Add Entry Fields button at the bottom left. When you have entered the dividend reinvestments select Save at the bottom right of the page.
How do I enter Splits in Transaction Portfolios?
Within a Transaction Portfolio, you can factor in a split if it occurred in a fund. Note that splits are not accounted for automatically. From the Edit tab in a Transaction Portfolio, choose Splits. Please select the fund within your portfolio using the drop down menu in the first Holdings column. Enter the date the split occurred and the split ratio. For example, if you received 2 shares for every 1 share you owned, you would enter 2 for 1. To delete a transaction, select the tickbox to the left of the fund name, and then the Delete button at the top of the Holdings column. Please remember to save any changes done, clicking on Save at the bottom right of the page.
How do I enter Recurring Transactions in Transaction Portfolios?
Within a Transaction Portfolio, you can set monthly, quarterly or yearly transactions. Use this feature if you want to buy a bit of a fund on a regular basis. From the Edit tab in a Transaction Portfolio, select Recurring. Use the drop down menu in the first column to select the fund you have a recurring transaction for. Enter the date of the first transaction and the amount you wish to buy. After you have chosen the currency, select the frequency of the transaction: monthly, quarterly or yearly. To delete a fund, select the tickbox to the left of the fund name, and click the Delete button at the top of the Holdings column. To add more lines, click the Add Entry Fields button at the bottom left. When you have entered the recurring transactions, click Save.
Where can I see all of the recurring transactions I have entered for one of the holdings in my portfolio?
In order to see the full list of recurring transactions, please open your transaction portfolio, click on Edit and select Transactions. Please note that recurring transactions show on the Portfolio Manager the day after they have been entered.
What is the difference between total return and personal return?
For each transactional portfolio, within the Performance section you can find two types of returns, personal and total. Total return tells you how much your portfolio has increased or decreased in value over a given period. Personal return, by contrast, takes into account the timing of buy and sell transactions. Comparing your portfolio's total return and personal return can give you a good idea of how effectively you have timed sales and purchases. If you haven't made any transactions, the two returns will be the same.
Portfolio Subscriptions and Alerts
For all of your portfolios, you can sign up for two types of regular e-mail reports: Portfolio Updates and Email Alerts. Choose Portfolio Updates if you wish to receive regular performance updates as you can sign up for daily or weekly e-mail summaries. On the Portfolio Subscriptions page, please select a portfolio and indicate whether you would like daily or weekly performance updates. Choose E-mail Alerts if you wish to monitor if your portfolio(s) break certain business rules. For example, you can set up an alert that lets you know when the cash allocation of your portfolio goes over, or under, a specific limit. On the Portfolio Subscriptions page, please select a portfolio and then indicate the asset class that you would like to monitor. Select greater than or less than and type in a threshold. You will be notified by e-mail when a portfolio update from a fund company triggers this rule.

The Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks is assigned based on an analyst's estimate of a stocks fair value. It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar’s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company’s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar’s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here
