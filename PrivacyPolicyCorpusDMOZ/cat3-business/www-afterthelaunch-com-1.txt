PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.A “visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “member” is someone who has registered with us to use or buy our services and products. The term “user” is a collective identifier that refers to either a visitor or a member.Topics Covered in Our Privacy noticeInformation We CollectOur Use of CookiesHow Your Information Is UsedRetaining and Destroying Your PDUpdating Your PDRevoking Your Consent for Using Your PDProtecting the Privacy Rights of Third PartiesDo Not Track SettingsLinks to Other WebsitesProtecting Children’s PrivacyOur Email PolicyOur Security PolicyUse of Your Credit CardTransferring PD from the European UnionChanges to Our Privacy NoticeInformation We CollectGenerally, you control the amount and type of information that you provide to us when using our website.Our legal basis for collecting and processing your PD when you purchase our products or services is based on and the necessity for the performance of a contract or to take steps to enter into a contract.Our legal basis for collecting and processing your PD when you sign up for our newsletter, discounts, giveaways and more, is based on consent.What Happens If You Don’t Give Us Your PDIf you do not provide us with enough PD, we may not be able to provide you with all our products and services.
