Claims of Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by RMC (Rocky Mountain Connections Inc.) infringe the reader’s copyright (for example, materials posted by RMC (Rocky Mountain Connections Inc.) on one of our Forums), reader (or  agent) may send RMC a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow RMC (Rocky Mountain Connections Inc.) to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to RMC (Rocky Mountain Connections Inc.) 110 Midland Avenue, Basalt, CO, 81621, copyright@rmcdmc.com.
