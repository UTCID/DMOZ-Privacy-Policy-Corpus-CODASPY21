APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
The Terms of Use and any referenced Policies shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts regardless of conflict of laws principles and not by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in courts sitting in Boston, Massachusetts. You waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Except where prohibited, you agree that all disputes, claims and legal proceedings arising directly or indirectly out of or relating to the Site (including, but not limited to, the purchase of Rockport products) shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Site (including, but not limited to, the purchase of Rockport products) must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. You agree that any notice, agreement, disclosure or other communication that Rockport sends you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. Rockport's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of these Terms of Use shall not be considered a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall modify any of these Terms of Use. Rockport may assign its rights and duties under these Terms of Use to any party at any time without notice to you.
SEVERABILITY
If any provision in these Terms of Use is held invalid, the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue to be enforceable. If any provision in these Terms of Use is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and the remaining provisions are still valid and enforceable.
