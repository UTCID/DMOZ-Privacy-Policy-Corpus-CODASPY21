Terms of Use
By using the Troy Lee Designs® website you agree to be bound by its Terms of Use (explained below), Privacy Policy and all disclaimers and terms and conditions that may appear elsewhere on the TLD website.
References to Troy Lee Designs and/or TLD herein refer to Troy Lee Designs Inc., or their affiliates, subsidiaries and designees as deemed appropriate by Troy Lee Designs.
Troy Lee Designs reserves the right to make changes to the TLD website and its Terms of Use and Legal Notices at any time. Each time you use the TLD website, you should visit and review the then current Terms of Use, Legal Notices and Privacy Policy that apply to your transactions and use of this site. If you are dissatisfied with the TLD website, its content or Terms of Use and Legal Notices, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the TLD website.
Tampering with the site, misrepresenting the identity of a user, using buying agents or conducting fraudulent activities on the site are prohibited.
Disclaimers and limitation of Liability
By using the TLD website, you expressly agree that use of the TLD website is at your sole risk. The TLD website is provided on an “AS IS” and “as available” basis. Neither Troy Lee Designs nor its affiliates, subsidiaries or designees nor each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party content providers, designers, contractors, distributors, merchants, sponsors, licensors or the like (collectively, “Associates”) warrant that use of the TLD website will be uninterrupted or error-free. Neither Troy Lee Designs nor its Associates warrant the accuracy, integrity or completeness of the content provided on the TLD website or the products or services offered for sale on the TLD website. Further, Troy Lee Designs makes no representation that content provided on the TLD website is applicable to, or appropriate for use in, locations outside of the United States. Troy Lee Designs and its Associates specifically disclaim all warranties, whether expressed or implied, including but not limited to warranties of title, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. No oral advice or written information given by Troy Lee Designs or its Associates shall create a warranty. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
Under no circumstances shall Troy Lee Designs or its Associates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from your use of or inability to use the TLD website, including but not limited to reliance by you on any information obtained from the TLD website that results in mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion or corruption of files, viruses, delays in operation or transmission, or any failure of performance. The foregoing Limitation of Liability shall apply in any action, whether in contract, tort or any other claim, even if an authorized representative of Troy Lee Designs has been advised of or should have knowledge of the possibility of such damages. User hereby acknowledges that this paragraph shall apply to all content, merchandise and services available through the TLD website. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
Product Display/Colors
The TLD website attempts to display product images shown on the site as accurately as possible. However, we cannot guarantee that the color you see matches the product color, as the display of the color depends, in part, upon the monitor you are using.
Errors on Our Site
Prices and availability of products and services are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered, and Troy Lee Designs reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions including after an order has been submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, Troy Lee Designs will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may return it in accordance with Troy Lee Designs’ Shipping & Returns Policy.
Pricing Policy
Online prices and selection generally match those in stores, but may vary. Prices and offers are subject to change.
Sales Tax Policy
Troy Lee Designs collects and remits sales tax as required by U.S. law, for transactions in our stores and on troyleedesigns.com. If you’re a tax-exempt entity, Troy Lee Designs will gladly assist you with placing a tax-exempt order. Please call 1-800-239-6566. Troy Lee Designs reserves the right not to sell to resellers.
Paying for Your Order
You may pay for your orders with major credit cards issued in the United States of America. Currently, we accept Visa®, MasterCard®, American Express® and Discover® Card.
Generally, credit and debit card are not charged until we either ship the item(s) to you or confirm their availability (at which time you will be charged only for the goods we have actually shipped along with any appropriate taxes or shipping charges). However, we may pre-authorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When paying for a preorder with a debit card you will be charged at the time you place your preorder. Please contact your credit card issuer for more information.
If you ordered a special delivery item, you will be charged once a delivery time is confirmed.
Using Promotional Codes
Unlike credit or debit cards, Promotional Codes used on Digital Coupons are debited at the time an order is placed. Digital Coupons will automatically be redeemed to purchase totals, up to the total purchase amount. Digital Coupons must be used prior to their noted expiration date and within a single transaction. A coupon cannot be replaced if it is lost, stolen, deleted, or if you cancel or return your purchase. In the event of a reduction in price below the coupon value, the excess value of the coupon will not be refunded.
Validating Your Order
After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will check the information you give us for validity, by verifying your method of payment or shipping address. We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us, and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason. If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address and/or telephone number you have given us with the order. Your credit or debit card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a refund if the charge has been made against your card.
Order Limitations/Limited Quantities
Troy Lee Designs may, at its own discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. Troy Lee Designs also reserves the right to reject any order you place with us. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same TLD website account, the same credit card, and orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a change to an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address provided at the time the order was made. Troy Lee Designs reserves the right to limit or prohibit sales to dealers.
Termination of Use
Troy Lee Designs may, in its sole discretion, terminate your account or your use of the TLD website at anytime. You are personally liable for any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. Troy Lee Designs reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of the TLD website at any time without prior notice.
