PTSG helps safeguard buildings for Hammersmith & Fulham CouncilPremier Technical Services Group Ltd (PTSG) has been contracted to provide fire solutions for a large number of properties for Hammersmith & Fulham Council to help safeguard the buildings and their users.
Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council is one of 32 London borough councils. It is divided into 16 wards, electing a total of 46 councillors. It is among the four most sought after boroughs for residential properties in the United Kingdom, along with Kensington and Chelsea, the City of Westminster and Camden. It is unique in London in having three professional football clubs: Chelsea, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers.
Engineers from PTSG Fire Solutions Ltd are contracted to undertake the testing of dry and wet risers installed at well over 50 different sites. They make two visits per year to ensure they are operating to the required standards and to highlight and rectify any defects.
PTSG Fire Solutions Ltd is the fastest growing of the Group’s four divisions (the other three being PTSG Access & Safety Ltd, PTSG Electrical Services Ltd and PTSG Building Access Safety Ltd). It provides a full complement of fire detection and fire suppression services, as well as security solutions for clients in every industry sector.
