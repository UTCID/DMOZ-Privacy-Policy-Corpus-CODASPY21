Your privacy is respected by ExplicitlyYoursPencils.com.  Customer contact information has never been sold or shared.  Your financial information is not stored on our computers but rather on the payment gateway used. The credit card processor encrypts and protects your financial data.
Cookies are used to remember items in your shopping cart in case you leave and hopefully return.
Customers' names are never posted or released.  Over the past 16 years of business, we have proudly served all levels of government, famous individuals, celebrities, the entertainment industry, schools, high and low profile businesses, charities and lots and lots of families and children.
If you send us a great job email, we'll ask permission from you before it is posted online as a testimonial.  We love to receive those emails, and so far, we have resisted posting them on the website. We rely on word of mouth for referrals, so please, tell your friends about us.
