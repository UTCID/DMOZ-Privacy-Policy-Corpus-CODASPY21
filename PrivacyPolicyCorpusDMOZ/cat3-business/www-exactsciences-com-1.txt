Third Party Content and Links
Exact Sciences may make available links to websites operated by third parties, including advertisers.

Products, services, and content offered through linked websites are subject to the terms and conditions made available by those respective websites, and the data collection practices of linked websites will be governed by the respective privacy policies of those websites, not by ours. Following links to any other websites or web-based services is at your own risk, and any claims you have with respect to products, services, or content accessed through linked websites are claims against third parties, not against Exact Sciences.
Exact Sciences also may post or otherwise provide content of third parties (“Third Party Content”) as a service to those that might be interested in this information. Exact Sciences does not warrant, guarantee, or endorse the accuracy, completeness, legality, or innocuousness of any Third Party Content. Exact Sciences is not responsible for updating or reviewing Third Party Content. You use Third Party Content at your own risk.
The user agrees that Exact Sciences is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy, and does not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. The user agrees to not use any third-party materials in a manner that would infringe or violate the rights of any other party and that Exact Sciences is in no way responsible for any such use by the user.
