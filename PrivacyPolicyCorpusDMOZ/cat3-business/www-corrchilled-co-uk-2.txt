Our VAT number is 135 0181 50 and we operate www.corrchilled.co.uk (‘the Website’).
This page tells you information about us and the legal terms and conditions (Terms) on which we sell any of the products (Products) listed on the Website, or in our most recent published catalogue.
These Terms are only in the English language and will apply to any contract between us for the sale of Products to you (Contract). Please read these Terms carefully and make sure that you understand them, before ordering any Products from our Website or confirming orders placed over the telephone. Please note that before placing an order you will be asked to agree to these Terms. If you refuse to accept these Terms, you will not be able to order any Products from us.
At some points in these Terms we use the phrase ‘working days’, which means a day (other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday) when banks in London are open for business.
Order and Contract
The checkout pages of our Website, or our customer service team (if ordering by telephone) will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order with us. Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us, and you should take the time to read and check your order details at each or any stage of the order process.
After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received it and providing you with an order number (it is helpful if you quote this in all subsequent communication with us regarding your order and you must check yours and your order details are correct). However, please note that our acknowledgment does not mean your order has been accepted. Our acceptance of your order will take place when we send you a further e-mail confirming that your order has been checked, verified and confirmed (Order Confirmation). The Contract between us will only then be legally formed.
If before sending the Order Confirmation we are unable to supply you with a Product, for any reason (for example, unavailability, price or description errors, or delivery issues) we will inform you of this by e-mail and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Products, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible.Bottle Coolers Direct Ltd takes no responsibility for orders made in error. The customer must check they have ordered the correct unit for use with it's intended purpose. If an item has been ordered in error/the customer wishes to cancel the order, and the item has been despatched, the customer will incur re-stocking and carriage charges.
Products
The images of the Products on our Website, catalogues or brochures are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the images (for example, colours) accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display or printed pictures of them accurately reflect the Products entirely, and they may vary slightly.
Although we have made every effort to be as accurate as possible, all sizes, weights, capacities, dimensions and measurements indicated on our Website, catalogues and brochures have a 2% tolerance.
You are responsible for all unpacking, positions, erecting or installation of the Product(s) (unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by us) and for checking access suitability for the Product(s) ordered to any building.
Any orders that are cancelled due to products that are too large/small for site, will incur failed delivery and re-stocking charges.
Price and Payment
The price(s) of the Product(s) will be as quoted on our Website or most recent catalogue at the time you submit your order.
However our Website and catalogue contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products listed may be incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the Products you have ordered we will contact you to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing.
The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full.
You can only pay for Products using a debit or credit card (or BACS transfer if ordering over the telephone) or online payment merchant we accept or approved as listed on the Website during the checkout process.
Payment for the Products and all applicable delivery charges is in advance, unless explicitly agreed otherwise by us in writing. We may take payment before your order is dispatched, but this alone will in no circumstances constitute acceptance of your order on our part. In the event we are ultimately unable to accept your order, a full refund will be made to your payment card.
Delivery
When or as soon as reasonably possible after accepting your order, we will contact you with an estimated delivery date. Please note that delivery arrangements are made with and completed by third party couriers directly from our Product suppliers. Timescales for delivery, and delivery charges will therefore vary depending on the availability of Product(s) and/or the location they are to be delivered to.
Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control (and see clause 14 for details of what happens then). In addition, if we are not able to deliver all Products ordered at one time due to operational reasons, we will deliver the Products in instalments. We will not charge you extra delivery costs for this, and will let you know in advance of estimated delivery dates for each instalment.
Delivery of an Order shall be completed when we deliver the Products to the address you gave us, such other location as we may agree in writing, or you or a carrier organised by you collect them from us (including any passing to your courier for international delivery under clause 4.5). We shall only be required to deliver the Product(s) to a curb side ground floor location, and delivery to any third party nominated has the same effect as delivery to you for the purpose of the Contract.
You may place an order for Products from outside the UK, but (unless otherwise agreed by us in writing) this order must be for delivery to an address or loading in the UK by a freight or carriage provider you organise and pay for.
