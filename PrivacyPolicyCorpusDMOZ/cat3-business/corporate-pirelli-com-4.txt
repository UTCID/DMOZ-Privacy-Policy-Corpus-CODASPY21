Sustainability
Main sustainability policiesSocial responsibility policy for occupational health, safety and rights, and environment
"Pirelli Group activities are governed by the Code of Ethics approved by the Board of Directorsand comply with the Sustainability Model envisaged in the United Nations Global Compact thatwas signed in 2004."
- Social ResponsibilityPolicy for Occupational Health, Safety and Rights, and Environment.-
The Pirelli Group pursues and supports compliance with internationally proclaimed human rights.
By publishing its "Health, Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility Policy" (HSE & CSRPolicy), signed by the Chairman in June 2004, Pirelli has; internally diffused and at the same time strengthened its guarantee for a correct balance between sustainability and industrial development.
This policy was amended between the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010 and the "name" of the Policy has also been changed to "Social Responsibility Policy for Occupational Health, Safety and Rights, and Environment."
The new version specifically mentions Pirelli's firm adherence to the international rules that also constitute the basis for the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
As in the previous version of 2004, the commitments made by Pirelli through the Policy respect and support the "Universal Declaration of HumanRights", the "International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles andRights at Work," the "Rio Declaration on Environment and Development" and the "United NationsConvention against Corruption" and also reflect the obligations set out in the Standard SA8000®.
The updated version of the Policy has been distributed to all Group employees through a specific internal communication campaign during the first several months of 2010.
Besides group suppliers are formally required to comply with the Policy, by signing the "sustainability clauses" included in the supply contracts.
