Protecting your privacy - Transpack Ltd
Transpack Limited
This Privacy Notice explains what types of personal data we may collect about you when you interact with us., how we’ll store that data to keep it safe, and how we will use it. It also explains your rights in relation to that data. Any changes to this policy will be available to see via our website.
Transpack Limited – which we’ll refer to as ‘Transpack’ in this document – is a private Company registered in England No. 3392522
The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:
Consent - when you tick a box to confirm you are happy to receive communication from us
Contractual obligations - if you place an order with us, we will need to process your data in order to fulfil your order.
Legal Compliance - if the law requires it we can pass on your data to law enforcement agencies if we suspect fraud or other criminal activities
Legitimate Interest - in specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business eg. Using your purchase history to send you relevant offers
We collect your data:
When you visit our website and use your account to buy products and services.
When you create an account with us.
When you purchase a product or service from our warehouse or by phone but don’t have (or don’t use) an account.
When you engage with us on social media.
When you sign up to My Account, you will be given access to an area on Transpack. This will collect and store all your order history allowing you to reorder quickly.
When you contact us by any means with queries.
When you ask one of our Staff to email you information about a product or service.
When you comment on or review our products and services.
When you fill in any forms. For example, opening a Trade Account with us.
When you’ve given a third party permission to share with us the information they hold about you.

What sort of personal data do we collect?
If you have a web account with us: your name, title, billing/delivery address, orders and receipts, email and telephone number.
For your security, we’ll also keep an encrypted record of your login password – this allows you to log in and see your previous order details.

For example, we collect notes from our conversations with you, details of any complaints or comments you make, details of purchases you made, items viewed or added to your basket, wish list choices, voucher redemptions, web pages you visit and how and when you contact us.
Details of your visits to our website, and which site you came from to ours
Information gathered by the use of cookies in your web browser. Learn more about How we use Cookies.
Your comments and product reviews.
Payment card information if you order over the phone. This is then destroyed after the transaction is complete. (Payment via our website is through a secure third party company which means that payment information is not visible to us, and not collected).
To deliver the best possible web experience, we collect technical information about your internet connection and browser as well as the country and telephone code where your computer is located, the web pages viewed during your visit, the advertisements you clicked on, and any search terms you entered.
Your social media username, if you interact with us through those channels, to help us respond to your comments, questions or feedback.
How and why do we use your personal data?
We want to give you the best possible customer experience and to be able to offer you any relevant information regarding new products or special offers. One way to achieve that is to look at your order history, which allows us to only contact you when it is totally relevant.
The data privacy law allows this as part of our legitimate interest in understanding our customers and providing the highest levels of service.
Here’s how we’ll use your personal data and why:
To process any orders that you make by using our website, or over the phone. If we don’t collect your personal data during checkout, we won’t be able to process your order and comply with our legal obligations.
To respond to your queries, refund requests and complaints. Handling the information you sent enables us to respond. We may also keep a record of these to aid any future communication with us and to demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We do this on the basis of our contractual obligations to you, our legal obligations and our legitimate interests in providing you with the best service.
To protect our business and your account from fraud and other illegal activities. This includes using your personal data to maintain, update and safeguard your account. We’ll also monitor your browsing activity with us to quickly identify and resolve any problems and protect the integrity of our websites. We’ll do all of this as part of our legitimate interest.
To process payments and to prevent fraudulent transactions. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests. This also helps to protect our customers from fraud.
With your consent, we will use your personal data, preferences and details of your transactions to keep you informed by email, web, telephone or post and through customer services about relevant products and services including tailored special offers, discounts and , promotions. Of course, you can opt out of these communications at any time.
To send you communications required by law or which are necessary to inform you about our changes to the services we provide you. For example, product recall notices, and legally required information relating to your orders. These service messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email. If we do not use your personal data for these purposes, we would be unable to comply with our legal obligations.
To display the most interesting content to you on our website, we’ll use data we hold about your favourite brands or products and so on. We do so on the basis of your consent to place cookies or similar technology on your device.
To comply with our contractual or legal obligations to share data with law enforcement.
To send you feedback requests to help improve our services. These messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email. We have a legitimate interest to do so as this helps make our products or services more relevant to you.
Of course, you are free to opt out of receiving these requests from us at any time by unsubscribing when you receive an email.
How we protect your personal data?
We will treat your data with the utmost care and take all appropriate steps to protect it.
We secure access to all areas of our website using ‘https’ technology.
Access to your personal data is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as payment card information) is secured by SSL encryption. Online payments are only handled by a third party card handling company through a fully encrypted site attached to this one. None of our staff have sight of your card details when you order online.
Who do we share your personal data with?
We sometimes need to share your personal data with trusted third parties. This could be delivery couriers or technicians visiting your premises. We will provide only the information they need to perform the specific services, they may only use your data for those services.
Sharing your data with third parties for their own purposes:
We will only do this in very specific circumstances, for example:
For fraud management, we may share information about fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activity in our premises or systems. This may include sharing data about individuals with law enforcement bodies.
We may also be required to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body, in your country of origin or elsewhere, upon a valid request to do so. These requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis and take the privacy of our customers into consideration.
We may, from time to time, expand, reduce or sell the Company and this may involve the transfer of the whole business to new owners. If this happens, your personal data will, where relevant, be transferred to the new owner or controlling party, under the terms of this Privacy Notice.
To help personalise your journey through Transpack’s website we use various third party companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter who will process your personal data as part of their contracts with us.
International orders
If you are based outside the UK and place an order with us, any data collected from you will be processed by our UK office.
Protecting your data outside the EEA
We may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third-party data processors in countries that are outside the EEA. For example, this might be required in order to fulfil your order. If we have to do this we will ensure your data is protected and treated in line with this Privacy Policy.
You have the right to:
Access the personal data we hold about you – there is usually no charge for this
The correction of your personal data when incorrect, out of date or incomplete.
Request that we stop using your personal data for direct marketing (either through specific channels, or all channels).
