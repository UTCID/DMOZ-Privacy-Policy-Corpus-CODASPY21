Termination. Any action by you that, in Ariens' sole discretion: (i) violates these Terms of Use and/or the Privacy Policy; (ii) restricts, inhibits or prevents any access, use or enjoyment of the Services by third parties or Ariens; or (iii) through your use of the Services, defames, abuses, harasses, offends or threatens any third party, shall not be permitted, and may result in your loss of the right to access and use the Services and/or termination of any account you may have on the Services.
