Shortages
Claims for shortages must be made within 30 days from the date of shipment. Claims made after 30 days will not be considered.
Shipping & Freight
All orders ship F.O.B. Garfield, New Jersey.
United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx are the package services used by WaferSeals.com. Expedited methods of freight are also available, such as next day air, and second day air. Please specify the shipping method when ordering, or WaferSeals.com will ship the least expensive method, regardless of delivery time.
WaferSeals.com is not responsible for lost or damaged freight. All packages are insured when they leave WaferSeals.com. If a package is damaged in shipment, you should not accept the package without appropriate documentation of damage. WaferSeals.com will be happy to work with you and the carrier to secure a settlement for damaged freight provided proper documentation has been made on receipt. Failure to document damage will make it impossible to secure an insurance claim on your behalf.
