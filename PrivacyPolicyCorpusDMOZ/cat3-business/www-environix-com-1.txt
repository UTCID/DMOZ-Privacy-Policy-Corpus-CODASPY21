Privacy Policy
Environix.com uses 3rd party vendor remarketing tracking cookies, including the Google AdWords and Analytics tracking. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Environix uses cookies to identify and track visitors, their usage of the Environix website, their website access preferences, and help to improve the visitor’s experience overall.
Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Environix.com website. This means that, for example, Environix advertises to previous visitors (or similar audiences) who haven’t completed a task on the site i.e. using the contact form to make an inquiry. This allows Environix to make special offers and continue to market directly to those who have shown interest in their service. This remarketing could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, a site in the Google Display Network, or another 3rd party site.
Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with both Environix’s and Google’s privacy policy. Environix respects your privacy and are not collecting any identifiable information using Google’s or any other 3rd party remarketing system.
If you do not wish to see remarketing ads from Environix you can opt out by:
1. Visiting Google’s Ads Settings and opt out of Google’s use of cookies.
2. Visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.”
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Environix may change its Privacy Policy from time to time at Environix’s sole discretion. Your continued use of this site after any change in Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
