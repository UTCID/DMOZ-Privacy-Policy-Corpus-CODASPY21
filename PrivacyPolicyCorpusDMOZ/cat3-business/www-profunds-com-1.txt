Business Continuity Plan
ProFunds has a flexible Business Continuity Plan ("BCP") to respond to events that significantly disrupt business. ProFunds' BCP is designed to enable quick recovery and resumption of business operations after a significant business disruption ("SBD") by safeguarding employees and property, making financial and operational assessments, and protecting books and records so ProFunds can continue to transact business.
ProFunds' BCP addresses the following areas: data back-up and recovery; all mission-critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communication methods with business constituents, employees, and regulators; alternative physical location for critical employees; service providers; and regulatory reporting. Back-up records are maintained electronically, and certain documentation is secured off site. While every emergency situation poses unique problems, it is ProFunds' and its technology service providers' objectives to restore all services as soon as possible.
SBDs vary in scope and severity. They may disrupt operations solely at ProFunds, or they may affect a larger area. Should an SBD occur applying solely to ProFunds' primary place of business, the firm will transfer operations to an off-site location and generally resume business the same day. If a larger area is disrupted, ProFunds will transfer operations to a site outside of the affected area and generally resume business within 24 hours. ProFunds will notify you of any necessary information through ProFunds.com.
This BCP is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and is subject to change. For more information, or if you have questions about the BCP, please contact ProFunds at 888-PRO-FNDS (888-776-3637) or through ProFunds.com.
