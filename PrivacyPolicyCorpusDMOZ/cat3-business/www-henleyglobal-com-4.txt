IP Address and Cookie Policy
Please read the following carefully to understand how and why this Website uses your IP address and cookies. You must give your express consent in order to access and browse our website https://www.henleyglobal.com (“the Website”). If you do not accept the provisions of this Policy, you must exit our Website immediately.
Last Updated: May 2018
(hereinafter, the “IP and Cookie Policy”).
Henley and Partners Group Holdings Limited (”We”, “Us” “Our” or “Henley”) (C 58006) collects two types of information about you resulting from your use of its website, (the “Site”): (i) personal information, including your name and e-mail address and (ii) aggregate information, this being generated from the practices which We have in place in relation to ‘cookies’ and the Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”) of its users.
Our practices in relation to the collection and processing of such personal information are set out in our privacy policy.
Correspondingly, the practices which we have in place regarding the generation of aggregate information (as mentioned above) are described here in our IP and Cookie Policy. In order to be able to browse and use the Website, as well as the online platform which you, the user, are connected to by means of the Website, you must expressly agree to the practices set out herein.
(A)  IP Address
What Happens When You Visit the Website
Every time you connect to the internet or, if you use an always-on connection, such as broadband or ADSL, when you boot up or restart your computer, you are automatically assigned a unique identifying number known as an IP Address. This IP Address, which contains information regarding the location of your computer on the internet (your country of origin) and the name of your internet service provider (“ISP”), is automatically logged by our Website.
What is an IP Address?
When you first started your internet session (i.e. your computer connected to the internet), your computer was automatically assigned a unique number (normally in the region of 9 or 10 decimal numbers), known as an IP Address. This is your computer’s unique address on the internet. Without such an IP Address, websites would not be able to deliver their content to you as they would not be able to find your computer on the internet. Since each time you disconnect and reconnect to the internet a new IP Address is automatically assigned to your computer, IP Addresses are not inherently capable of identifying you as an individual (at least, by themselves).
An IP Address does, however, contain information regarding the location of your computer on the internet (your country) and the name of your ISP.
How Do We Collect Your IP Address
Each time you visit a page on our Site, your computer sends out a message to our Site asking for the content. This message sent by your computer also encloses your IP Address as a form of “return address” so that the Site may find your computer in order to send it the requested content. Our web-server automatically logs all these messages.
What Do We Do With Your IP Address?
When we log your IP Address, the data collected is grouped up with the other logged IP Addresses in order to provide us with the statistics on the geographic location of visitors to our Site, how long they stay on our Site, which are the most viewed pages and for other statistical reasons.
We gather your IP address automatically and store it in log files. These files also contain information relating to your browser type, ISP, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data and the files viewed on our Site. Collecting this type of information allows us to generate aggregate information for the purposes of our Site, including in terms of overall user trends and activities online (such as the number of unique visitors, pages access most frequently or the search terms entered). It also allows us to administer our Site, diagnose any potential server problems, analyze visitor trends and statistics, and generally held us to provide you with a better internet experience. IP Addresses are not stored for longer than necessary for the above stated purposes.
