Our Services
Insurance-related:  PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO ANY INSURANCE OR OTHER TRANSACTION. We do not offer or sell any insurance or other products described on the Site. Instead, the Site acts as a venue to allow insurance companies, insurance agents and other parties who are customers of our Site (each, a “Provider”) to offer for sale and sell, in a variety of formats, insurance and other authorized products to potential consumers (each, a “Prospect”, and all Prospects and Providers are collectively called the Site’s “users”) who have visited one of our affiliated sites and applied to receive insurance or other authorized quotations from a Provider (the “Service”). We are not involved in the actual transaction between any Prospect and any Provider even though we may, through our affiliate sites, and with each Prospect’s authorization, collect certain information (collectively, a “Lead”) about any Prospect and sell such Lead to a Provider. As a result, the quality, safety or legality of the products offered by any Provider for sale, the truth or accuracy of the representations regarding such products, the ability of Providers to offer or sell such products or the ability of Prospects to pay for the products offered are solely the responsibility of each user. We are an independent contractor for all purposes. Importantly, we do not issue insurance contracts or bind coverage. We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of any Prospect or Provider. We do not endorse or recommend any companies or insurance policies. We do not provide insurance, tax, legal or any other financial advice. We do not guarantee that any of the Providers to whom we forward any Prospect’s application will contact such Prospect or agree to provide the Prospect with the desired coverage. If you are a Prospect and you would like personal advice or specific policy recommendations, please consult with an insurance agent, broker or other qualified professional.
Loan related:  iLeads.com (and its family of websites) are a marketing lead generator. iLeads.com does not take applications, make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans, nor does iLeads.com issue commitments or lock-in agreements. iLeads.com services are only administrative. Any loan inquiry you submit is NOT an application for credit, it is an inquiry to be matched with Lenders to receive condition loan offers from them. You have not been pre-approved, pre-qualified or any similar concept by submitting an inquiry form to us. You may have to complete an application with a Lender and may require you to pay an application or other fees to cover the costs of an appraisal, credit report or other items, before they will extend an unconditional offer. At closing, you will be responsible for paying any settlement or closing costs associated with your loan. iLeads.com is paid a marketing lead generation fee by lenders for the services provided, depending on the lender the marketing lead generation fee paid by the lender may be included in your rate, points or loan terms. iLeads.com is not the lender, agent or broker and does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular Lender.
You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms, and Lender best suits your needs and financial means. The Lender is solely responsible for its services to you, and you agree that iLeads.com shall not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of such services. You understand that Lenders may keep your loan request information and any other information provided by iLeads.com or received by them in the processing of your loan request, whether or not you are qualified for a loan with them or if you make a loan with them. You agree to notify any particular Lender directly if you no longer want to receive communications from them.
The Websites and the services provided by iLeads.com may only be made available to residents of or secured by real property located in, states where Lenders are licensed or authorized to make such loans.

iLeads.com does not guarantee acceptance into any particular loan program or specific loan terms or conditions with any Lender; loan approval standards are established and maintained solely by individual Lenders and iLeads.com does not guarantee that the loan terms or rates offered and made available by Lenders are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. A Lender’s offer may be subject to market conditions, approval, and qualification. The rates and fees actually provided by Lenders may be higher or lower depending on your complete credit profile, collateral/property considerations including but not limited to location, equity and value and income/asset consideration including, but not limited to the loan to value and debt to income ratios. You might not be matched with the Lender making any specific offer. To help the government fight identity theft, the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify your identity, Lenders may obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account with us and them. Lenders may ask for your name, Social Security Number, address, telephone number, date of birth and other important information including, but not limited to information received from your credit file, that will allow them to properly identify you. During the Lender application process, they may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documentation to further properly identify you.
