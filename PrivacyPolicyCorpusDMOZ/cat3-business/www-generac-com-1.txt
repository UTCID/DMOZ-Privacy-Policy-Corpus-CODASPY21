COLLECTION OF OTHER INFORMATION

Cookies (or browser cookies) and web beacons
A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the System, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience.  We also gather statistical information about use of the System in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the System.  We may also use cookies or other technologies in online advertising to track responses to our ads.  We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.
You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. You may also wish to refer to https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our System.
