Applicable law may not allow the limitation of exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
Typographical Errors
In the event that a Service Spring product is mistakenly listed at an incorrect price, Service Spring reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. Service Spring reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, Service Spring shall issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.

These terms and conditions are applicable to you upon your accessing the site and/or completing the registration or shopping process. These terms and conditions, or any part of them, may be terminated by Service Spring without notice at any time, for any reason.

Service Spring's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these terms and conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these terms and conditions.

Third-Party Links
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Service Spring may link to sites operated by third parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Service Spring, Service Spring has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Service Spring. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Service Spring seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).
