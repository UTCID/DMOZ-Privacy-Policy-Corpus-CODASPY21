Privacy and Cookie Policy
WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS
This policy covers personal information that we receive when you use the threadcheck.com website. “Personal information” is information that can be linked to you as an individual, such as your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number. By visiting and using threadcheck.com, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.
INFORMATION YOU KNOWINGLY GIVE TO US
We receive and may store any personal information you actively send us or enter on our website. You provide such information when you fill out a contact or lead form, request a free trial or send us e-mails.
INFORMATION THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED BY OUR SYSTEM
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through the internet. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to allow our system to recognize your browser and to provide you certain browsing conveniences. You can configure your browser to reject cookies, but if you do so, you might not be able to experience all the functionality and conveniences of our website.
GOOGLE ANALYTICS
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about the use of threadcheck.com. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they visited prior to coming to this website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to maintain and improve the website’s technical performance. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of service, available at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html, and the Google Privacy Policy, available at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser. Please note that on this website, Google Analytics code is supplemented by “anonymizeIp” to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.
WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We use the personal information that we receive to operate the website and to fit your needs and demands for using our products and services. We do not rent or sell your personal information to any entity. We do not share your personal information with any entity, except when:
We have your permission; or
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes; or when we must exercise our legal rights, protect our property, defend against legal claims, or otherwise comply with the law; or
We believe it is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud, threats to personal safety, or violation of this website's terms of use.
Threadcheck.com may at times contact you at your email address to keep you informed about the latest news or developments. Should you not want to receive such communications, you will find details about how to opt out the first time you are contacted.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
The only people, who have access to personal information collected on this web site, either directly, or through use of Google Analytics, are employees and our marketing agency who have a need to know and who are bound by nondisclosure agreements and this privacy policy. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we store. Please note that the threadcheck.com website may contain links to third party websites. These third party websites may send their own cookies to collect data and solicit personal information. Therefore, we cannot guarantee your privacy when visiting such third party sites, nor the accuracy or acceptability of any services provided by such third parties.
