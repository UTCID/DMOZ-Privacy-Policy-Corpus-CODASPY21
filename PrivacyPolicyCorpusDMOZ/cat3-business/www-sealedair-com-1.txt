Updated: August 24, 2018
Sealed Air Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“we”, “us” or “our”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the information about you that we collect on Sealedair.com and any of our other websites that link to this Privacy Policy (each, a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, made subject to and is governed by, our Web Site Terms of Use (the “Terms”).
This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect via the Sites, how we may use such information, with whom we may share such information, and what we do to protect such information. We also tell you how you can reach us to ask us to update your preferences regarding how we communicate with you, or answer any questions you may have about this Privacy Policy.
If you access any of our Sites in the scope of your employment or otherwise in connection with your responsibilities to your employer, our collection and use of your information may be governed by, and subject to, a separate agreement between us and your employer, instead of this Privacy Policy. You should confirm with your employer whether any such separate agreement exists that governs our collection and use of your information. To the extent there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and another agreement between Us and you, that agreement shall prevail.
A. GENERAL POLICY

Cookie Settings
Personal Information: When you use any of the Sites, you may provide to us (and, if so, we will collect) information including your name, e-mail address, telephone number, the country in which you are located, your company name, and your job level (hereinafter “Personal Information”).  Below is a description of the types of information we collect through the Sites:
Cookies & Automatically Collected Information: When you visit our Sites, we use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to collect certain information about you.  Cookies are small files that websites and email servers place and access on your computer or other Internet-connected devices to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store information or settings in your device.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict, disable or delete certain cookies.  Please note, however, that without certain cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.
Our web servers log information such as your device and operating system type, browser type, domain, device ID, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.  The web server logs also record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.
To control which web servers place and access cookies and collect information automatically, we place tags on our webpages called “web beacons”, which are small files that allow us to understand the actions of visitors to our Sites.  We use similar technology in marketing emails we send, which may enable the placing or accessing of cookies, and also enable us to know if you received the email, if the email was opened and if you clicked on any links included in the email.
You can learn more about our use of cookies, and disable or opt-out of any cookies or other automatic information collection at any time, by visiting our Cookie Consent and Preference portal above.

Information about your activities on our Sites is collected for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests on other websites and online services.  You may choose whether to have your information collected for that purpose.  We participate in advertising services administered by third-parties.  These ad services track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the automated technologies described above, and such ad services may use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests and/or based on prior visits to our Sites.  We and our third-party service providers use first-party cookies and third-party cookies alone or together, as well as other automated means, and the data collected through such means and from other sources to: (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads (including ads based on past visits to our Sites), and (ii) report on our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services (including how they are related to visits to our Sites).
