MJI is not responsible for any materials posted to this Site(s) by any third parties. However, MJI reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in MJI's sole discretion are objectionable or in violation of these Terms, MJI's policies, or applicable law.
You agree not to link from any other website to any of the Site(s) in any manner such that the Site(s), or any page of the Site(s), is not viewable in its entirety in a User interface, "framed," surrounded or obfuscated by any third party content, materials or branding. We reserve the right to revoke Your right to link to the Site(s) from Your website at any time upon written notice to You.
As between You and MJI, You own and are entirely responsible for any data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, images, videos, messages, or other content or materials (collectively, "User Content") that You may submit, transmit, upload, post, email, or otherwise make available on or through any of the Site(s). All User Content is and will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You acknowledge and agree that You waive any moral (or similar) rights that You may have in any territory in respect of User Content, including but not limited to the right to be attributed as the author of the User Content and the right not to have the User Content edited or changed in a way You are not happy with.
By providing MJI and/or the Site(s) with User Content, You hereby grant to MJI and its affiliates, representatives, and assigns, a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, license and permission to use, copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, transmit, display, print, publish, distribute and perform any and all of Your User Content (in whole or in part) in connection with the Site(s) and/or to incorporate Your User Content in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, without further consent or notice to you, including for promotional and commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do all or any of the foregoing. You acknowledge and agree that You have no expectation of compensation or confidentiality of any nature with respect to any User Content. We may exercise these rights without notice to You and without paying any compensation to You. MJI reserves the right to display advertisements in connection with Your User Content and to use Your User Content to advertise and promote Your User Content, the Site(s), and MJI and its products. MJI reserves the right to modify User Content in its sole and absolute discretion. MJI is not required to host, display, or distribute any User Content, and may remove, delete or destroy any User Content at any time and for any reason or no reason in MJI’s sole discretion.
You represent and warrant that: (a) Your User Content is original to You, no other party has any rights thereto, and You own all rights in Your User Content (including, without limitation, all rights to the audio, video, or digital recording, and the performance contained in Your User Content) or, alternatively, You have acquired all necessary rights in Your User Content to enable You to grant to MJI the rights in Your User Content described herein; (b) Your User Content is not confidential or secret, and no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between You and Us; (c) You have paid and will pay in full all license fees, clearance fees, and any other financial obligations, of any kind, arising from any use or commercial exploitation of Your User Content; (d) You are the individual pictured or heard in Your User Content, or, alternatively, You have obtained permission from each person (including consent from parents or guardians for any individual under the applicable age of majority) who appears or is heard in Your User Content to enable You to grant the rights to MJI described herein; (e) You will make such permissions available to MJI upon request; (f) Your User Content does not violate, misappropriate or infringe any copyright, trade secret, trademark, privacy right, publicity right or other intellectual property right of any other third party and that any “moral rights” in Your User Content have been waived; and (g) Your User Content complies with these Terms. You agree to keep all records necessary to establish that Your User Content does not violate any of the foregoing representations, warranties and promises and to make such records available to MJI upon MJI’s request.
You further agree that MJI and its affiliates are free to use for any purpose whatsoever, ideas, know-how, concepts, techniques, comments, criticisms, reports, or other feedback other than User Content (“Feedback”), whether oral or written, that You may send to MJI or its affiliates. You acknowledge and agree that (i) You have no expectation of compensation or confidentiality of any nature, and that MJI has no duties to You, with respect to such Feedback, and (ii) MJI has the right (but not the obligation) to use such Feedback for any purpose without notice to You and without paying any compensation to You. All Feedback is and will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.
MJI reserves the right, but does not have an obligation, to monitor and/or review User Content. MJI does not endorse or control the User Content transmitted or posted on the Site(s) and therefore MJI is not responsible for User Content and MJI does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of User Content, which may not necessarily reflect the views of MJI. You understand that by using the Site(s), You may be exposed to User Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable to You. Under no circumstances will MJI be liable in any way for any User Content, including, without limitation, for any errors or omissions in any User Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred by You as a result of the use of or reliance on any User Content submitted, transmitted, uploaded, posted, emailed, or otherwise made available via the Site(s). MJI has no control over User Content once it leaves the Site(s), and it is possible that others may duplicate User Content on other sites on the Internet.
You acknowledge that MJI has the right – though not the obligation – in Our sole discretion to refuse to post or remove any User Content and it reserves the right to change, condense, edit, modify, transmit, display, or delete any User Content and You waive any rights You have in having the material altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to You. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms, MJI has the right to remove any User Content that violates this User Generated Content Policy or is otherwise objectionable, and We reserve the right to refuse service and/or terminate access without prior notice for any User who violates these Terms or infringes the rights of others.
You agree that if You include a link from any other website to marcjacobs.com or to any of the Site(s), such link shall open in a new browser window. You agree not to link from any other website to marcjacobs.com or to any of the Site(s) in any manner such that the Site(s), or any page of the Site(s), is "framed," surrounded or obfuscated by any third party content, materials or branding. We reserve the right to revoke Your right to link to the Site(s) from Your Web site at any time upon written notice to You.
MJI reserves the right to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or government request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in MJI’s sole discretion are objectionable or in violation of these Terms, MJI’s policies or applicable law.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a restriction on or waiver of any consumer’s right to make any statement regarding MJI or its employees or agents, or concerning MJI’s goods or services.
Unless specifically requested, We do not solicit nor do We wish to receive any confidential, secret, or proprietary information, or other material from You through the Site(s), by email, or in any other way. Any information, creative works, demos, ideas, suggestions, concepts, methods, systems, designs, plans, techniques, or other materials submitted or sent to Us will be deemed not to be confidential or secret, and may be used by Us in any manner consistent with the MJI Privacy Policy, www.marcjacobs.com/privacy-policy.
MJI respects the intellectual property rights of others. MJI will remove User Content or other applicable content that violates copyright law and terminate the accounts of repeat infringers. Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512, MJI has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed copyright infringement and for processing such claims in accordance with such law. If You believe your work or content has been copied and posted to the Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Our designated copyright agent the following written information in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"): (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (b) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon; (c) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site; (d) a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available); and (f) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold MJI, its parent company, their respective affiliated and related companies, and each of their respective directors, officers, members, managers, employees and agents harmless from any and all damages, claims, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which any of them may incur arising in any way from Your misuse of the Site(s), Your placement or transmission of any message, content, information, software, or other User Content or Feedback through the Site(s), or Your breach or violation of the law or of these Terms. MJI reserves the right, at its own expense, but is not obligated, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You, and in such case, You agree to fully cooperate with MJI’s defense of such claim. This provision does not require You to indemnify MJI for any unconscionable commercial practice by MJI or for MJI’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Sites or any services provided hereunder.
MJI is not responsible for third party websites that link to or from any of the Site(s). The inclusion of any link to such third party websites on any of the Site(s) does not imply Our endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of that site or of any product or service offered by that site. We do not promise that the contents of any such third party sites are accurate, compliant with local, state or federal law, including any intellectual property laws. MJI disclaims all responsibility for any viruses or malicious code that may appear on any third party websites, and for the accuracy of any of the information provided on such linked sites and any goods or services provided or purchased from such site. Any reliance on the contents of a third party website is done at Your own risk and You assume all responsibilities and consequences resulting from such reliance. MJI shall not be held liable or responsible for the content of any sites that link to or from any of the Site(s).
The Site(s), including, without limitation, all services, content, functions, and materials, is/are provided "as is" and "as available," without warranty or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions for information, data, data processing services, uptime, or uninterrupted access, any warranties or conditions concerning the availability, accuracy, usefulness, or content of information, and any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose, and We hereby disclaim any and all such warranties and conditions, express and implied, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. We do not warrant that the Site(s) or the services, content, functions, or materials contained therein will be timely, secure, uninterrupted, or error free, or that defects will be corrected. We make no warranty that the Site(s) will meet User's requirements. No advice, results or information, whether oral or written, obtained by You from Us or through the Site(s) shall create any warranty not expressly made herein. Using the Internet may expose You to certain risks. Neither MJI nor its parent or affiliates assumes any responsibility, and shall not be liable for, any damages to, or viruses that may infect, Your computer equipment or other property on account of Your access to, use of, or browsing in the Site(s) or Your downloading of any materials, data, text, images, video, or audio from the Site(s). If You are dissatisfied with the Site(s), Your sole remedy is to discontinue using the Site(s).
We cannot, and do not, guarantee the correctness, precision, thoroughness, or completeness of any of the information available on the Site(s), nor will We be liable for any inaccuracy or omission concerning any of the information provided on the Site(s).
The foregoing exclusions of express and implied warranties do not apply to the extent prohibited by local laws. Please refer to Your local laws for any such prohibitions.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE DISCLAIMERS DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS, DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.
In no event, including but not limited to negligence, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws, shall MJI, its parent company, their respective affiliates, any member of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton family, or any of their directors, officers, members, managers, employees, agents, or content or service providers (collectively, the “Protected Entities”) be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising from, or directly or indirectly related to, the use of, or the inability to use, the Site(s) or the content, materials, and functions related thereto, Your provision of information via the Site(s), lost business or lost sales, profits, or goodwill, even if such Protected Entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages so some of the above limitations may not apply to certain Users. In no event shall any of the Protected Entities be liable for or in connection with any content posted, transmitted, exchanged, or received by or on behalf of any User or other person on or through the Site(s).
In addition to the limitations of liability stated here, in connection with a cross-border purchase by a User, MJI’s entire liability, and your exclusive remedy for any product that is lost or damaged during international shipment, is further limited to the types and amount of damages described in the Terms and Conditions for International Shipments of MJI’s shipping partner, Global-e.
MJI’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (USD $100.00).
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS, DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.
We and our service providers control and operate the Site(s) from the United States of America. We do not represent that materials on the Site(s) are appropriate or available for use in locations outside of the United States of America. Persons who choose to access the Site(s) from other locations do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. All parties to these Terms waive their respective rights to a trial by jury.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and MJI agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate MJI’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances MJI may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this TOU, the rules set forth in this TOU will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or MJI must do the following things:
(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.
(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.
(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and MJI, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and MJI.
NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and MJI in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND MJI WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing MJI at legal@marcjacobs.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1)Your Name; (2) the URL of Terms of Use; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms of Use. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms of Use by using the website.
In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in New York, NY.
MJI may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Site(s) or the Site(s)'s services at any time. If you violate any of these Terms, Your permission to use the Site(s) automatically terminates.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Site(s) and supersede any and all other agreements, oral or in writing, with respect to the Site(s). These Terms are personal to You, and You may not assign Your rights or obligations to anyone.
The sections on indemnification, limitation of liability, and disclaimer of warranties do not apply to New Jersey residents.
All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

Sponsor reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Contest if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Contest is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor’s control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play and/or feasibility of the Contest as contemplated herein, or for any other reason in Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion. In the event an insufficient number of eligible entries are received and/or Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Contest as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made epidemic of health of other means, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or equipment failure, riot or civil disturbance, terrorist threat or activity, war (declared or undeclared) or any federal state or local government law, order, or regulation, public health crisis, order of any court or jurisdiction, or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control (each a “Force Majeure” event or occurrence), then subject to any governmental approval which may be required, Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, extend or terminate the Contest. If the Contest is terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor will (if possible) select the winner in a random drawing from all eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination.

NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP/WAIVER OF EQUITABLE RELIEF: Each entrant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between the entrant and the Promotion Entities is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the entrant’s decision to provide the entrant’s Submission to Sponsor for purposes of the Contest does not place the Promotion Entities in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to elements of the entrant’s Submission. Each entrant understands and acknowledges that the Promotion Entities have wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other materials, and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed by their own employees.

Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that such entrant will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of any Promotion Entity’s use of any such similar or identical material. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that the Promotion Entities do not now and shall not have in the future any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with respect to the infringement or protection of the copyright in and to the Submission. Finally, each entrant acknowledges that, with respect to any claim by entrant relating to or arising out of a Promotion Entity’s actual or alleged exploitation or use of any Submission or other material submitted in connection with the Contest, the damage, if any, thereby caused to the applicable entrant will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle such entrant to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, and entrant’s rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law.
NO OBLIGATION TO USE: Sponsor shall have no obligation (express or implied) to use any Submission or any materials or content created by the entrant (the “Materials”), or to otherwise exploit any Submission or Materials or, if commenced, to continue the distribution or exploitation thereof, and Sponsor may at any time abandon the use of the Submission or Materials for any reason, with or without legal justification or excuse, and contestants shall not be entitled to any damages or other relief by reason thereof.
DATES & DEADLINES/ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF CONTESTANTS: Because of the unique nature and scope of the Contest, Sponsor reserves the right, in addition to those other rights reserved herein, to modify any date(s) or deadline(s) set forth in these Official Rules or otherwise governing the Contest. Sponsor cannot accurately predict the number of entrants who will participate in the Contest.
FURTHER DOCUMENTATION: If Sponsor shall desire to secure additional assignments, certificates of engagement for the Submission, the Materials or other documents as Sponsor may reasonably require in order to effectuate the purposes and intents of these Official Rules, then each entrant agrees to sign the same upon Sponsor’s request therefor.
GOVERNING LAW/JURISDICTION: ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENTRANTS OR SPONSOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTEST SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OF CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER STATE’S LAWS.
ARBITRATION PROVISION: By participating in this Contest, each entrant agrees that any and all disputes the entrant may have with, or claims entrant may have against, the Promotion Entities relating to, arising out of or connected in any way with (i) the Contest, (ii) the awarding or redemption of any prize, and/or (iii) the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved individually and exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the National Arbitration Forum (the “Forum”) and conducted before a sole arbitrator pursuant to the Code of Procedure established by the Forum. The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by the Forum pursuant to the Code of Procedure, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed by the participant and Sponsor. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Official Rules and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable participant may have entered into in connection with the Contest. There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the participant’s and/or Sponsor’s individual claims and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against the participant or Sponsor. For more information on the Forum and/or the Forum’s Code of Procedure, please visit their website at www.arb-forum.com. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.

NO OBLIGATION TO USE: Sponsor shall have no obligation (express or implied) to use any Submission or any materials or content created by the entrant (the “Materials”), or to otherwise exploit any Submission or Materials or, if commenced, to continue the distribution or exploitation thereof, and Sponsor may at any time abandon the use of the Submission or Materials for any reason, with or without legal justification or excuse, and contestants shall not be entitled to any damages or other relief by reason thereof.
DATES & DEADLINES/ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF CONTESTANTS: Because of the unique nature and scope of the Contest, Sponsor reserves the right, in addition to those other rights reserved herein, to modify any date(s) or deadline(s) set forth in these Official Rules or otherwise governing the Contest. Sponsor cannot accurately predict the number of entrants who will participate in the Contest.
FURTHER DOCUMENTATION: If Sponsor shall desire to secure additional assignments, certificates of engagement for the Submission, the Materials or other documents as Sponsor may reasonably require in order to effectuate the purposes and intents of these Official Rules, then each entrant agrees to sign the same upon Sponsor’s request therefor.
GOVERNING LAW/JURISDICTION: ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENTRANTS OR SPONSOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SWEEPSTAKES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER STATE’S LAWS.
