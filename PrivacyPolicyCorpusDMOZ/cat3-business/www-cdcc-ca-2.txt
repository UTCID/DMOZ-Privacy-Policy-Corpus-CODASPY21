Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
This policy applies to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Bourse de Montréal Inc. (the "Montréal Exchange") and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation ("CDCC" or the "clearinghouse"). The Montréal Exchange and CDCC will be collectively referred to herein as "the Montréal Exchange" or "we", unless the context requires otherwise.
The Montréal Exchange maintains strict security, confidentiality and protection of personal information standards and we make it our priority to ensure the security, confidentiality and accuracy of the personal information provided to us by our employees, directors, shareholders, clients, suppliers, market participants and clearing members ("you"), whether it is through our websites (www.m-x.ca or www.cdcc.ca) or otherwise.
In this policy, the phrase "service providers" includes, but is not limited to, any licensors, suppliers, information providers or other third parties that provide or administer, from time to time, any data, information, content, application, tool or service to the Montréal Exchange.
Consent
By supplying your personal information to the Montréal Exchange or to its service providers and agents, you explicitly authorize the Montréal Exchange to collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this policy for the purposes expressed herein and with applicable laws.
Subject to legal, regulatory and/or contractual requirements, you may withhold or withdraw your consent in respect of some of the purposes outlined hereafter by contacting our Privacy Officer, whose contact information is provided at the end of this document. However, the withholding or withdrawal of your consent may make it impossible for us to provide you or to continue providing you with certain services or information that may be useful for you.
If you provide or intend to provide personal information to the Montréal Exchange or to its service providers and agents concerning another individual, you must declare that you have the necessary power to do so and/or that you have obtained the necessary consent from this individual to allow us to collect, use or disclose this personal information for the purposes laid out in this policy.
Please note that the Montréal Exchange reserves the right to amend or revise this policy at any time. In such event, the Montréal Exchange will post the amendments on its websites (www.m-x.ca or www.cdcc.ca), so that you are informed at all times about the information collected, used or disclosed by the Montréal Exchange. In so doing, you will be able to decide at any time whether or not you want the Montréal Exchange to use your personal information in the manner so described. The Montréal Exchange will use your personal information in accordance with the version of this policy that is in effect when such personal information is collected or in any other manner that you approve.
What is personal information
Personal information is any information that refers to or allows an individual to be identified. This includes information that can be linked to you, such as your name, personal address, telephone and/or fax numbers and personal email address, date of birth, social insurance number or credit card number.
Personal information does not include information considered of a professional nature that is generally found on a business card, such as your name, position or function, professional address, professional telephone and/or fax numbers. However, please note that your professional email address is considered as personal information.
Use of personal information
The personal information that you communicate to us and that we collect and use enables us to carry on our business as a derivatives exchange and clearinghouse and to fully perform our role as a self-regulatory organization.

for CDCC to identify, monitor and manage the risks arising from tiered participation arrangements;
for CDCC to facilitate the default management process in the event of the default of any one of its clearing members;
to analyze, investigate or inspect the conduct and/or business of an approved participant, any approved person or any holder of a restricted trading permit;
to handle disciplinary complaints concerning an approved participant and/or any approved person or holder of a restricted trading permit;
to develop, forge and maintain business relations with current or potential clients, suppliers, market participants and clearing members;
to identify you;

for any other purpose which you approve.
Disclosure of personal information

1. Service providers and agents. Your personal information may be communicated to service providers and agents chosen by the Montréal Exchange to discharge certain duties on its behalf, such as providing administrative, data processing, document management and website hosting services.
2. Credit card companies. You may have to transmit information concerning a credit card either by fax or from certain places on our websites in order to purchase a product or service offered by the Montréal Exchange. In such case, only the information required to complete the purchase will be provided to the relevant credit card issuer or service provider.
3. Regulators. The Montréal Exchange may communicate your personal information to self-regulatory organizations and to competent regulators as required or permitted by law.
You acknowledge that there are security and privacy limitations on the Internet, which are beyond the control of the Montréal Exchange, and that the security, integrity and confidentiality of any information or data exchanged between you and the Montréal Exchange through its websites or by email cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, the Montréal Exchange accepts no liability for the use of such information or data by you or third parties.

The Montréal Exchange will ensure, to the extent possible, that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, in accordance with the intended purpose for which this information is collected.

The Montréal Exchange may keep your personal information in secure filing cabinets and offices as well as in databases or email boxes or on servers hosted by the Montréal Exchange or by service providers, in Canada or other jurisdictions, for periods of time and using the administrative and technological security measures it deems reasonable, according to the nature and level of sensitivity of the personal information (limited access to the Montréal Exchange's offices, locked filing cabinets, use of data networks secured and protected by firewalls, use of passwords, etc.). The Montréal Exchange regularly verifies its existing security measures to ensure that they are properly managed, effective and adequate. The Montréal Exchange also ensures, through contractual agreements, that the personal information it communicates to third parties is protected.
Your personal information may be transferred (or otherwise made available) to our affiliates and other third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we use service providers to assist us process, store and secure data. This may include sending email or other communications using their online services.
