In short, we neither sell nor share privileged client information. We are tight-lipped in private matters yet determined to help you be seen, heard and remembered for the good you do.
We respect the privacy of each and every visitor. We will only collect personally identifiable data, such as your name, title, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, when you voluntarily submit it to us. When applicable, we, and/or the firms we hire who all must sign a confidentiality agreement, will use this information to comply with your request for information.
Again, we will not sell, share or otherwise transfer your personal information to any third party seeking to make sales without your express written consent. We could say more, but you get the idea.
