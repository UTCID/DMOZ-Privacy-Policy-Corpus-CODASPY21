Our Privacy Policy
If you contact us by phone or email, we use the contact information you provide us only to respond to your question.
We do not add your email address to a mailing list, or provide the information to anyone else, without your permission.
If you enter your zip or postal code and your country in our shopping cart, we use it only to calculate shipping charges.
We save your location information for a few days so you don't have to re-enter it if you use the shopping cart again during that time.
If you place an order with us, we use the information you provide us solely to complete your order.
This includes:
providing our credit card processor with your billing information (if you pay by credit card) so they can verify your card is legitimate and belongs to you, and
providing the shipper you have chosen with your shipping and contact information so they can delivery your shipment to you and contact you if they are unable to do so.
We request your email address and phone number so we can contact you if there is a problem or question about your order.
We do not add your name to a mailing list or provide your information to anyone else, without your permission.
