The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#st…Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)We do not specifically market to children under 13.When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.Fair Information PracticesThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States. The concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and their implementation is critical for compliance with the various privacy laws protecting personal information.In order to be compliant with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:We will notify the users via email      • Within 7 business days from our first knowledge of the eventWe also agree to the individual redress principle. This requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors failing to adhere to the law. This principle mandates that individuals have enforceable rights against data mis-users as well as recourse through court action or potentially, government agency enforcement.CAN-SPAM ActWe collect your email address in order to: respond to communication you submit, confirm an order or send a newsletter.The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.To be in compliance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at sales@ua-sp.com email subject heading “unsubscribe”We will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.Contacting UsIf there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the information below.Herman Grant Company1100 Ashmore AvenueChattanooga, TN 374151-800-266-7227
