AirBorn, Inc. encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from AirBorn, Inc. so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.  AirBorn, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the AirBorn, Inc. and the AirBorn, Inc. family of websites.
Use of Your Personal Information

Use of Cookies
The AirBorn, Inc. website use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize AirBorn, Inc. pages or register with AirBorn, Inc. site or services, a cookie helps AirBorn, Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same AirBorn, Inc. website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved so you can easily use the AirBorn, Inc. features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the AirBorn, Inc. services or websites you visit.
Security of Your Personal Information
AirBorn, Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. AirBorn, Inc. secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
