Privacy
Policy
American
Builders Network provides you, the prospective home
buyer, with an easy and effective way to contact
well-qualified builders. We respect
your privacy and want you to know that:
The
information you provide when making a request of a
participating builder(s) is sent only to that
builder(s). The form will ask for your name, address,
phone and email address. This allows the builder to
respond to your request.
No
information is shared, sold, rented or otherwise
provided to any party other than the specific
builder(s) from whom you have made an inquiry.
The
information is saved in an American Builders Network
database for the purpose of providing member builders
periodic reports of their Web site activity.
For
quality control purposes, American Builders Network
or the builder may send follow-up e-mail to verify
that you received the information requested.
