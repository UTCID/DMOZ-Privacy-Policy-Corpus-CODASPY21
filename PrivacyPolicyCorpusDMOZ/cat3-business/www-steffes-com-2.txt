Terms of Service
HomeTerms of Service
STEFFES, LLC – TERMS OF SERVICE
Steffes, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Steffes”) provides (1) the Steffes website located at www.steffes.com, and all associated sites linked to www.steffes.com, including the Steffes Connect user account website that may be accessed at www.steffesconnect.com (each a “Site”), (2) services accessible through the Sites (“Web Apps”), (3) software that may be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet to access services (“Mobile Apps”), and (4) services, including services that can be accessed using the Web Apps and Mobile Apps via user account (“Services”), all for use in conjunction with Steffes hardware products (“Products”). The term “Services” includes services provided via the Sites, Web Apps, or Mobile Apps.
These Terms of Service (“Terms” or “Agreement”) govern your access to, and use of, the Services and Products. Please read these Terms carefully. The term “you”, as used in these Terms, means any person or entity who accesses or uses the Services or Products and any person or entity who creates an Account (as defined in Section 2(a) and accepts these Terms, including Authorized Users (as defined in Section 2(b). These Terms define your legal rights, but you may have other legal rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, limitations of liability, indemnification, waiver of class action and waiver of punitive damages under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you.
THESE TERMS ARE A LEGAL AGREEMENT. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS THROUGH A SITE, WEB APP OR MOBILE APP, OR BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE SITES) OR PRODUCTS, YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCESS AND USE. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY AND CAPACITY (SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW) TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE, SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW, OF SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE SITE, APPS, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, OR DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION 1(b)(ii) TO USE THE APP, SITES, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, YOU SHOULD DISCONNECT YOUR PRODUCTS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND CEASE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS.
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE UPDATES OF THE APPS, SERVICES AND OF THE PRODUCTS CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE APPS OR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS.
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SECTIONS 4 AND 5 DESCRIBE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH LIFE SAFETY AND CRITICAL USES. PLEASE READ THESE DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY, AS YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THEM AND ACCEPTING THEM.
1. Overview, Eligibility, Customer Service, Term and Termination
(a) Overview and Relation to Other Agreements. These Terms govern your use of the Services and Products. Your purchase of any Product is governed by the limited warranty provided with that Product (“Limited Warranty”). The software embedded in the Product (and any updates thereto) (“Product Software”) is licensed and governed by the End User License Agreement. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms or rules, which will be posted on the Services in connection with such features. All additional guidelines, terms or rules and the Privacy Policy are incorporated by reference into these Terms and you are agreeing to accept and abide by them by using the Services and Products.
(b) Eligibility. (i) You may use the Services and Products only if you have the legal capacity to form a binding contract with Steffes (except subject to the provisions of clause (1)(b)(ii) below), you accept these Terms through a Site, Web App or Mobile App, or by accessing or using the Services or Products, and only if you are in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state/provincial, national and international laws, rules and regulations. (ii) If you are an Authorized User, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13 (or equivalent minimum age in the jurisdiction where you reside), and in the event you are between the age of 13 (or equivalent minimum age in the jurisdiction where you reside) and the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside, that you will only use the Services and Products under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. Any use or access to the Services and Products by individuals under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the jurisdiction where you reside) is strictly prohibited and is a violation of these Terms. The Services and Products are not available to any users previously prohibited from using the Services and Products by Steffes.
(c) Customer Service. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Products, the Services or these Terms, please contact Steffes at security@steffes.com. You understand and agree that customer service and any customer care and support offered and provided by Steffes is not a 911 service or dispatch center, an emergency service provider or dispatch service, or a lifesaving solution for people at risk in their home or otherwise. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE OR ANY CUSTOMER CARE AND SUPPORT OFFERED BY STEFFES WITH ANY LIFE/SAFETY EMERGENCY, MEDICAL EMERGENCY, OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY. IF YOU HAVE ANY SUCH EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE POLICE, FIRE DEPARTMENT, 911 OR APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SERVICE.
(d) Term and Termination. These Terms will remain in full force and effect as long as you continue to access or use the Services or Products, or until terminated in accordance with the provisions of these Terms. At any time, Steffes may (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services, or (ii) terminate these Terms with respect to you if Steffes, in good faith, believes that you have used the Services or Products in violation of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms or rules. If you transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services with respect to that Product automatically terminates and the new owner will have no right to use the Product or Services under your Account (as described below) and will need to register for a separate Account with Steffes and accept these Terms.
(e) Effect of Termination. Upon termination of these Terms, your Account and your right to use the Services will automatically terminate.
2. Accounts
(a) Your Account. To use certain Services and Products, you must register for a user account (“Account”) and provide certain information about yourself, as prompted by the applicable registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information that you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (c) your use of the Services and Products will not violate any US or other applicable law or regulation (e.g., you are not located in an embargoed country or are not listed as a prohibited or restricted party under applicable export control laws and regulations). You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account and to maintain your password securely to prevent others from gaining access. You agree to immediately notify Steffes of any unauthorized use or suspected unauthorized use of your Account, or any other breach of security. Steffes is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
(b) As the individual who creates an Account, You and individuals you allow access to your account are considered “Authorized Users” as long as they satisfy the Eligibility requirements in Section 1(b). Authorized Users may have the ability to use the Services and monitor and control the Products (for example, an Authorized User can change your heating and cooling schedule or turn your camera on or off). Authorized Users may also have the ability to view information (including personal information) and content across all of an Owner’s Products, Services and Works with Steffes Connect (for example, an Authorized User will receive mobile alerts). Authorized Users are responsible for their actions and agree to be fully responsible for all actions relating to Your Products, Services and Account.
3. Access to Services
(a) Access and Use. Subject to these Terms, Steffes grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive right (without the right to sub-license) to access and use the Services by (i) using the Web Apps in connection with, and solely for the purpose of, controlling and monitoring the Products you own or are authorized to control and monitor or otherwise accessing a service explicitly provided by Steffes for your use (the “Permitted Purpose”), (ii) installing and using the Mobile Apps solely on your own handheld mobile device (e.g., iPhone, iPad or Android smartphone) and solely for the Permitted Purpose, and (iii) accessing the Sites solely for the Permitted Purpose.
(b) Automatic Software Updates. Steffes may, from time to time, develop patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades and other modifications to improve the performance of the Services and/or the Product Software (“Updates”). These may be automatically installed without providing any additional notice or receiving any additional consent. You consent to this automatic update. If you do not want such Updates, your remedy is to terminate your Account and stop using the Services and the Products. If you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates automatically. You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates to use the Services and the Products and you agree to install any Updates that Steffes provides promptly. Your continued use of the Services and the Products is your agreement – (i) to these Terms with respect to the Services and Products, and (ii) to the End User License Agreement with respect to updated Product Software; and (iii) any change or updates that Steffes may make to these Terms or the End User License Agreement over time.
(c) Steffes-provided interface to Third-Party Products and Services. Over time, Steffes may provide the opportunity for you to interface the Products and Services to one or more third-party products and services, through and using the Services (“Third-Party Products and Services”). You decide whether you want to interface, and with which Third-Party Products and Services you want to interface. Your explicit consent and authorization are required for this interface and is revocable by you at any time. Once your consent is given for a particular Third-Party Product and Service, you agree that Steffes may exchange information and control data regarding you and your products, including your personal information, in order to enable the interface that you have authorized. Once this information is shared with the particular Third-Party Product and Service, its use will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy and not by Steffes’ privacy documentation. You acknowledge and agree that Steffes makes no representation or warranty about the quality or safety of any Third-Party Products or Services or the interface with Product and Services. Accordingly, Steffes is not responsible for your use of any Third-Party Product or Service, or any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any Third-Party Products or Services. You should contact the third party with any questions about their Third-Party Products and Services.
(d) Certain materials may be displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photographs, video, images and illustrations (“Content”)). The Content also includes information that you and other users provide us with in the course of using the Services (collectively, “User Submissions”), which we may use to provide, maintain and improve the Services. You may also post feedback, comments, questions or other information on the Sites. You are solely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise disseminate using, or in connection with, the Services, or that you contribute in any manner to the Services; you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it; and you license to Steffes all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the Service pursuant to these Terms. You shall abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services, and shall not use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purposes whatsoever any Content or third-party submissions or other proprietary rights not owned by you: (i) without the express prior written consent of the respective owners, and (ii) in any way that violates any third-party right. Steffes reserves the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have breached the immediately preceding sentence), or for no reason at all.
(e) Certain Restrictions. The rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following restrictions: (i) you agree not to license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Products; (ii) you agree not to modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse-compile or reverse-engineer any part of the Services or Products; (iii) you agree not to access the Services or Products in order to build a similar or competitive service or product; (iv) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Services or Products may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; (v) you agree not to upload, transmit or distribute any computer viruses, worms or any software intended to damage or alter a computer or communications network, computer, handheld mobile device, data, the Services, the Products, the Product Software or any other system, device or property; (vi) you agree not to interfere with, disrupt or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the servers or networks connected to the Services or violate the regulations, policies or procedures of such networks; (vii) you agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by means other than through the interface that is provided by Steffes; and (viii) you agree not to remove, obscure or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyrights and trademark notices) that may be contained in, or displayed in connection with, the Services or Products. Any future release, update or other addition to functionality of the Services shall be subject to these Terms.
(f) Open Source. Certain items of independent, third-party code may be included in the Web Apps and/or Mobile Apps that are subject to the GNU General Public License (“GPL”) or other open-source licenses (“Open-Source Software”). The Open-Source Software is licensed under the terms of the license that accompanies such Open-Source Software. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end-user license for such Open-Source Software. In particular, nothing in these Terms restricts your right to copy, modify and distribute such Open-Source Software that is subject to the terms of the GPL.
(g) Privacy. Please review Section 4(k) below and the Privacy Policy for Steffes Web Sites. These documents describe practices regarding the information that you or Steffes may collect from users of the Products and Services, including any Content or User Submissions.
(h) Security. Steffes cares about the integrity and security of your personal information and has measures in place to protect your information. Steffes cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.
(i) Modification. Steffes reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Services or any part thereof with or without notice. You agree that Steffes will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services or any part thereof.
(j) Access Outside Certain Countries. Although the Sites are accessible worldwide, the Products and Services provided or accessed through or on the Sites are not available to all persons or in all countries. If you choose to access the Sites from outside a country in which Steffes supports the Product and Services listed here (“Target Country”), you do so on your own initiative, and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws in your country. You understand and accept that the Sites are not designed for use in a non-Target Country and that some, or all, of the features of the Sites may not work or be appropriate for use in such a country. To the extent permissible by law, Steffes accepts no responsibility or liability for any damage or loss caused by your access or use of the Sites or Steffes Products in a non-Target Country. You will be bound by these Terms wherever you access or use the Sites or the Services.
4. Agreed Usage and Limitations of Steffes Services and Products
(a) Intended Use of Steffes Services. The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of Steffes Products. While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond Steffes’ control, including Wi-Fi intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and operators, among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that Steffes is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the Services.
(b) No Life Safety or Critical Uses of the Products and Services. You acknowledge and agree that the Products and Services, whether standing alone or when interfaced with Third-Party Products or Services, are not certified for emergency response. Steffes makes no warranty or representation that use of the Products or Services with any Third-Party Product or Service will affect or increase any level of safety. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHETHER STANDING ALONE OR INTERFACED WITH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. FURTHER, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL STEFFES DISPATCH EMERGENCY SERVICES TO YOUR HOME IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.
(c) Reliability of Services. You acknowledge that the Services, including remote access and mobile notifications, are not error-free or 100% reliable and 100% available. Proper functioning of the Services relies and is dependent on, among other things, the transmission of data through your wi-fi network, enabled wireless device (such as a phone or tablet) and broadband internet access, or optional Cellular Backup service, for which neither Steffes nor any wireless or data carrier is responsible, and may be interrupted, delayed, refused, or otherwise limited for a variety of reasons, including insufficient coverage, power outages, termination of service and access, environmental conditions, interference, non-payment of applicable fees and charges, unavailability of radio frequency channels, system capacity, upgrades, repairs or relocations, and priority access by emergency responders in the event of a disaster or emergency (collectively, “Service Interruptions”). You understand that Service Interruptions may result in the Services being unreliable and/or unavailable for the duration of the Service Interruption. We cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive notifications within any given time, or at all. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR CRITICAL PURPOSES. MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS REGARDING THE STATUS AND ALARMS ON YOUR STEFFES PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. There is no way for Steffes to provide specific information relating to a situation in your home or elsewhere. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself on how to respond to an emergency and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.
(d) Service Interruptions; no refund or rebate. The Services may be suspended temporarily, without notice, for security reasons, systems failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances. You agree that you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for such suspensions. Steffes does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.
(e) System Requirements. The Services will not be accessible without: (i) a working Wi-Fi network in your home to communicate with the Products; (ii) an Account; (iii) continual broadband Internet access in your home with bandwidth to support the Products you use; and (iv) other system elements that may be specified by Steffes, including but not limited a mobile device or computer with access to an application. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and you acknowledge Services may not work as described when the requirements and compatibility have not been met. If you modify, substitute, move, or otherwise change any of the required system elements, it is your sole duty and responsibility to be sure they are compatible and properly configured to work with the Products and Services.
(f) Energy Savings and Other Benefits. Unless explicitly promising a “guarantee”, Steffes does not guarantee or promise any specific level of energy savings or other monetary benefit from the use of the Products or Services or any feature thereof. Actual energy savings and monetary benefits vary depending on factors beyond Steffes’ control or knowledge. From time to time, Steffes may use the Services to provide you with information that is unique to you and your energy usage and suggest an opportunity to save money on energy bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Product or Services. We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and information about you and your household. You acknowledge that these promotions are not a guarantee of actual savings and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from Steffes if your savings differ.
(g) The Services provide you and third parties with information (“Product Information”) regarding the Products in your home and their connection with other products and services. All Product Information is provided “as is” and “as available”. We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical, accessing Product Information through the Services is not a substitute for direct access of the information in the home.
(h) All information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom (or from whose account) such Content originated and Steffes will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content. You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
(i) You warrant, represent and agree that you will not contribute any Content or otherwise use the Services or Products in a manner that (i) infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any third party; (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation or is otherwise illegal; (iii) is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous or otherwise objectionable; (iv) impersonates any person or entity, including, without limitation, any employee or representative of Steffes; (v) contains a virus, Trojan Horse, worm, time bomb or other harmful computer code, file or program; (vi) jeopardizes the security of your Steffes Account or anyone else’s Account (such as allowing someone else to log into the Services as you); (vii) attempts, in any manner, to obtain or access the password, account, products, devices, systems, or other security information from any other user or third party; (viii) violates the security of any computer network or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes; (ix) runs Mail list, Listserv or any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services or any processes that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure); (x) copies or stores any significant portion of the Content; (xi) decompiles, reverse-engineers or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services; or (xii) denigrates or disrupts any network capacity or functionality.
(j) Privacy and Data Protection Laws. Steffes Products and Services are primarily intended for purely personal and household use. Nonetheless, data protection and privacy laws where you live may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of the Products and Services. You agree that you (and not Steffes) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use the Products and Services.
(k) Installation, test and use. It is your responsibility to install and use the Products and Services pursuant to the applicable manual and instructions. IF A PRODUCT IS NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED, OR IF A PRODUCT OR ANY OF ITS SENSORS ARE OUTSIDE THE DETECTION RANGE OR HINDERED OR OBSTRUCTED BY WALLS, FURNITURE, PERSONAL PROPERTY OR OTHER THINGS, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE DETECTION FAILURES. It is your responsibility to test the Products once installed to be sure the Products (and any related sensors, components and peripherals) are functioning and communicating as intended and designed, and then regularly test and maintain the Products after installation.
(l) Check batteries regularly. It is your responsibility to replace any batteries for the Products, when necessary. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE PRODUCTS MAY NOT FUNCTION OR PROPERLY FUNCTION IF BATTERIES NEED REPLACEMENT; PLEASE CHECK THEM REGULARLY.
5. Limitations of Steffes Services Due to Third Parties
(a) General. Steffes Services rely on or inter-operate with third-party products and services. These third-party products and services are beyond Steffes’ control, but their operation may impact on, or be impacted by, the use and reliability of the Steffes Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) the use and availability of the Services is dependent on third-party product vendors and service providers, (ii) these third-party products and services may not operate in a reliable manner 100% of the time and they may impact on the way that the Steffes Services operate, and (iii) Steffes is not responsible for damages and losses due to the operation of these third-party products and services.
(b) Third-Party Service Providers Used By Steffes. You acknowledge that Steffes uses third-party service providers to enable and access some aspects of the Services – such as, for example, data, and mobile device notifications through mobile operating system vendors and mobile operators. YOU AGREE NOT TO RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR TIME-CRITICAL PURPOSES. FURTHER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ALL LIABILITY, DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND OR SORT, PERSONAL INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.
(c) Equipment, ISP and Operator. You acknowledge that the availability of the Services is dependent on (i) your computer, mobile device, home wiring, home Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth connection and other related equipment (“Equipment”), (ii) your Internet service provider (“ISP”) and for some Services (iii) your mobile device operator (“Operator”). You acknowledge that you are responsible for all fees charged by your ISP and Operator in connection with your use of the Services. You also acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service and other policies of your ISP and Operator.
(d) App Stores. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Mobile Apps is dependent on the third-party websites from which you download the Mobile Apps, e.g., the Google Play Store from Google or the App Store from Apple (each an “App Store”). You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Steffes and not with an App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading Mobile Apps from it. You agree to comply with such App Store terms and conditions, and your license to use the Mobile Apps is conditioned upon your compliance with such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent that such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than or otherwise conflict with the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.
(e) Third-Party Website Links and Referrals. The Sites may contain links to other websites operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”) and referrals to third-party vendors (“Referred Vendors”). Such Third-Party Sites and Referred Vendors are not under our control. Steffes provides these links and referrals only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant or make any representations with respect to such Third-Party Sites or Referred Vendors. Your use of these Third-Party Sites is at your own risk.
(f) Authorized Users. Steffes is not responsible for any Authorized User’s behavior, or for any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to their use of the Services.
(g) Release Regarding Third Parties. Steffes is not responsible for third parties or their products and services, including, without limitation, the App Stores, Third-Party Products and Services, Third-Party Sites, Referred Vendors, Equipment, ISP and Operators. Steffes hereby disclaims, and you hereby discharge, waive and release Steffes and its licensors and suppliers from any past, present and future claims, liabilities and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to your interactions with such third parties and their products and services. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOUR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
6. Ownership and Intellectual Property
a) Steffes Property. You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets, in the Product, Product Software and Services (i.e., the Sites, Web Apps and Mobile Apps) are owned by Steffes or its affiliates or our licensors. Your possession, access to and use of the Product, Product Software and Services do not transfer to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such intellectual property rights. Steffes, and its affiliates and licensors and suppliers, reserve all rights not granted in these Terms. The Services are licensed to you, not sold, under these Terms.
You may only copy parts of the Services (including this Site) onto your own computer for your own personal use. You may not use the content of the Services in any other public or commercial way, nor may you copy or incorporate any of the content of the Services into any other work, including your own website, without the written consent of Steffes. You must have a license from us before you can post or redistribute any portion of the Services. Steffes retains full and complete title to all content on the Services, including any downloadable software and all data that accompanies it. You must not copy, modify or in any way reproduce or damage the structure or presentation of the Services, or any content therein.
