To the team at QHM, I would like to say thank you for your great service and Product. With a small order that I had I have never had the level of service, quickness of order and quality of product before. The girls were extremely happy with the socks and will wear them with pride at the State Championships this weekend. Once again thanks and I am collecting together another order soon.
