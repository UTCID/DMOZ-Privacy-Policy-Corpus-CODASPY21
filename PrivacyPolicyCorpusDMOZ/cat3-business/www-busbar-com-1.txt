Introduction
Mersen Electrical Power (hereinafter “Mersen”) is committed to safeguarding the privacy and personal information of all users of its website (hereinafter the “User” or “Users”). It actively invites Users to take note of this Privacy Policy which ensures that this information is protected. Mersen is also committed to complying with the core principles of the French data protection act of January 6, 1978, as amended, and European Regulation No. 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, given that the Group’s headquarters are located in the European Union and it processes data that concerns residents in the European Union. This Privacy Policy seeks to protect personal information and applies to all Mersen Group entities and subsidiaries with regard to the collection, processing, use, disclosure, transfer and storage of data. It requires all entities in all countries to comply with a shared set of provisions that guarantee a very high level of protection for personal information.
1. Scope of application
This Privacy Policy explains the way in which Mersen and Mersen Group entities process the personal information of Users who visit the Mersen website (hereinafter the “Website”).
2. Collecting personal information
The Website collects personal information in three ways:
directly, when Users choose to share personal information with Mersen;
indirectly and automatically, using Google Analytics;
indirectly, using cookies.
A. Information Users choose to share with Mersen
The personal information that Users choose to share with Mersen includes all information collected directly by the Website, as well as any other type of information that Mersen expressly requests Users share with the Company, such as:
last name, first name, address, email address and telephone number;
education and professional status;
comments;
interests and preferences for marketing purposes.
Personal information is processed for the purposes described in paragraph 3 and is declared to the French National Commission for Data Protection and Privacy (CNIL), via declaration No. […]. Insofar as personal information may sometimes be collected by way of a questionnaire, Users acknowledge that Mersen, in accordance with Article 32 of the French data protection act, as amended, has provided them with the following information:
“1° the identity of the data controller and of their representative, if any;
2° the purposes of the processing for which the data are intended;
3° whether replies to the questions are compulsory or optional; […]
6° the rights granted them by Section 2 of this Chapter, including the individual’s right to decide what should happen to their personal information after their death.”
B. Information collected automatically by Google Analytics
The Website uses Google Analytics, supplied by Google Inc. (“Google”), to analyze its website traffic. The tool collects anonymous data in order to monitor trends in website traffic without individually identifying each visitor, and uses its own set of cookies to track visitor activity. It also generates statistical reports that are used to improve the quality of the Website. Automatically collected information includes:
The User’s IP address;
Information about the User’s computer, such as their type of connection, current browser, and operating system, as well as their cell phone or tablet operating system, and other device identifiers;
The User’s URL connections, as well as the date and time of connections and the content viewed on the Website;
The cookies generated through the use of the Website, which are transferred directly to a Google server in the US where they are stored.
To disable cookies and block the automatic collection of data, some browsers display a message when a cookie is sent that users can then refuse on a case by case basis (see the help and support menu on your browser to configure this feature). In addition to refusing cookies, users can also install an add-on that disables Google Analytics and stops the tool from collecting information about their browsing history: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en Google Analytics terms and conditions:  http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/
C. Cookies
Cookies are small text files that often have a unique ID and are stored on User hard drives. They are sent by the website being viewed by the User to the User’s browser, and are then stored on their hard drive. The main types of cookies used are “http” cookies and trackers that are sent and read when a website is visited, whatever the type of device used, including computers, cell phones and tablets. Cookies allow Mersen to collect information about User visits to the Website for statistical purposes, and to make the Website more user-friendly and improve the browsing experience. Users are asked to explicitly consent to cookies being collected before the data is stored. User consent for cookies and cookie processing is valid for a period of 13 months. Users are also able to configure their browser to block cookies and still have access to certain Website functionalities. By blocking cookies, Users nonetheless accept that certain features and functionalities may be lost. Users can find many resources on the Internet about cookies and how to manage their preferences like www.allaboutcookies.org or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie.
