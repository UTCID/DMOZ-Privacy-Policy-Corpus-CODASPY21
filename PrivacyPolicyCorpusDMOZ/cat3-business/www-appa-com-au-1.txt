Privacy Policy
General
APPA gathers two types of information about users of this website:
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions including registering for APPA’s trade shows.Information APPA gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout APPA’s websites.
This information allows APPA to better tailor the content of this website and to track the demographics of APPA’s audience. APPA reserves the right to share information amongst its membership base.
Usage Tracking
APPA tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of APPA’s websites. However, APPA does not correlate this information with data about individual users. APPA breaks down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
APPA may on occasion track and catalogue the search terms that users enter in the Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. APPA uses tracking information to determine which areas of APPA’s websites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
APPA does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps APPA continue to build a better service for you.
Cookies
APPA may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer.
