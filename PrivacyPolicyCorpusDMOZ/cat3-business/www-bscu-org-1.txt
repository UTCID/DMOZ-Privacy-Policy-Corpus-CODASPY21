Ask a BrightStar CU representative for information about wire transfer fees.
If you are receiving a wire transfer of funds from elsewhere, the person initiating the transfer will need to provide your name and account number at BrightStar CU as well as BrightStar CU’s routing/transit number (267078299) and our name (BrightStar Credit Union).
