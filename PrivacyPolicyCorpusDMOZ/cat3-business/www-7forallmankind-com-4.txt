We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any of the foregoing.
19. Other. These Terms and Conditions supersede any other agreement between you and us to the extent necessary to resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity between them. These Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws, with jurisdiction for disputes residing in Los Angeles County, California. Except in New Jersey and in jurisdictions where prohibited by applicable laws, rules and regulations, any claim or dispute must be brought within one (1) year from the date the cause of action arises. A printed version of these Terms and Conditions shall be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. This choice of law provision may not, however, nor may anything else in these terms and conditions, be deemed a waiver by you of any rights you may have under any applicable federal, state or local laws, rules, or regulations, and for the sake of clarity wheresoever the term "applicable laws, rules or regulations" or a similar term is used in these terms and consitions, it shall be read to include the New Jersey Truth-In-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act, N.J.S.A. 56:12-14, et seq. You may not use or export or re-export the materials at the Web Site or any copy or adaptation in violation of any applicable laws or regulations including without limitation United States export laws and regulations. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. These Terms and Conditions, inclusive of the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and 7ForAllMankind relating to your use of the Web Site, superseding any other agreement between you and 7ForAllMankind with respect to the subject matter of these Terms and Conditions. Section headings in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be found to be unenforceable, the other provisions shall still remain in full force and effect. A printed version of these Terms and Conditions shall be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
20. Disputes and Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Website and our products and services, including products or services sold or distributed through our websites and catalogues, any dealings with us and our customer service agents, any representations made by us, and/or your use of our websites (including without limitation claims relating to the breach of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis. This includes any dispute or claim you assert against our sister-brands, subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns. This also includes any dispute or claim that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration.
Unless you proceed with a small claims action, the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law will apply. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, except if prohibited by applicable laws, rules or regulations, WE BOTH HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless we both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, consolidated or class proceeding. If the requirements of this paragraph are found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void except for the waiver of any right to a jury trial described in the previous paragraph. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules, except as provided in this section. If your total claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator's fees, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If a dispute arises we strongly encourage you to first contact our Customer Service Department before starting arbitration or filing a claim in small claims court. We value our relationships with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and quickly.
The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules and forms are available at www.adr.org or by calling 877-495-4185.
21. SMS. If you elect to receive marketing text messages from us, either via our website or by sending a text message indicating your consent, you are providing your prior express written consent to receive recurring marketing or promotional SMS text messages from us (each, a “Text Message”) sent through an automatic telephone dialing system. These may include cart reminder messages. Message frequency varies. This service is optional and is not a condition for purchase. You can opt out of receiving any further Text Messages from us at any time by replying “STOP” to any Text Message you receive from us. For help, reply “HELP” to any Text Message you receive from us or contact us here.
In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your mobile provider’s message and data rates may apply to our confirmation Text Message and all subsequent Text Message correspondence according to your individual rate plan provided by your wireless carrier. Please consult your mobile service carrier’s pricing plan to determine the charges for browsing data and sending and receiving Text Messages. Under no circumstances will we or our affiliates be responsible for any SMS messaging or wireless charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless device or telephone number. If your carrier does not permit SMS messages, you may not receive the Text Messages.
Neither we nor the wireless carriers (such as T-Mobile) will be liable for any delays in the receipt of, or failure to deliver, any Text Messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. Text Message services are provided on an “AS IS” basis. Data obtained from you in connection with any Text Message services may include your cell phone number, your provider’s name and the date, time and content of your text messages. We may use this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy to contact you and to provide the services you request from us. For more information on how we use telephone numbers, please read our Privacy Policy.
If you change or deactivate the phone number you provided, you have an affirmative obligation to update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account to prevent us from inadvertently communicating with anyone who acquires any phone number(s) previously attributed to you, and any new phone number(s) you attach to your account may receive our standard marketing Text Messages unless you also unsubscribe via the above procedures.
You may elect to receive text messages from us. When you sign up to receive text messages, we will send you information about promotional offers and more. These messages may use information automatically collected based on your actions while on our sites and may prompt messaging such as cart reminders.
To the extent you voluntarily opt to have SMS notifications sent directly to your mobile phone, we receive and store the information you provide, including your telephone number or when you read a text message. You may opt out of receiving text messages at any time by texting “STOP” to our text messages.
