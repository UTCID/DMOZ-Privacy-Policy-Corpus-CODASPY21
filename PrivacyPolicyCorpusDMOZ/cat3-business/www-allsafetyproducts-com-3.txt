We review all freight charges before finalizing our invoice with you and have pleasantly surprised many of our customers when we reduce their bill without them telling us to. We make money on products, not freight!Special Shipping/Delivery Note:  Due to the large size and supplier custom assembly of our ADA and Wheelchair restrooms (PolyJohn We’ll Care and Comfort XL models and Polyportables Freedom and Liberty models) customer will be required to provide forklift or dock support to delivering trucking company for offload of unit.  If shipment is refused for this reason or driver is unable to offload unit, customer will be liable for shipping expenses both directions.
