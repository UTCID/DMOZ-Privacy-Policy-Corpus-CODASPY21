Privacy Policy

We want to make use of individual identifying information that you provide to us for purposes of serving you better. “Individual identifying information” is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title and address. Avistar uses the individual identifying information in order to personalize your experience on our website and also to be able to selectively send you communications that may be of interest to you, either electronically or otherwise. Avistar’s policy regarding use of your individual identifying information supplied to us or collected via your experience at our website, WWW.AVISTAR.COM, covers these areas:
1. Notice and Disclosure

Avistar collects the following information regarding visitors to our website: domain name, name, information regarding what pages are accessed, information volunteered by you, such as survey information, email address, or site registrations, and your preferred means of communication. In the future, Avistar may on occasion make individual identifying information available to third parties, including business partners, for marketing purposes and may use this information to contact people for marketing purposes.
2. Choice/Consent
New registrants to WWW.AVISTAR.COM have the choice to opt out of having individual identifying information provided in the registration process used for any purpose unrelated to the purpose for which the information was provided to us. Access to certain of Avistar’s web pages requires a login and password. The uses of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, are governed by a written agreement between your employer and Avistar. Your individual identifying information may be retained by Avistar to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on WWW.AVISTAR.COM.

5. Cookies
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of WWW.AVISTAR.COM use cookies to identified logged on users.
