Sue Recommends
TestimonialsSue has been especially helpful in crisis situations–she knows how to get work done! I can dictate a 10-20 page decision which she then types up into a word processing program. She sends it back to me as an e-mail attachment and it’s all ready for me to use, edit or incorporate into other documents. She’s fast, accurate, and understands the terminology.Sherwood Malamud, Arbitrator/MediatorI have been using the services of Word Processing Plus for the better part of nine years.  We use Sue primarily for transcription services.  It is clear that although the work is relatively mundane (and, in many cases repetitive) Sue thinks about what she is doing rather than just transcribing what she thinks she hears. This has not been the case with other experiences of audio-typing both here in-house and elsewhere. It is also encouraging that, when doubt arises, she asks rather than assumes. The quality of work is consistently high. I have also found the speed of the service to be more than satisfactory – one might think that working in different countries with different time zones might present problems–-that has not proved to be the case. I have, on occasions asked Sue to work outside normal hours; this has not presented a problem. Based on my experience, I have no hesitation in recommending the services of Word Processing Plus.Robert Newton, BSc. (Hons.), M.R.I.C.S., Chartered Valuation Surveyor, Bermuda Realty Company LimitedSue has been doing transcription work for us for a while now, and her work is commendable. We’re very happy to have her as a part of our team.Kathy Zengolewicz, Virtual Staff SolutionsNeed Office Equipment? Office Equipment

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Word Processing Plus and You concerning Your use of the Websites. This Agreement and any other written agreements executed between You and Word Processing Plus or any Third-Party Service Providers constitute the entire agreement concerning Your use of the Services. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Word Processing Plus or by the unilateral amendment of this Agreement by Word Processing Plus and by the posting by Word Processing Plus of such amended version. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. This Agreement and all of Your rights and obligations hereunder will not be assignable or transferable by You without the prior written consent of Word Processing Plus. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. You and Word Processing Plus are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Except for the Word Processing Plus Parties as and to the extent set forth in Sections 14, 19 and 22(e), and Word Processing Plus’s Third-Party Service Providers, licensors and suppliers as and to the extent expressly set forth in Section 17, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement or infringement of proprietary or other third party rights by You would cause irreparable injury to Word Processing Plus and Word Processing Plus’s Third-Party Service Providers, licensors and suppliers, and would therefore entitle Word Processing Plus or Word Processing Plus’s Third-Party Service Providers, licensors or suppliers, as the case may be, to injunctive relief.
