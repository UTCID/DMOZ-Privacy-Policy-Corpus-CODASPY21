Heating & Cooling Self Help
Typically, heating and cooling equipment shuts everything off when it’s not working properly, but just to be safe, you should consider turning off the gas and/or electricity to the unit until you can Find a Pro to get everything working properly again.
Water Heating Self Help
When you’re having trouble with your heating, cooling or water heating equipment, seconds count. The best course of action is to Find a Pro, but there are a few things you can do to prevent damage to your home and belongings in the meantime.
1Turn Off the Gas
1. Locate the valve on the gas line to the furnace
2. Turn it so that it’s 90° to the pipe
2Turn Off the Electricity
1. In your breaker box, look for a breaker labeled “air conditioner,” “furnace,” “heater,” “Water Heater” or something similar. NOTE: If there is a light switch attached to your Water Heater system, you can flip the switch to off to cut off the electrical supply to the unit.
2. Turn the breaker(s) to off NOTE: There may be more than one
