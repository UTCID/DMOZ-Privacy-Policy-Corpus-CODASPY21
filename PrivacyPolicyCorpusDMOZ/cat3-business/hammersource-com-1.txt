PLEASE READ THIS:
USPS is running very slow in 2020. Choose FedEx if you want on time delivery.
This site DOES NOT always show Out-of-Stock items. If you are in a hurry, LET ME KNOW by EMail at sales@hammersource.com.I am not an Amazonian giant and your order will not mystically appear by drone tomorrow. Many items are assembled when ordered- Brass, Copper, Malleable Iron, Wood and others.With 1500 items, I don't always have everything in stock. If out-of-stock, I will ship you what I have and contact you about shortages. I am usually able to ship out-of-stock items in about a week. Your payment is captured and finalized ON SHIP DATE- Until then, YOUR bank holds the purchase amount.Every customer is important and I do my best to make sure you are satisfied.
Thanks and Hammer ON!
