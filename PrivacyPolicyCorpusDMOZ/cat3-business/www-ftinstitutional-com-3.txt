You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.
Prohibited Uses and Means of Access
Prohibited Uses. Because all servers have limited capacity and are used by many people, you may not use the Site in any manner that could damage or overburden any Franklin Templeton server, or any network connected to any Franklin Templeton server. You may not use the Site in any manner that would interfere with any other party's use of the Site.
Means of Access. The Site is generally intended to be viewed by a conventional web browser with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels or greater, such as Microsoft® Internet Explorer® 7.0 or above, Firefox® 3.0 or above, or Safari® 3.0 and above. Although you may use other means to access the Site, be aware that the Site may not appear accurately through other access methods, and you use them only at your own risk. You are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure that you are receiving the most recent data. You should not access the Site through devices or services that are designed to provide high-speed, automated, repeated access, unless such devices are approved by us.
Password protected areas. Access to and use of password-protected and/or secure areas of the Site are restricted to authorized users only. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain unauthorized access to such parts of our Site, or to any other protected materials or information, through any means not intentionally made available by us for your specific use. Unauthorized individuals attempting to access, or actually accessing, these areas can be subject to criminal and/or civil prosecution.
Fund Prospectus Offer, Performance, and Investment Risks
Prospectus Offer. For more information on any of our funds offered in your state, contact your registered representative (financial advisor) or download a prospectus, which contains important information about a fund's investment goals, sales charges, expenses and risk considerations. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.
Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. One Franklin Parkway San Mateo, CA 94403-1906
Fund Performance. Investment return and principal value for our Funds will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Mutual funds, annuities and other investment products are not FDIC insured; are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by, any financial institution; and are subject to risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.
Investment Risks. All of the funds are subject to certain risks. Generally, investments offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk.
Stocks and other equities representing an ownership interest in a corporation have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term but tend to fluctuate more dramatically over the shorter term. Bonds, and other debt obligations, are affected by the creditworthiness of their issuers and changes in interest rates, with prices often declining as interest rates increase. High yield, lower rated ("junk") bonds generally have greater price swings and higher default risks. Foreign investing, especially in developing countries, has additional risks such as currency, market volatility, and political and social instability.
These risks, and other risks that particular funds may be subject to, such as specialized industry sectors or use of complex securities, are discussed in each fund's prospectus.
Privacy, Personal Information Transmission, Unsolicited Communications and Usage Monitoring
Privacy policy. For individual shareholders of our U.S.-based Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series Funds, please see our Privacy Policy for a summary of the non-public personal information that we may collect and maintain about current or former investors; our policy regarding the use of that information; and the measures we take to safeguard the information.

Franklin Templeton is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques obtained in your unsolicited Communications for any purpose including, but not limited to, developing and marketing products.

Third Party Content Providers, Sites, Referrals, and Disclaimers
Conditions may apply to third party content. Some of the products, services, content, including advertisements, tools, and information available through the Site may be provided by companies that are not affiliated with Franklin Templeton ("Third Party Content") and their source is clearly identified. In some cases, the Third Party Content may be framed-in on the Franklin Templeton Site or available through a link to a third party site. In the case of Third Party Content, there may be additional restrictions that apply to its use. You should be careful to examine them (for example, in accompanying statements or caveats or their posted terms of use) because they may be more restrictive than the restrictions Franklin Templeton imposes on our own, proprietary Site Content. Third Party Content providers may have reserved a right to modify the restrictions they impose on use of their content without notice. As with our Site's Terms of Use, use of Third Party Content after a change in the posted restrictions relating to that content will constitute acceptance of those changes.
Not responsible for Third Party Content, referrals or links to third parties or third party sites. For informational or educational purposes, or as a service and convenience to you, this Site may provide referral information, Third Party Content or live links to a regulatory agency, non-profit organization, or other unaffiliated third party and their websites, including companies that have a relationship with Franklin Templeton.
Our decision to provide referral information to a third party or to pass on an offer made by a third party vendor or to provide a link from our Site to a third party site is not an endorsement of the third party, their products or services, or their website accessed through any such links. While we would generally only provide such information from, or links to, sources considered reliable, we do not have the resources to conduct independent investigations and accordingly we make no representations or warranties as to third party products, services, content, tools and information, and do not guarantee their accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness. We advise and encourage you to do your own research. You will use Third Party Content only at your own risk.
Although Third Party Content may be displayed, framed-in or provided in a pop-up box on the Site, or available through a live link from our Site to a third party site, Franklin Templeton does not prepare, edit, guarantee or endorse Third Party Content. By clicking on a link from our Site to any third party site, you will leave this Site (even if, for your convenience, a second browser window is opened). When viewing Third Party Content through such a link, keep in mind that the third party's site terms and conditions, privacy and security policies, or other legal information may be different from those of Franklin Templeton's Site. We are not liable for any direct or indirect technical or system issues, consequences, or damages arising from your use of any third party website. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY, THEIR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THEIR WEBSITE, OR ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH SUCH THIRD PARTY SITES, NOR DO WE MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THIRD PARTY CONTENT (OR ITS ACCURACY) ON ANY THIRD PARTY SITES, AND WE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER IN RELATION TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

No reliance on Data. Reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure that Site Content, including account information and pricing data, are complete and accurate.

Cautions about future or "forward-looking" statements. Speculation or stated beliefs about future events, such as market and economic conditions, company or security performance, upcoming product offerings or other projections are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve risks and uncertainties. General business, market, economic and political conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we presently anticipate or project.
