Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from Lightlife®’s historical experience and its present expectations or projections. These risks include, but are not limited to, Lightlife®’s ability to finance expansion or acquisition plans, share repurchase programs and general operating activities; changes in the applicable business environment, including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; regulatory and legal changes; fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials; interest rate and currency fluctuations; changes in economic and political conditions; our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets; the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs; litigation uncertainties; adverse weather conditions; and other risks discussed in Lightlife®’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Lightlife® undertakes no obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Revisions to the Terms. Lightlife® may at any time, in its sole discretion and without notice, revise or modify this Legal Policy or the Privacy Policy. You are bound by any such revisions and should periodically visit this Site to review the current Legal Policy and Privacy Policy pages.

Furthermore, Lightlife® is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to the Site for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products using such information.

15. General Terms. This Legal Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and Lightlife® and governs your use of any Lightlife® Site.
