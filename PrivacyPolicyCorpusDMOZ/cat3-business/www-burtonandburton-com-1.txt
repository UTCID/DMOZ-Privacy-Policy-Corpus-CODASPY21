Do I have to own a business to purchase product from burton + BURTON®? No. burton + BURTON® has strictly been a business-to-business wholesale supplier for over 35 years but we are now open to consumer purchases. The pricing you see initially when browsing our site is for our consumer sales only. Businesses reselling our product may register and provide their State Sales and Use Tax Number (State and International requirements may vary) for our wholesale pricing.

Due to our rapid order turnaround, typically we are unable to add to orders that have already been submitted. Even orders sent at night go through an automated process to have them ready to pack when we get here in the morning. Please be certain to include everything you need before submitting.
What happens if I backorder products on your website? Do I pay for them when I order them?
You will not pay for any backordered merchandise until it ships. When a backordered product comes in-stock, we will call you. We prefer to speak with you before shipping in case you have something else to add to the order. Backorders will not be shipped without your approval.
How do I save an online order to finish later?
From your shopping cart, you have the option to add your order to a 'wishlist'. This will ensure your order gets saved in its entirety. From the cart, select the 'product' box in the heading of the order. This will select all of your items. Then, scroll to just below the last item on the order and select 'save to wishlist'. You will then have the option to name your wishlist for easy access later. Once you are ready to resume your order, open your wishlist and add the necessary items back into your cart.
Is there a minimum order requirement? Yes, for wholesale customers there is a $200 minimum opening order requirement and $75 minimum reorder. Reorders below $75 will incur a $5 service charge. We also have minimum order quantity requirements for Foil and Latex Balloons which are indicated below. For consumers, there is not a minimum order although you will still need to adhere to our set requirements as we do not break sets. For example, if a mug comes in a set of 6, you cannot only purchase one mug from us as you'll have to buy the 6. If you do not wish to buy the entire set, we encourage you to vist our Store Locator section to find a retailer in your area.
Foil Balloon minimum order requirements 18"-23" Balloons require a 6 per item number minimum and must be ordered in multiples of 6. (Some exceptions in 5)  24"-36" Balloons require a 3 per item number minimum, and must be ordered in multiples of 3. (Some exceptions) 2", 4", 5", 9", 12", 13", & 14" Air-fill Balloons-flat or preinflated require a 10 per item number minimum and must be ordered in multiples of 10.
Latex Balloon minimum order requirements 30" + 3' Giant Balloons require a 3 per item number minimum, and must be ordered in multiples of 3.
Foil Balloons 18" and larger sized foil balloons have self-sealing valves and do not require the use of a heat sealer.
The inks on foil balloons may run if they come in contact with water.
2-Sided denotes both sides of an 18" foil balloon have the same or complementary design. Foil balloons designated as 1-sided have silver or a solid color on the other side.
Packaged denotes 18" foil balloons are individually pre-packaged.
Measurements and Sizing Measurements for foil balloons listed under each product number are categories and should be used as a guide for the size. Due to variations in manufacturing processes, actual sizes may vary slightly.
Flat & Preinflated Balloons 2", 4", 5", 9", 12", 13", & 14" air-filled foil balloons ordered flat are not self-sealing and require the use of an electric air inflator and a heat sealer. Cups and sticks are sold separately.
2", 4", 5", 9", 12", 13", & 14" air-filled foil balloons ordered preinflated arrive air-filled with cups and sticks.
Do not put helium in non-valved foil balloons smaller than 18".
Do you Personalize Products?
Yes, please visit our custom imprints page for more information.
High Altitudes Certain foil balloons cannot float in a high altitude. If you are located at a high altitude, please consider the following:
Balloons that are 21" or larger are more likely to float in high altitudes than 18" balloons.
18" Balloons that have detailed designs use more inks, which may cause the balloons to be heavier and less likely to float in a high altitude. This is also true for all 2-sided, 18" designs.
18" round-shaped balloons generally float better than heart, star, or other shaped balloons.
Balloon weights and ribbons attached to balloons contribute to the floating ability.
Foil Balloon Volume Discounts Volume Discounts are determined by the total number of balloons ordered on each individual order, regardless of balloon size. This includes the total number of balloons ordered and not the amount ordered per product number. All "SALE" balloons and size categories are included as part of the cumulative total and apply toward the volume discount. 18" packaged assortments and 2"-14" air-filled balloons do not apply toward volume discounts.
If you order between 6-249 balloons, you will receive the first price listed on each balloon ordered.
If you order between 250-499 balloons, you will receive the second price listed on each balloon ordered.
If you order between 500-999 balloons, you will receive the third price listed on each balloon    ordered.
If you order 1,000 or more balloons, you will receive the fourth price listed on each balloon ordered.
The correct volume discount price of each balloon ordered is automatically calculated on your final invoice upon the total number of balloons on the order.
100 Discount Order 100 or more pieces of any single foil balloon style, in one size, and receive the lowest price listed.
Latex Discounts Latex discounts are determined by the total dollar amount of latex on each order. Latex orders totaling $250-$499 receive a 10% discount on the latex total and latex orders totaling $500 or more receive a 15% discount on the latex total. Party pack latex does not apply toward discount.
Mug Plush & Other Product Discounts Where applicable, case prices are listed under the regular price for mugs, plush, and other products.
Latex Balloon minimum order quantity requirements: 3' Giant Balloons require a 3 per item number minimum and must be ordered in multiples of 3.
