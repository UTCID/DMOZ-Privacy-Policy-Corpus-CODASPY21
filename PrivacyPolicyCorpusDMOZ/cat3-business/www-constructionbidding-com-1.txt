You authorize PlanHub to store this information and to send, share, and distribute this information with service providers. You understand that PlanHub will use this information to provide Services, to contact you should the need arise, to provide this information to service providers, and for related purposes.

When a service provider applies for membership, PlanHub takes basic steps to ascertain the credentials of the service provider. Steps may include, but will not necessarily include or be limited to, criminal checks, identity verification, sexual predator checks, and state-wide license verifications. All or part of this inquiry may be carried out by a third-party, and may rely partially or entirely on third-party data and data sources. The procedure may change from time to time, at the sole discretion of the PlanHub. PlanHub has no obligation whatsoever to conduct such inquiry, to confirm the accuracy of any data provided to it by third-party sources, or to undertake any independent investigation.

You agree and understand that the process is not error free, does not constitute a detailed background check, and is extremely limited in scope. You understand that, even if steps to ascertain the credentials of service providers are taken at the time a service provider registers with PlanHub, the status of the service provider may change over time. In addition, PlanHub relies to some degree on the representations of the service providers themselves. You agree and acknowledge that PlanHub has a right to rely on such information without independently verifying the same and without incurring any liability. Consequently, you understand and agree that it is solely your responsibility to research, ascertain, confirm and verify the license requirements, license status, qualifications, safety record, disciplinary record, insurance status, corporate status, bonding information, integrity, and other qualifications of a service provider. Determining whether a service provider is properly licensed to perform a specific task within a specific locality can be a complex task, and you should consult with the appropriate state agency, the county and local building departments, and other license authorities when making such a determination. In addition, you should ask for a copy of the license prior to entering into contract.
