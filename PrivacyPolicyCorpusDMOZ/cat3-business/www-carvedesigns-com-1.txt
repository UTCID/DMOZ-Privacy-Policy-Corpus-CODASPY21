Privacy Policy
Your privacy as a Carve Designs customer is important to us. Any personal information you provide to us on our web site is maintained in private files on our secure Web server and our internal systems. We collect information when you register or update your account, log-in, place an order, opt-in to receive our emails, shop online, or participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey. This information may include, but is not limited to, name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card information and phone number. Carve Designs will not sell, rent or share your email address with third parties to send you unsolicited email. When you place an order on carvedesigns.com, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address during checkout, you will also receive order and shipping confirmation emails. You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our web site or the public. The security of your information is very important to us. We use 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Carve Designs. Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following: • The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https" • Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section of the browser window. Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able to order through the Carve Designs web site. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page. While we implement these and other security measures on our site, please note that 100% security is not always possible.
