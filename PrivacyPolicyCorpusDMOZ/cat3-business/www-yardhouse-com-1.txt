TERMS OF USE:
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to the Company sites on which we have posted these Terms, including online, in-restaurant, mobile, or social locations (collectively, the "Sites"). The Sites are operated by Darden Corporation or our affiliates (collectively, "Darden or Company"). Throughout the Sites, the terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to Company. Company offers the Sites, including all information, tools and services available from the Sites, to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all the terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here.

Use of Materials on the Sites: All content on the Sites (including, without limitation, text, design, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio clips, downloads, interfaces, code and software, as well as the selection and arrangement thereof) is the exclusive property of and owned by Company, its licensors or its content providers and is protected by copyright, trademark and other applicable laws. Use of content on the Sites, including but not limited to the modification, distribution, transmission, performance, broadcast, publication, uploading, licensing, reverse engineering, transfer or sale of, or the creation of derivative works from, any material, information, software, products or services obtained from the Sites, or use of the Sites for purposes competitive to Company, is expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Company. Company reserves the right to refuse, terminate or cancel any person's registration for the Sites, and remove any person from the Sites or prohibit any person from using the Sites for any reason whatsoever. Termination of your access or use will not waive or affect any other right or relief to which Company may be entitled at law or in equity. Company, or its licensors or content providers, retain full and complete title to the material provided on the Sites, including all associated intellectual property rights, and provide this material to you under a license that is revocable at any time in Company's sole discretion. Company neither warrants nor represents that your use of materials on the Sites will not infringe rights of third parties not affiliated with Company.

You may not use any hardware or software intended to damage or interfere with the proper working of the Sites or to intercept any system, data or personal information from the Sites. You agree not to interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of the Sites in any way.
Materials You Submit: You acknowledge that you are responsible for any material you may submit via the Sites (including any components of the Sites administered by third parties, such as tools that allow you to interact with the Sites or through other social media platforms), including the legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality and copyright of any such material. You may not upload to, distribute or otherwise publish through the Sites any content that (i) is confidential, proprietary, false, fraudulent, libelous, defamatory, obscene, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, infringing on intellectual property rights, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable; (ii) may constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party or otherwise give rise to liability or violate any law; or (iii) may contain software viruses, political campaigning, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam." You may not use a false e-mail address or other identifying information, impersonate any person or entity or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any content. You may not upload commercial content onto the Sites.
If you do submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Company an unrestricted, nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute and display such material throughout the world in any media. You further agree that Company is free to use any ideas, concepts or know-how that you or individuals acting on your behalf provide to Company. You grant Company the right to use the name you submit in connection with such material, if they so choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all the rights to the content you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate any provision herein and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Company for all claims resulting from content you supply.
Conduct on the Sites: Some features that may be available on the Sites require registration. By registering at and in consideration of your use of the Sites, you agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and agree to our Privacy Notice.
Some features on the Sites require use of a password. You are responsible for protecting your password. You agree that you will be responsible for any and all statements made, and acts or omissions that occur, through the use of your password. If you have any reason to believe or become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password, notify Company immediately. Company may assume that any communications Company receives under your password have been made by you unless Company receives notice otherwise. You or third parties acting on your behalf are not allowed to frame the Sites or use our proprietary marks as meta tags, without our written consent. You may not use frames or utilize framing techniques or technology to enclose any content included on the Sites without Company's express written consent. Further, you may not utilize any Site content in any meta tags or any other "hidden text" techniques or technologies without Company's express written consent.

These links are provided as a convenience to you and as an additional avenue of access to the information contained therein. We have not necessarily reviewed all the information on those other sites and are not responsible for the content of those or any other sites or any products or services that may be offered through those or any other sites. Inclusion of links to other sites should not be viewed as an endorsement of the content of linked sites. Different terms and conditions may apply to your use of any linked sites. Company is not responsible for any losses, damages or other liabilities incurred as a result of your use of any linked sites.
Trademarks and Copyrights: Trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Sites are registered and unregistered trademarks of Company, its licensors or content providers, or other third parties.

YOUR USE OF THE SITES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SITES ARE PROVIDED ON AN

IMPLIED FROM A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR COURSE OF DEALING; THAT ACCESS TO

DISCRETION AND RISK. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH
MATERIALS. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY
YOU FROM DARDEN OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND. COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING
THE USE OF THE MATERIALS ON THE SITES IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPLETENESS,
CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, USEFULNESS, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY OR
OTHERWISE. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, THE LAW MAY NOT PERMIT THE DISCLAIMER
OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE
OF THE SITES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU SEND OR
RECEIVE DURING YOUR USE OF THE SITES MAY NOT BE SECURE AND MAY BE
INTERCEPTED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR

THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER DARDEN NOR ITS
SUPPLIERS OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SITES, OR ANY OTHER
SITES YOU ACCESS THROUGH A LINK FROM THE SITES OR FROM ANY ACTIONS WE TAKE
OR FAIL TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF COMMUNICATIONS YOU SEND TO US, OR THE DELAY
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
ADVERTISED IN OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITES, DARDEN'S REMOVAL OR DELETION
OF ANY MATERIALS SUBMITTED OR POSTED ON ITS SITES, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT

ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NEITHER DARDEN NOR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIABLE
FOR ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY USER OF THE SITES.
YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE CLAIMS OR ANY DISPUTE
WITH DARDEN IS TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SITES. YOU AND DARDEN AGREE
THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITES MUST
COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES OR THE CAUSE
OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, OR THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ALL OR A
PORTION OF THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Darden and its officers,
directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, service providers,
subcontractors and suppliers from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and court costs, arising or resulting from your use of the Sites and
any violation of these Terms of Use. If you cause a technical disruption of
the Sites or the systems transmitting the Sites to you or others, you agree
to be responsible for any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages
and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising or
resulting from that disruption. Darden reserves the right, at its own
expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate
with Darden in the defense of such matter.
JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW
The laws of the State of Florida govern these Terms of Use and your use of
the Sites, and you irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the courts
located in the County of Orange for any action arising out of or relating
to these Terms of Use. We recognize that it is possible for you to obtain
access to the Sites from any jurisdiction in the world, but we have no
practical ability to prevent such access. The Sites have been designed to
comply with the laws of the State of Florida and of the United States. If
any material on the Sites, or your use of the Sites, is contrary to the
laws of the place where you are when you access it, the Sites are not
intended for you, and we ask you not to use the Sites. You are responsible
for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with
them.
Disputes
You agree that by entering into these Terms, you and Company are each
waiving the right to trial by jury and the ability to participate in a
class action.
Any and all disputes Company or you has relating in any way to your
relationship with the Company (including without limitation with respect to
your transactions with the Company, Company's advertisements and
disclosures, email and mobile SMS (text) messages Company sends to you, or
the use or disclosure of any information about you), these Terms, privacy
notices, or terms of use, will be submitted to confidential arbitration in
the federal judicial district in which you reside, except to the extent
that you have, in any way, violated or threatened to violate any Company
intellectual property right. Program claims include claims based on
contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or the
Company's negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other
source of law.
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send to the Company, by
certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to
Company should be mailed to:
Attention: Legal
1000 Darden Center Drive
Orlando FL 32837
The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and
the specific relief sought. If you and we cannot reach an agreement to
resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you
or we may commence arbitration.
All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the
Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
arbitrator's award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
arbitration brought under, or with respect to, claims is to be joined to an
arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms whether
through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless Company and You
agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative,
private attorney general or class proceeding.
For arbitration claims you assert against Company in accordance with this
section (but not for any arbitration claim against you) Company will pay
all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator's fees and costs for
the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers,
experts, or witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been
required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court
(whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside. Unless
unlawful, Company will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyers', experts',
and witness fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims. The
arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Similarly, an
arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that
specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the
award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the
arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award
unless requested to do so by all parties.
To the extent permitted by law, you will not agree to act as a
representative or a private attorney general, or in any other
representative capacity, or participate as a member of a class of claimants
in any lawsuit against company in any court, or in arbitration, with
respect to any program claims. This section (confidential arbitration) will
survive the termination of the relationship between you and Company.
Company or you may seek injunctive relief only in any state or federal
court in Orange County, Florida, USA, and Company and you consent to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in Orange
County, Florida USA for injunctive relief purposes. The arbitrator shall
have no authority to issue injunctive relief.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, under no
circumstances is company liable for any incidental, indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages.
CHANGES TO THESE TERMS OF USE
Darden reserves the right in its sole discretion to change, modify, add or
remove any portion of these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time, by
posting revised terms on the relevant Sites. There is no duty on Darden to
send you additional methods of notice of changes. It is your responsibility
to check periodically for any changes we make to the Terms. Your continued
use of the Sites after that point signifies that you accept the changes.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND ADMISSIBILITY
This agreement and any policies or operating rules posted on the Sites
constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and Darden
with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written,
between the parties with respect to such subject matter. A printed version
of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
proceedings based on or relating to use of the Sites to the same extent and
subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
originally generated and maintained in printed form.
SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in place.
HOW TO CONTACT US
If you have any questions or comments about these Terms or the Sites,
please contact us by emailing us at: iplaw@darden.com.
