FREE Delivery Offers
Our FREE UK Delivery offers may incur a supplement fee if you are located in a higher rate delivery area. The supplement fee is the cost charged to us by the couriers on top of the usual delivery amount. For example if your delivery charge is £18+vat for your area we discount the usual delivery cost of say, £12+vat meaning all you pay is £4+vat you therefore still benefit by the same amount from this great offer. The majority of UK mainland addresses have no supplement and your goods are delivered free of charge without supplement.

For any items custom made, custom printed or non resalable we are unable to offer refunds in full. In the event of a problem with the goods we will endeavor to solve the problem by the most efficient solution to both parties. Transportation costs can not be refunded. If no agreement of a satisfactory solution can be reached we will offer a refund of 50% of the sale value, this will be credited when the goods reach our works and must be within 7 days of the delivery date. If the goods show signs of wear, or are not complete or not in origional packaging then no refund will apply.
Policy for dealing with unacceptable customer behaviour
At HFE Signs, we believe that our customers have a right to be heard, understood and respected.
We also believe that our staff have the right to work in a safe environment, free from any abuse, bad language or harm caused by others.
We expect all customers to treat our staff with courtesy and respect at all times.
In a small number of cases the actions of some customers become unacceptable because they involve abuse of our staff and/or our processes.
We do not view an action as unacceptable, just because a person is forceful or determined. However, we do consider actions that result in unreasonable demands and/or abusive behaviour or language to be unacceptable.
Where a customer is aggressive or abusive, we may decide to:
Advise the customer that we consider their actions offensive, unnecessary and unhelpful and ask them to stop.
End telephone calls / appointments / meetings.
Terminate all contact with the customer and refuse to do future business with them.
Notify the police, this will always be the case if physical violence is used or threatened.
Damaged Goods
Should you receive any parcel from us that contains damaged goods this MUST be reported to us on the day of delivery so we can action a claim on the courier and arrange replacements. Damaged goods MUST be signed for as 'Damaged'. If the goods are signed for as 'received in good condition then no claim can be made and we will be unable to replace or offer any refunds. If you are unable to check you MUST sign for them as Damaged or Unchecked. If any damaged goods have been used they are then considered as acceptable by you and will not be considered for replacement or refund. If a replacement is not a suitable solution the maximum refund available will be 50% of the value of the damaged item (excluding postage).
Weather Damage
HFE Signs cannot insure any products against weather damage. All signage can be damaged in excessive wind and weather conditions. PVC Banners, Flags & Pavement Signs are most vulnerable and should be temporarily removed if strong winds or severe weather is forecast.
Late Delivery
HFE Signs Ltd cannot offer any insurance against late delivery by the courier. Most consignments do get delivered on time and are booked with the courier on a 24hr service for UK Mainland. It is a rare occurrence where items get misrouted or are delivered late for whatever reason, however this can happen so it is best to allow an extra day or two. The next day service is not guaranteed by the courier, and the courier will not offer any compensation for late delivery. HFE Signs Ltd will not be liable for any loss caused by a late delivery, whether it be direct loss or consequential loss nor will any refunds be applicable if the goods are no longer required.
Consequential Loss
HFE Signs Ltd cannot offer any insurance nor accept any liability for costs or damages that may occur due to late delivery, faults, errors or any problems in relation to our products. We strongly recommend goods are ordered in time to allow for delays with us or the couriers and to allow time for any errors that may occur during the printing process to be rectified. If your goods are ordered late and do not reach you in time for your purpose or you have arranged contractors and your goods arrive too late, are damaged or have a fault in anyway we can not offer any compensation for this.
Signs & Banners Finished Sizes
Sign & Banner printers have a feed tolerance of  +/-5% although we do calibrate our printers frequently to keep within the +/- 5% levels. It is likely you will have a discrepancy in size, particularly over the longer side, the larger the sign or banner the greater the discrepancy will be, this is down to the feed tolerances on the printers. To put this into context for a 10m long sign or banner it will be anything between 9.5m  10.5m on a smaller banner of say 5m it will be between 4.75m  5.25m. Having said this the error is usually much less than the 5% quoted.
Generally speaking signs & banners are not critical to anything greater than 5% and this is considered acceptable with sign & banner printing.
