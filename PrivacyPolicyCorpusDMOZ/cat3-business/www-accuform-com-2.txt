Terms & Conditions of Use for Accuform & Accuform.com
Last updated: January 1, 2014Welcome to Accuform! That’s what you hear when contacting us by phone, and that’s the service we carry-forth to Accuform.com throughout each of your clicks.By using Accuform.com, you agree to these conditions. Please read these carefully, print if needed. Where “Buyer” is noted in this document, this refers to you as the Buyer. Where “seller”, “we” or “us” is used, that refers to Accuform.CUSTOMER SERVICETo place an order, or for general product and pricing information, quotes, or returns, contact customer service at 1.800.237.1001. See additional worldwide numbers below. Orders may also be placed online through this website. Online orders will be immediately processed by Accuform. If you are not an Accuform Distributor Partner, your contact information will be forwarded to one of our partners post-order.PRODUCT QUOTATIONSWe frequently quote on items, materials and large quantities not found within this website or our print catalog. For detailed quotations, contact customer service at 1.800.237.1001. See additional worldwide numbers below.ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERSAcceptance of orders, contrary terms, and acceptance of Buyer's order are conditioned upon Buyer's assent to the following terms and conditions. Any inconsistent provisions of any purchase order or other writing shall not constitute a part of the contract of sale. If any of these items are not acceptable to Buyer, Accuform must be notified immediately.PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONSProduct colors, material choices, and other specifications are subject to change without notice and may vary. Colors are reproduced as accurately as possible. Items may be discontinued at any time without notice.PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONSAccuform attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Accuform does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of Accuform.com is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Accuform itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.BILINGUAL PRODUCT DISCLAIMERWe make no warranty, expressed or implied that the translations throughout this website, and our print catalog, are in fact the dialect used within your geographic region. If you require a specific translation, please provide it in writing with your order. If we are asked to provide translation, it will be in the dialect of our choosing unless otherwise specifically directed.MATCHING OF COLORSProducts, and art proofs, are viewable by computers connected to the Internet. These computers may view Accuform products solely through their computer screens ("Monitors"). Monitors may be configured to display images and colors in a variety of ways, both through the use of hardware set-up and software set-up. There are many possible settings for Monitors and there is no true uniform standard to which all Monitors conform. What may look one way on one monitor, will look different on another.Further, computer monitors display images with light and use a standard known as RGB to do so. Accuform produces products in a variety of ways (CMYK, and others) that do not use light.As such, you agree that Accuform does not guarantee that the colors as they appear on the screen will look the same as the colors as they appear on the purchased product. Accuform works hard to make the colors on the screen be as true as possible to the printed colors, however, the differences in Monitors and the differences between light and pigment make it impossible to guarantee matching colors for all Users. Light at your workstation may also interfere with appearance of colors.ARTWORK PROOFSProofs are available upon request. Signed approval may be required prior to production. Requests for artwork proofs may delay shipment of your order. Artwork, type, films, dies, tapes, disks or other items supplied or designed by us shall remain our property.PRODUCT PRICINGPrices on this website, and within our print catalog, reflect list price cost in U.S. currency and are current at the time of publication. Prices do not include any freight or taxes. We reserve the right to change prices without notice. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Accuform is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.TAX: Taxes will be collected where applicable by law.SHIPPING OF YOUR ORDERREGULAR SHIPPING: Unless otherwise noted by Buyer, goods will be shipped via carriers of our choice, typically FedEx, UPS, Purolator (Canada). Contact us for specific shipping terms. Varying shipping terms may apply to Alaska, Hawaii, and Caribbean islands, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, Asia and Oceana. We are not responsible for incorrect address charges, and these charges will be billed. Due to regulatory requirements, me items must ship via ground.TRUCK SHIPMENTS (LTL - Less than Truckload): We are committed to getting items only transportable by truck to you in excellent condition, and in a timely manner.

To assist in providing advance notice on items that MUST ship by truck, we have identified those items with a truck icon throughout this catalog. If you do not have a preferred LTL carrier we will help determine the best carrier for your order. On occasion, large quantity orders may be more cost effective to ship via LTL carrier; in these instances you will be notified prior to shipment.DAMAGED SHIPMENTS: Buyer should inspect all items upon receipt. If damage occurs in transit, Buyer should note the extent of the damages on the packing slip and contact us immediately. Our responsibility for loss or damaged items ceases when the carrier accepts the products for shipment.RETURN AND REFUND POLICYYou agree that Accuform guarantees the products it sells are free from manufacturing defects and as such will be good for 30 days after purchase of the product.
