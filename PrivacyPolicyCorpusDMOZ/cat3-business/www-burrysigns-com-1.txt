DESIGN...
Frosting vinyl is great for creating privacy in your office or blocking unsightly views but it is capable of doing much more then that. You can make your office space truly unique incorporating a brand element or architectural detail in your window design? Frosting vinyl can be cut just like any other vinyl before applying it to the glass. This means you can brand your entrance door with your logo in frosting. Cut a pattern that picks up a decor detail in your office space or come up with something that is uniquely you. We have a design team at Burry Signs fully trained in Adobe Illustrator creating productions files to cut whatever you have in mind. If you are not sure what you want and need some suggestions one of our designs can visit your sight. If you need help taking measurements we can assist you with that as well.
MATERIALS...
Burry Signs has a long history with vinyl and therefore has tried and tested several different films. We have our favourites for cutting and others for blocking out areas. The costs of films very quite widely. Some have size limits. There is much to take into consideration then choosing your film. You may need to match up to already existing frosting in your space. Burry Signs experienced team can help you through this process. We have access to many supplier - including 3M. Between Burry Signs and our suppliers knowledge I am sure we can come up with the right film for you.
INSTALLATION...
Our team of installers are capable of large and small projects - one piece of glass or several floors of office space. It is all a matter of logistics and teamwork. If you need the Burry Signs team to work overnight to install your glass privacy film that can be arranged - often preferred.
