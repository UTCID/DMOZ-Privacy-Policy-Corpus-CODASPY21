Privacy Policy
ABI Research respects the privacy of all clients and interested parties who provide personal information, including contact information. When you provide ABI Research with personal contact data, it is entered into a proprietary database, which is used strictly by ABI Research for client outreach, news and information (if requested), and internal marketing purposes. ABI Research does not sell, distribute, or share its database. We do not market to our database on behalf of third parties unless a registrant has explicitly given us this permission. Our databases have strong protections in place to minimize the possibility of their being accessed by unauthorized parties.
ABI Research will regularly utilize contact information for the purpose of providing clients and potential clients with information about our products and services. We do this through a variety of channels, including direct mail, email and telephone contact. However, we maintain strict adherence to an "opt out" policy which gives any registrant in our database the option of expressly not having their personal contact information used for ABI Research marketing purposes. Registrants are given the opportunity to opt out through simple and direct responses to our marketing programs. With the exception of limited direct mail, most opt out requests will take effect immediately.
We welcome additional comments and suggestions regarding our privacy policy. If you have concerns or ideas, please click on the following link: privacy contact.
