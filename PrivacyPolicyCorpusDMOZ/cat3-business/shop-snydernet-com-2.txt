16. CONDITIONS OF ORDER
The website may include goods and services for sale to you through the website. The following additional terms apply to all offers for sale and sale of goods and services through the website:
16.1. Checkout Terms. All orders are subject to any additional terms presented to you at checkout. You are bound by these additional terms, which might include information such as, and without limitation, checkout confirmation, sales tax information, email order details, and customer service information. Where in conflict, any term set forth in at checkout shall supersede and control over the terms set forth in this Agreement. All such terms presented at checkout are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
16.2. Offer and Acceptance of Order. When you place an order, we may verify your method of payment, and/or shipping address before processing your order. Your placement of an order with us is an acceptance of our offer to sell our goods and services, subject to availability and pursuant to the terms contained in this Agreement. We, at our discretion, may complete your order by processing your payment, building the good, and shipping the good, or may, for any reason, decline to complete your order or any part of your order. No order shall be considered completed until the good has been shipped. If we decline to complete your order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address or other contact information you have provided with your order.
16.3. E-mail Confirmation. In order to provide you with the most up to date information regarding your order, our primary form of communication is via email. All order updates will be sent to the email address used when the order was placed. For this reason, you must use a valid email address when placing your order. If you have questions that need to be directed to our customer service team, you are welcome to contact us via email, chat or phone. You agree that we will not be responsible for any damage you incur, or information you do not receive, as a result of your failure to provide and maintain a valid email address or as a result of any failure of your email system, spam filters, or other impediments to your receipt of our communications
16.4. Payment. All orders must be placed online through the website using credit card payment. From the shopping cart, you have the option to check out using our secure server. We accept all credit cards as noted on our website, including and subject to change at any time without notice, Visa, American Express, MasterCard, and Discovery. We do not accept payment in the form of checks, bank drafts, wire transfers, or through PayPal or any other form except by credit card. Charges are billed to your credit card when your order is placed. You will be charged the full amount of your order including shipping at the time the order is placed even if the goods you order are shipped at different times. All payments and prices on the website are in United States dollars.
16.5. Build to Order and Shipment Times. Delivery and/or shipment dates provided in connection with any order are estimates only and do not represent fixed or guaranteed delivery dates. Goods for sale are generally built to order and lead times can vary based on many variables including our production schedule. Consequently, inventory information is not shown on the website and the website will calculate an estimated shipment date based on standard lead time information. We work internally and with our vendors to provide the best possible delivery estimates. There are some situations beyond our control, such as fire, flood, strike, or other labor difficulty, fuel scarcity, acts of God, weather, act of any governmental authority or of the purchaser, accidents or other delays or unavailability regarding in transportation, inability to obtain necessary labor, materials or manufacturing facilities from usual sources or due to any other cause beyond our reasonable control. In the event of delay in performance due to any cause, within our control or otherwise, the date of delivery will be postponed by such length of time as may be reasonably necessary to compensate for the delay. We cannot guarantee or ensure that any shipment can be made by any specific time or date. SNYDER DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, COSTS, OR LOSSES OF ANY TYPE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS, LOST REVENUE, OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR REPUTATION DUE TO ANY DELAY IN SHIPPING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LOSS WAS KNOWN OR FORESEEABLE TO SNYDER AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU GAVE NOTICE TO SNYDER OF SUCH POTENTIAL LOSS. After your order is placed you will receive an order acknowledgement email which includes the most up-to-date estimated shipping date. You may also contact Snyder to inquire about items in stock prior to order placement.
16.5.1. Arrangement for Shipping. If you so choose, Snyder will arrange shipping based on the destination information you provide to Snyder upon placement of your order. In certain instances, you may be able to arrange your own shipping at your expense by selecting “Customer-Arranged Pickup”, in these cases email and/or phone communication with us will be required to coordinate shipping.
16.5.2. Acceptance of Goods. It is your responsibility to inspect all shipments before accepting and signing any bill of lading, delivery receipt, or other acceptance of the goods. You are also responsible for unloading and unpacking any shipment. It is extremely important for you to to inspect and note any damages to any goods prior to accepting their delivery. All orders are inspected at the point of origin to make sure there is no damage when shipped. Once our goods are turned over to the carriers, damage can occur, and all risk of loss or damage shifts to you upon acceptance of delivery. If you do note damage of a shipment on the bill of lading or delivery receipt, we will gladly assist you to resolve the problem. If damage has occurred or items are missing, claims for damage, loss, or delay should be made to the designated carrier and then notify Snyder prior to putting the goods into service. No claims of any type regarding damaged or missing goods will be allowed unless reported to Snyder within 30 days of delivery.
16.5.3. Shipping Locations. Snyder has plants and shipping points in the following locations and the location where your ordered goods will be built and/or shipped is in the sole discretion of Snyder: Arkansas ( AR ), California ( CA ), Illinois ( IL ), Iowa ( IA ), Michigan ( MI ), Nebraska ( NE ), West Virginia ( WV ).
16.6. Order Cancellation, Modification, and Returns. You may cancel or modify an order at any time, subject to penalties and restrictions as set forth in this Agreement. If you cancel or modify the order within 24 hours, there will be no cancellation or modification fees and money we charged you for the cancelled good order will be refunded, or the difference in fees between the original order and a modified order will be reconciled by refunding or charging additional monies, as the case may be, against your payment method. Built to order, obsolete or custom manufactured good may not be returned, modified, or cancelled after 24 hours post-ordering. For non-built to order goods, if you cancel or modify an order after 24 hours, you will be charged with a $50 order processing fee. If you cancel or modify a non-built to order good order after the good has shipped, you will be charged our standard 25% restocking fee unless otherwise noted as a part of the return process and any freight charges from time of shipment, plus any additional fees, if applicable, due to reconciling fees between an original and modified order. All cancellation, order modification, and return requests must be submitted using the online form located at www.shop.snydernet.com/customer-support/order-cancellation-request.asp. PHONE, EMAIL, AND OTHER ATTEMPTS TO MODIFY, CANCEL, OR RETURN AN ORDER NOT SUBMITTED USING THE ONLINE FORM ARE NOT ACCEPTED. All goods must be pre-authorized by Snyder for return and issued Return Goods Authorization (“RGA”) number from Snyder. Any good returned to Snyder without a number from Snyder will be refused and returned to sender at your cost. Any good that is received in any condition other than new will have the cost of the renewal deducted from the amounts refunded. Refunds will be based on prices prevailing at the time of return, or invoiced price, whichever is lower.
16.7. Corrections. We make every effort to provide current and accurate information relating to the goods and prices, but do not guarantee the currency or accuracy of any such information. Information relating to goods is subject to change without notice. Prices are subject to change at any time prior to our completion of your order. In the event we discover a material error in the description or availability of a good that affects your outstanding order with us, or an error in pricing, we may notify you of the corrected version, and you may choose to accept the corrected version, or cancel the order. If you choose to cancel the order, and your credit card has already been charged for a purchase, we will issue a credit to your credit card in the amount of the charge. All prices are in U.S. dollars
16.8. Representations of Goods on Website. We attempt to display as accurately as possible the goods shown on the website including without limitation their colors, condition, parts, and accessories. However, because the colors you see will depend on many factors, including your monitor or printer, and what is pictured and the clarity and completeness of the picture depends on many photographic variables, we cannot guarantee that the color and accurateness of the good you see matches the actual good for sale. We try to use the closest representative image we can find for the good. These representative, illustrative images may show optional accessories or features, or may be an image of a similar good. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully read the good description and other related good literature such as technical drawings, instructions, or specifications before placing your order. If you have any questions or concerns about a good even after reading the description and good literature, please contact us. Some goods listed on the website may be generic, meaning we do not have a specific vendor name associated with the good. The good is therefore potentially sourced from a variety of vendors according to price and availability so we may both quickly and fairly accommodate your needs. We do our best in updating our site with any changes in the goods and there may be instances where there is a variance in the look and feel of the good due to a change in vendors. However, the intended application of the good will remain substantially the same. Please feel free to contact our customer service team with any questions prior to placing an order.
16.9. Warranties. If a warranty is available for a good, the details of the warranty are available in a downloadable PDF which can be found using a link labeled “Warranty” on the good’s page. All warranties are handled based on the manufacturer’s warranty policy. If problems arise with an item that is covered under warranty, the warranty process will be handled directly through the manufacturer or vendor of the item. Should a customer need help contacting a manufacturer or vendor about a warranty issue, please contact our customer service team. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ON THE WEBSITE AS SET FORTH ABOVE, ALL GOODS ARE SOLD ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS, AND WE MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ANY GOOD OR SERVICE, AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE GOODS AND SERVICES.
16.10. Indemnification for Use. In addition to and without restricting any other obligations to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless under this Agreement, you understand and agree that you are responsible for your use or inability to use the goods. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including, but not limited to, direct, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, exemplary, and indirect damages), and reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from or arising out of your use, misuse, or inability to use the goods.17. MISCELLANEOUS 17.1. The laws of the State of Nebraska shall apply to this Agreement, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods, and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, and any implementations thereof in various jurisdictions and any subsequent revisions thereto, shall not apply to these Terms of Use. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the website, its Services, or the Content (a “Dispute”) shall be brought solely in the state or federal courts located in Nebraska and you hereby irrevocably consent to exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. You further acknowledge that Snyder may seek equitable remedies against you such as a preliminary or permanent injunction and Snyder’ rights in its reputation and intellectual property are of a special, unique, extraordinary character, giving those rights peculiar value, the unauthorized use, damage, disclosure, or loss of which cannot be readily estimated and may not be adequately compensated for in monetary damages.17.2. If any part of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable, shall be modified by the court of competent jurisdiction to reflect to the maximum extent possible the original intention of the parties as reflected by the original wording, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.17.3. No waiver by Snyder of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.17.4. No rights, duties, agreements or obligations hereunder, may be assigned or transferred by operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Snyder.17.5. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Snyder as a result of this agreement or use of the website.17.6. Except as set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written between the user and Snyder with respect to the website or the Content.17.7. Snyder may revise this Agreement at any time by updating this posting.
