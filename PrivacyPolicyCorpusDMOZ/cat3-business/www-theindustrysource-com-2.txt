Security
Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) tngworldwide.com uses Secure Socket Layering (SSL) to tokenize your personal credit information, including your credit card number before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at tngworldwide.com is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone.
Our Safe Shopping Guarantee When you shop at tngworldwide.com, you are protected by our Safe Shopping Guarantee: If your credit card information is stolen because you used your credit card to make an online purchase from tngworldwide.com, we'll make sure you don't have to pay any fraudulent charges made to your account. Here's how it works:
If fraudulent charges are made to your credit card, you must notify your credit card company in accordance with its rules and procedures. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card company cannot require you to pay more than $50.00 of the fraudulent charges.
If your credit card company requires you to pay any part of this $50.00, then tngworldwide.com will reimburse you up to $50.00. We will do so only if the unauthorized use of your credit card number occurred because you used it to purchase something online through tngworldwide.com and only if you properly notified your credit card company.
Privacy
What information do we collect?
Generally, you may browse the website without providing any personally identifiable information. However, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information at various times and places on this website. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you may not be able to access all of this website or participate in all of its features.
We receive and store any personally identifiable information you enter on the website, when you shop with TNG Worldwide—online, or information you give us in any other way, such as by subscribing to our email, or contests.

Cookies, Web Beacons, and How We Use Them:
A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A "web beacon" or "pixel tag" or "clear gif" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer to a website
We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before clicking to NeimanMarcus.com. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.
We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.
