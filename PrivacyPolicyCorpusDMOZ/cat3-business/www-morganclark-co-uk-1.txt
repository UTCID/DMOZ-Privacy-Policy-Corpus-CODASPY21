Popular Questions
How much will this cost?-
In the majority of cases we are able to represent our clients without charging a fee at all. Read how we are able to offer our services free of charge by clicking here.
Doesn’t my insurance company manage my claim?+
While many insurance companies will support you in the initial weeks of your claim, their only responsibility is to ensure costs are covered to restore your property and replace damaged contents, stock, machinery etc. (if applicable). As your claim progresses, you will be left with the most stressful and time consuming day-to-day elements to organise and oversee alone if you do not appoint a Loss Assessor.
What’s the difference between a Loss Assessor and a Loss Adjuster?+
Loss Assessors and Loss Adjusters are both insurance claim professionals, but there is one key difference in their role during the insurance claim process; a Loss Assessor is appointed by and works exclusively for the policyholder, while a Loss Adjuster is appointed and paid by the insurance company. Loss Adjusters are expected to remain independent. Read more about the difference between Loss Assessors and Loss Adjusters here.
What will my insurance company think if I appoint a Loss Assessor?+
There is no reason why your insurance company or Loss Adjuster should discourage you from appointing your own Loss Assessor. If your Loss Adjuster is trying to dissuade you from using our services, you should question why they are against the idea of you being equally represented. After all, a Loss Assessor can only help a policyholder claim for what is legally within their insurance contract. Click here to read more about Loss Adjusters.

Customer reviews
Despite all the assurances from both my broker and insurer that they had made me the best possible offer, you were still able to secure a settlement that was more than double the figures they had originally proposed. I had no idea bringing you on board would make such a big difference to the settlement.
I won’t hesitate to call you. Thanks again for the great service.
