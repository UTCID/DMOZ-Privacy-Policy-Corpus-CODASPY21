Buying a house can be confusing, especially with some of the terms used. This glossary can help you understand the home buying process easier.
Amortization
A schedule on how the loan will be repaid, which typically includes amount borrowed, interest rate paid and term.
Appraisal
Written estimate of property’s current market value based on sales for comparable properties.
APR
Annual percentage rate; annual cost of loan that reflects interest, points paid, fees and mortgage insurance.
ARM
Adjustable rate mortgage; a mortgage with a fixed rate of interest for a short period of time, then adjusts based on an index.
Cash-out refinance
Refinance of mortgage to get money from home’s equity.
Clear title
Title free of liens and disputes.
Closing costs
Money needed to close the mortgage. These could include real estate, escrow or recording fees, transfer taxes or title insurance.
Debt-to-income ratio
What lenders use to determine if the borrower has the ability to repay the loan, comparing monthly payments to monthly income.
Earnest money
Money that lets buyer know you’re serious about the purchase; goes into escrow account and is credited toward purchase.
Escrow
An account borrowers are generally required to create for setting aside a percentage of the yearly taxes at loan closing. The lender manages the account, and it also contains additional money collected monthly, which is used to pay tax bills regularly.
FHA

Fixed-rate mortgage
A mortgage where the term of the loan and interest rate are negotiated and fixed for the duration of the loan.
Non-conforming loan
This is a loan that does not meet the general guidelines of government sponsored enterprises (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and is therefore usually kept by the lending institution and not sold. These types of loans are used when the borrowers are
self-employed, have unique income circumstance, or want to borrow outside the maximum loan amount. Examples of non-conforming loans are jumbo loans and bank statement loans.
Non-recourse loan
A loan that is secured by collateral, usually real estate property or equipment. Can be used by a self-directed IRA to purchase real estate property.
Origination fee
Cost of processing, underwriting and funding a mortgage loan.
PMI
Private mortgage insurance; is required for conventional loans with less than 20% down payment.
Points
Money paid upfront on a home loan to lower interest rate. Each point equals 1% of mortgage.
Principal
The amount borrowed from a lender for a home purchase.
Title insurance
Insurance obtained by the borrower to ensure that the property is clear of any liens.
Underwriting
The review process done by a lender to determine if the amount of risk under certain parameters is acceptable when offering a mortgage loan to a borrower.
