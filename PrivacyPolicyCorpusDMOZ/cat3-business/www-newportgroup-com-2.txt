Further, for authentication purposes, certain features on this site may require you to answer a designated security question. You agree to provide Newport with current, complete, and accurate information about you as prompted by the applicable registration process and agree to regularly update this information to maintain its completeness and accuracy. You agree to use this site to access only those accounts on which you are authorized to act, and you agree to use your own user names, logins, passwords, and security questions and answers when accessing accounts on which you are authorized to act.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account information, user names, logins, passwords, and security questions and answers that you use to access any page or feature on this site, and for logging off of your account and any protected areas of the site. Further, you are fully responsible for all activities occurring under your accounts, user names, logins, passwords, and security questions and answers that result from your negligence, carelessness, misconduct, or failure to use or maintain appropriate security measures.

USER RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVICES AND DATA TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE INTERNET
This website is accessible by computers including desktops and mobile devices with internet access (referred to generally as "Devices"). Financial and other transactions are not supported in the mobile version of our sites at this time.
Data hosted on and transmitted to and from Newport's websites are encrypted. If you use a wireless connection, your service provider may need to de-encrypt downloaded information and encrypt your transmissions. Because there may be a brief moment during which your personal information may not be encrypted, you should only use wireless networks operated by wireless service providers that you trust.
Certain portions of this website may offer you the ability to e-mail a message to Newport. E-mail functionality, if any, is provided to you to facilitate certain communications between you and Newport. However, because these communications are not generally encrypted or secured, Newport will not accept transactional instructions via e-mail. Accordingly, you agree that you will not use e-mail to request, authorize or effect the purchase or sale of any securities or other product or service, to change your address or other account information, to change your User Codes, to transmit personal credit information (including credit card numbers), to send fund transfer instructions, or for any other financial transactions that require formal authorization in accordance with applicable law or policies and procedures of Newport. Any such requests, orders, or instructions that you send to Newport by e-mail will not be accepted or processed. Newport shall have no liability for any loss or damage that arises from e-mail requests, orders or instructions sent in violation of this provision. Moreover, Newport shall have no liability for any loss or damage that results from interception and/or unauthorized use by third parties of any information you send by e-mail.
In addition, you agree that under no circumstances will you e-mail non-public personal information to us.
You are responsible for the data security of your Devices, including maintaining physical control over your Devices and protecting the data on your Devices. You are also responsible for the manner in which you obtain internet access, including the selection of their internet service provider, use of a wired or wireless connection, and any access over unsecured networks. Newport is not an internet service provider and does not maintain a wired or wireless network for your use. Although data in transmission is encrypted, Newport has no control over data in transit to or from its websites and cannot guarantee the privacy or security of data in transit or the speed or reliability of transmissions over internet connections. The possibility of an interrupted or delayed transmission should be considered when transmitting time-sensitive instructions to our websites. BY ACCESSING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TO SECURE YOUR DEVICES AND ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED ON OR ACCESSED BY THAT DEVICE.
Please refer to our Privacy Policy and Security Policy, the terms of which are incorporated into and made a part of these Terms and Conditions, for additional information.
