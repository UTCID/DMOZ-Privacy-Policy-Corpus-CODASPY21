Prices and terms are liable to change without notice. All shipments will be made at prices prevailing at time of shipment. Orders requesting shipment beyond delivery schedules may be assessed a price increase.
SHIPPING
All products ship F.O.B. Factory at the customer's expense unless otherwise quoted. Certain products will need to ship by common carrier and we will choose the best way unless otherwise requested.

We reserve the right to hold shipment of all open orders to customers whose account is past due.

All orders are considered a firm order and cannot be canceled without our approval. All returns and cancellations must be authorized in advance and are subject to round trip shipping charges and restock fees. Materials being returned must be in salable condition and should be insured. Customers are responsible for all materials invoiced. Browncor issues cancellation numbers to our customers. If you need to cancel an order, call customer service at 1-800-327-2278 and obtain your cancellation number. If product has shipped, or a custom order is in process we may not be able to fulfill your request.
DAMAGED GOODS
Please inspect merchandise immediately upon delivery and report any damage. Damaged or lost merchandise claims must be filed with the carrier within 10 days of receipt of goods. Once the product leaves any of our warehouses it becomes the property of the customer. Please follow these steps when receiving products:
Check your counts. If you are short a package, please note it on the carrier's delivery receipt.
Give a detailed inspection for damage. If the carton even appears to have damage anywhere, make sure you open and inspect your goods thoroughly. If there is damage, note it on the delivery receipt and call customer service immediately. PLEASE NOTE DAMAGE ON DELIVERY RECEIPT BUT DON'T REFUSE THE SHIPMENT!

Browncor will not be held responsible for any discrepancies overlooked during the customers' review process.
RETURNS
No returns will be accepted without a Return Authorization Number. Please call the customer service department with the return request. If the product shipped is the product ordered we may request a restocking fee of up to 30%. However, custom products and some special ordered products are not returnable. All returns will be shipped back at the customer's expense, unless otherwise agreed upon.
