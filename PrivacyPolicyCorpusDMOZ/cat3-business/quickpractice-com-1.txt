Privacy Policy
Following is the PracticePRO Software Systems® Web Site Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using this site.
Overview
Privacy is important to PracticePRO
Software Systems Incorporated (” PracticePRO
Software Systems”), a responsible participant in the healthcare industry. PracticePRO
Software System’s corporate policy is to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our customers and those individuals whose healthcare information may be identified within the transaction data services supplied by PracticePRO
Software Systems to our customers. This Privacy Policy describes what information PracticePRO
Software Systems collects and how that information is protected and used.
Privacy Principles
PracticePRO Software Systems operates under the following set of strict privacy principles:
The only information PracticePRO
Software Systems obtains about an individual visitor to its web site is information supplied voluntarily by that visitor.
Information supplied by a visitor that could be used to identify or contact that visitor, such as name, e-mail address or other similar information (“Personal Information”), will not be disclosed to anyone unless the visitor indicates that PracticePRO
Software Systems may do so.
PracticePRO Medical Record Software Systems may share statistical information about its visitors as a group, such as usage habits, demographics and similar information that cannot be used to identify or contact visitors (“Aggregate Information”), with any partner of PracticePRO
Software Systems. However, PracticePRO
Software Systems will not share Personal Information about a visitor at any time without the visitor’s permission. Personal Information about an individual contained within e-health transactions, reports and other summaries derived from e-health transactions, or within administrative information necessary to conduct e-health transactions, that can be used to identify or contact that individual will be protected by PracticePRO
Software Systems as “Individually Identifiable Health Information” in accordance with the requirements and definitions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) of 1996 (Public Law 104-191) and any implementing regulations.
PracticePRO
Software Systems will also observe all other state and federal laws relating to transmission, storage, and access to medical records and other healthcare data.
The following describes our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site:

Except as set forth herein, PracticePRO Software Systems will not disclose to unaffiliated companies any Personal Information about our visitors and customers. Any Personal Information provided to entities affiliated with PracticePRO
Software Systems will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this document, PracticePRO
Software Systems will not disclose to unaffiliated companies any Personal Information contained within payment processing or e-health transactions. Any Personal Information provided to entities affiliated with PracticePRO
Software Systems will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. PracticePRO

Registration
The PracticePRO Software Systems site requires visitors to register either before accessing the web site or as a requirement to access specific portions of the web site. Registration includes the collection of contact information such as visitor name and e-mail address.
IP Addresses
An IP address is a number assigned to your computer for accessing the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. PracticePRO
Software Systems collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests pages from the PracticePRO
Software Systems web site, the PracticePRO
Software Systems servers enter the visitor’s IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, PracticePRO
Software Systems does not associate IP addresses with records containing Personal Information. However, PracticePRO
Software Systems will use IP addresses to identify any visitors who refuse to comply with PracticePRO
Software Systems terms of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, or customers.
