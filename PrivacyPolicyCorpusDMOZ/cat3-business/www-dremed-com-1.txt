Ordering from DRE
We will provide a formal, written price quotation confirming an informal verbal or emailed price. This can be communicated by email, fax, or postal mail. Due to the nature of our business, all equipment quoted is subject to availability and/or prior sale.
DRE also works with customers who have medical equipment available for trade-in. Ask your DRE sales representative about this option.
When you are ready to order, please contact us to confirm current prices, payment arrangement, availability, and delivery time of your medical equipment or accessories. Whenever possible, we request a hard copy purchase order to ensure that your order is processed properly.
Warranty Protection
This warranty is given in place of all other warranties, expressed or implied. No statement or claim about the product by an employee, agent, or dealer of DRE shall constitute a warranty by DRE or give rise to any liability or obligation of DRE.
DRE, Inc. warranties its equipment to be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and with appropriate maintenance. Length of warranty varies from product to product, please ask your DRE representative for specific warranty coverage. For plastics, rubber or other expendable items, DRE warrants only that such parts will be free of defects in materials and workmanship at the time of purchase.
We will repair or replace any defective item or parts covered under the warranty that are returned to us within the warranty period. The following information is required: RMA number (call DRE to obtain), a letter stating the problem, serial number, and copy of invoice or, in lieu of invoice, the purchaser's name, date of purchase, phone number and address.
Equipment that has been damaged is excluded from this warranty and will be repaired for a fee. Please contact your freight company to submit any claims for shipping damage.
Please do not have your equipment repaired by a third party without prior written authorization. Doing so may void your original warranty.
Extended Warranty Available
In some areas, where we have properly trained, certified, and equipped Authorized Service Representatives, we may be able to offer you an Extended Warranty for your equipment. Upon expiration of our warranty, you may obtain preventive maintenance and repairs from the original manufacturer or from any organization of your choice.
Return Policy
A Customer Service Representative must authorize all returns and issue an RMA number (Return Merchandise Authorization). The following information should be available:
Reason for return
Product model number and quantity
Customer name and copy of sales order or invoice
Eligibility
Requests for returns due to customer error will only be accepted 30 days after original shipment date (a 40% or more restocking fee will be charged).
Merchandise must be properly packaged in the original shipping carton, if possible, to avoid freight damage. Credit will not be given for items damaged due to improper packaging or freight damage.
Customers must obtain an RMA number from a DRE representative and display this number on the outside of the package.
D.R.E. reserves the right to determine in its sole discretion whether an item will be accepted: as a warranty return, for quality issues, or as damaged goods.
Charges & Handling of Credits
All returns, regardless of whether the returns are determined to be legitimate, are subject to a handling/restocking fee of 40% of the sale price of the item.
All returns are subject to inspection to determine condition of merchandise prior to issuance of credit.
An additional fee of 20% of the original sale price will be charged for returned items that contain customer markings, stickers, or require repackaging to be returned to saleable condition.
Freight/shipping charges associated with the returned merchandise from the original order will not be credited. Freight for returned merchandise must be shipped pre-paid freight (collect shipments will be refused).
