SURVIVAL
The following provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service: No Warranty from ATLASLS.COM, Limitation of Liability, Indemnity and General Provisions.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
You agree that ATLASLS.COM and its licensors may make improvements and/or changes in the Site Content and services or events described in this Site, if any, at any time without notice and without liability to you of any kind. You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws, keeping in mind that access to the ATLASLS.COM SITE may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect. The failure of ATLASLS.COM to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by ATLASLS.COM in writing. The Terms of Service, along with the ATLASLS.COM Privacy Policy, comprises the entire agreement between you and ATLASLS.COM and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, if any, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. These Terms of Service are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms of Service to anyone without the express written permission of ATLASLS.COM. Any attempt by you to assign, transfer, or delegate these Terms of Service without the express written permission of ATLASLS.COM shall be null and void. These Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of ATLASLS.COM’s successors, assigns, and licensors. The paragraph headings in these Terms of Service, shown in boldface type, are included to help make the agreement easier to read and have no binding effect.
DISPUTES
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any ATLASLS.COM Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by ATLASLS.COM will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to ATLASLS.COM. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
APPLICABLE LAW
By using any ATLASLS.COM Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and ATLASLS.COM.
If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us.
