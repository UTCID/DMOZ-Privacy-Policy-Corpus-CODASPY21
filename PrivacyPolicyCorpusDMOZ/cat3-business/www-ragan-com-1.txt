Ragan may, however, use “cookies” to collect information about how our site is used. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to a Ragan banner ad or e-mail may be collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for the purpose of measuring response rates to banner ads and e-mail offers. Registration for Online Products and Services.

Information Use
We may use information you have given us or a company we partner with to, for example, provide a service, ensure proper product deliveries or billing, measure consumer interest in our various services and inform you about products and services. If you have provided your e-mail address to us or to a company we’ve partnered with to make their products and services available to you, you consent to receiving marketing and promotional emails and offers. We may also send you e-mail offers if you have provided your e-mail address to a third party and have actively chosen or requested, on an opt-in basis, to receive e-mail offers from other parties. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences as well as information available from external sources. These e-mail offers come directly from Ragan. You can opt out from receiving e-mail offers from Ragan Communications as described below in the section, Declining e-mail offers. When we send e-mails to you, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich HTML e-mails. If your e-mail address is HTML-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich HTML e-mails. Please note that we do not provide your e-mail address to Ragan business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our Ragan business partners. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from a Ragan business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send offers to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future offers from them.

Ragan provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving marketing and promotional emails and offers. Although some customers will appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices.

You may also change your preferences online, via the My Account page if you are a subscriber.
