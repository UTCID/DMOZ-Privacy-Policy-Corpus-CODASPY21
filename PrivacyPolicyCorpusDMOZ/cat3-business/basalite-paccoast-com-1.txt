Product Information
Basalite contains information on a wide variety of products and services. We also provide links to customers, associations and manufacturer sites for additional information on their products and services. While we try to ensure that these sites adhere to a privacy policy that is consistent with this policy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other websites and do not make any representations regarding how such sites use customer information.

Use of CookiesOur site uses cookies to keep track of how customers are navigating our site and to provide you with personalized content. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If so, we will use a cookie to remember the login information you gave us so you don't have to enter that information each time you visit our site. If your browser is set to refuse cookies, you will be required to manually enter your login information to activate our Toolbox feature. If you are using a shared machine in a corporate or other environment, you should always log-out of your session to prevent unauthorized use of your personal information.
Definition of a Cookie A message given to a web browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly prepare customized web pages for them. When you enter a website using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as your name and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your web browser, which stores it for later use. The next time you go to the same website, your browser will send the cookie to the web server. The server can use this information to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page you might see a welcome page with your name on it.
The name cookie derives from UNIX objects called magic cookies. These are tokens that are attached to a user or program and change depending on the areas entered by the user or program. Cookies are also sometimes called persistent cookies because they typically stay in the browser for long periods of time
