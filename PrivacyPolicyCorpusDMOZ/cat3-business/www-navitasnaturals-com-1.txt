Navitas Organics Terms And Conditions
Last Updated: 3/19/19
Welcome to the Navitas Organics website and related interactive features, products, services, applications or downloads (collectively, the “Website”) that is owned by Navitas LLC, d/b/a Navitas Organics (“Navitas,” “we” and “us).  These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) apply to our Website regardless of how you access or use it, including through mobile devices.
BY USING OUR WEBSITE YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THESE TERMS AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.  WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR AMEND THESE TERMS FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF OUR WEBSITE OR ANY AFFILIATE WEBSITE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES TO THESE TERMS WILL MEAN YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.
If you have any questions or comments, we invite you to contact us.
Privacy Policy
Information collection and use, including the collection and use of personally identifiable information, is governed by our Privacy Policy which is incorporated into and is a part of these Terms.
Product Sales, Fulfillment, and Availability
Details of the Navitas products available for purchase are set out on the Website.  All prices are displayed and charged in US dollars.  All applicable sales and other taxes are in addition to the sale price.  All online transaction totals reflect the estimated tax amount; the actual tax amount will be calculated based on your shipping location and may vary from the estimated tax.  Discounts and sales prices may not be applied to previous orders.  We reserve the right to shorten the duration of any special order or sales promotion.  All features, content, specifications, products and prices of Navitas products described or depicted on this Website are subject to change at any time without notice.  Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only.  Packaging may vary from that shown.  We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors.  The inclusion of any Navitas products on this Website at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products will be available at any time.  Occasionally, the manufacture or distribution of a certain Navitas product may be delayed for a number of reasons.  In such event, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the delay and keep you informed of the revised delivery schedule.  By placing an order, you represent that the Navitas products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.
You may only purchase Navitas products from this Website to be delivered to an address located in the United States.  Navitas makes no representation or guarantees that products available on the Website are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing the Website from territories where its contents are illegal or unlawful is prohibited.  It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from this Website.
Navitas reserves the right to fulfill or refuse to fulfill the orders of Navitas products made by any customer, including but not limited to any order that Navitas has cause to believe is for onward sale other than through distribution channels approved by Navitas.  You may only purchase Navitas products for personal, non-commercial use, unless you have entered into a prior written agreement with Navitas permitting such other use (for example, to act as a wholesaler or reseller of Navitas products).  In the event of refusal of fulfillment, Navitas will communicate to you the reason for the refusal and issue a refund of the amount paid for the given order.
Shipping and Return Policies
Navitas uses third party shipping carriers, and retains the exclusive right to determine which shipping carriers may be available to ship Navitas products purchased through this Website.  Orders will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on this Website and shipping charges may apply.  Risk of loss and title for items purchased from this Website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier.  You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged or lost shipments.  Signature may be required for deliveries.  Navitas does not guarantee any particular delivery date and is not responsible for any delays.
You may return or exchange a product purchased from this Website in the event that the product or service is defective or for any reason within 30 days.  Certain jurisdictions may provide additional statutory rights.  Nothing herein is meant to limit your return or cancellation rights under applicable local law.  In the event that the return or exchange is due to an incorrect order or faulty product, Navitas will be responsible for the shipping costs associated with such return.  In all other cases, you will be responsible for the return.  Navitas will only accept returns or exchanges of purchased products that comply with the process detailed in our Return Policy.
Fees and Promotion Codes
For all charges for any products sold on the Website, Navitas or its vendors or agents will bill your credit card or alternative payment method offered by Navitas.  You agree to provide valid and updated payment information and you agree to pay all such charges.  When you provide credit card information or other information necessary to facilitate payment to us or our vendors, you represent that you are the authorized user of the credit card or alternative payment method that is used to pay for the products.  In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you agree to reimburse Navitas and its vendors or agents for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses.   You are responsible for purchase of, and payment of charges for, all Internet access services and telecommunications services needed for use of the Website.
On occasion, Navitas may issue promotion codes that may be redeemed at the time of check out.  These codes are non-transferable and may only be used by the intended recipient; these codes have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash.  We reserve the right to cancel any promotion code and reduction redemption when the total value of the promotional code exceeds the price of the item.   Multiple promotional codes may not be combined.   Navitas is not responsible for any financial loss arising out of our refusal, cancellation, or withdrawal of a promotion or any failure or inability of a customer to use a promotional code for any reason.
Copyright, Trademark, and Ownership
All of the content displayed on the Website, including without limitation text, graphics, photographs, images, moving images, sound, and illustrations ("Content"), is owned by Navitas, its licensors, agents or its Content providers.  All elements of the Website, including, without limitation, the Website’s general design, Navitas’ trademarks, service marks, trade names (including the Navitas’ name, logos, the Website name, and  the Website design), and other Content, are protected by trade dress, copyright, moral rights, trademark and other laws relating to intellectual property rights.  The Website may only be used for the intended purpose for which it is being made available.  Except as may be otherwise indicated on the Website, you are authorized to view, play, print and download documents, audio and video found on our Website for personal, informational, and non-commercial purposes only.  You may not use, copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, or modify the Content or the Navitas’ trademarks in any way, including in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of materials on the Website, without Navitas’ prior written consent.

In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice.  While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service.  We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service or to refuse service to any customer.   We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance or shipment of any order.
