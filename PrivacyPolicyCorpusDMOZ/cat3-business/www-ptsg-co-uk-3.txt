The iAero (Yeovil) Centre Project will deliver a purpose-built 2,398 m² research, design and innovation facility to support the competitiveness and growth of the aerospace and associated high-value design and engineering technology supply chains in the area.
The Centre is receiving up to £3,049,240 of funding from the England European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of the European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme 2014-2020.
