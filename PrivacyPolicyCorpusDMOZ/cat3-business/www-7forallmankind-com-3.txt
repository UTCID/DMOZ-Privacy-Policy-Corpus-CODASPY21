Do you offer Gift Cards?
We do not offer gift cards at this time, but hope to soon. Please check back.
Do you offer Gift Services?
Unfortunately we cannot offer gift services at this time.
Why should I become a registered user?
There are multiple reasons to register on our site. You won't have to re-enter your credit card, shipping or billing information; when you place an order they will be filled in automatically. Also, registering makes gift giving simple. Your family and friends' information can be saved in your Address Book, so you avoid typing in their information each time you send a gift.
How do I change or cancel an order?
Confirmed orders cannot be cancelled or modified once they have been successfully submitted. We advise you to follow the return instructions included in your package, or refuse the shipment upon delivery, and it will be returned to our attention. Please allow 7 to 10 business days for your refund to be processed once it arrives to our warehouse.
Will my credit card be charged immediately?
No. Your credit card will not be charged until your order is shipped. Please be aware; as we process your order, you will see a pending authorization to ensure funds are available, not an actual charge.
What are my payment options?
We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and PayPal. All prices are listed in USD unless otherwise noted. Gift cards cannot be used to purchase other gift cards.
Are purchases on this website really tax free?
We collect sales tax only in states where we have a physical presence. Currently, sales tax only applies to the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.
Is ordering over the internet secure?
Yes. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used for every transaction in order to ensure that your order is secure. SSL encrypts the transmissions from our ecommerce servers as well as your computer. SSL encryption works by forming a matched pair with the transmission from your computer transmission and our server, so that only data to and from these sources can be valid.

What are some useful tips when caring for your items?
Classic Jeans
Before the first few washings, our classic dye may rub off on light-colored fabric, upholstery, and leather, so use care when wearing your jeans. With repeated wearing and washing, the classic color will pleasantly fade. Do not wash or dry classic garments with white or light colors.  Do not bleach. To make the color last longer, wash inside out with cold water and like colors.
Tumble dry low.
Remove promptly.
Do not iron.
Coated
To maintain coating, minimal (environmentally friendly) dry cleaning is recommended.
Corduroy
Wash inside out in cold water with like colors. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low. Remove promptly. Do not iron. Do not pull on belt loops when wearing this style.
Leather
Leather garments should always be professionally cleaned. Garments should be stored in an unzipped bag and kept away from sunlight, if possible, to prevent fading.
Velvet
Wash inside out in cold water with like colors. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low. Remove promptly. Do not iron. Do not pull on belt loops when wearing this style.
