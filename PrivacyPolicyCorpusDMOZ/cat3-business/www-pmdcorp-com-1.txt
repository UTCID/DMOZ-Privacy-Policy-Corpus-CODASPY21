Navigational Information
4.1. Cookies Performance Motion Devices, Inc. and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Website, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the PMD Inc. Performance Motion Devices keeps track of the Website and pages you visit within PMD Inc., in order to determine what portion of the PMD Inc. Website is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the PMD Inc. Website to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
4.2. Log Files We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personal information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, internet service provider (ISP), the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, clickstream data, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by PMD Inc. to provide general statistics regarding use of the PMD Inc. Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
4.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers' Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Opting Out and Unsubscribing".
4.4. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as "Flash cookies." PMD Inc. does not use Flash cookies. However, our customers of our software platform may create pages on the PMD Inc. platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies.  PMD Inc. does not have access or control over our customers' Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site directly here.
The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our Privacy Policy.  We do not have control over third party cookies or trackers our customers use.
4.5. Advertising We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: http://preferences.truste.com/ (or if located in the European Union, by clicking here: http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.
4.6. Third Party Tracking Technologies The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
