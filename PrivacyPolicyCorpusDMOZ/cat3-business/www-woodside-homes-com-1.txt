18.	BINDING ARBITRATION
18.1.
Arbitration Procedures. You and Woodside agree that, except as provided in Section 18.4 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this Agreement (each a "Claim"), will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "JAMS Rules") and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Binding Arbitration Section and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Binding Arbitration Section will control and prevail.
18.2.
Except as otherwise set forth in Section 18.4 below, You may seek any non-injunctive remedies available to You under state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both You and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) You and Woodside may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator's decision will be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.
BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND WOODSIDE HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
18.3.
Location. The arbitration will be conducted in Salt Lake County, Utah, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.
18.4.
Limitations. You and Woodside agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Woodside and You individually. YOU AND WOODSIDE AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION WILL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
18.5.
Exceptions to Arbitration. You and Woodside agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Your or Woodside's intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration with the other party's consent.
18.6.
Arbitration Fees. The party seeking the Claim is responsible for the initial fees to JAMS. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.
18.7.
Severability. You and Woodside agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable, except any portion of Section 18.4, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the Section will be given full force and effect. If Section 18.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither You nor Woodside will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim will be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the Salt Lake County, Utah and You and Woodside agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
19.	Severability
If any term of this Agreement is declared unlawful, void or unenforceable by any court in any jurisdiction, then such term will be deemed severable from the remaining terms in such jurisdiction and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms.
20.	Termination of Service
We may suspend or terminate Your right to access secured portions of the Website at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms and/or is harmful to other users of the Website, to us, to our partners, to the contributors, to the business of our Internet service provider, or to other information providers.
