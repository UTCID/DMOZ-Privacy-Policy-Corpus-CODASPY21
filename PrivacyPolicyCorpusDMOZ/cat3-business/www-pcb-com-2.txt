PRIVACY NOTICE | 1 July 2019
MTS Systems Corporation is a global company with its headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA. MTS Systems Corporation has many subsidiary and affiliate companies located in many different countries. This notice applies to MTS Systems Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates that may obtain Personal Data. You can find details about MTS Systems Corporation and its relevant subsidiaries and affiliates in the table below. The entity with which you engage will be responsible for your Personal Data. MTS Systems Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively shall be referred to as “MTS” in this notice.
Please note that MTS’s websites may contain links to third-party websites. The privacy practices of those websites are controlled by third parties, not MTS. Please review their privacy policies carefully.
You can contact privacy@mts.com if you have an inquiry or question related to this notice.
Why does MTS process your Personal Data?
MTS may use the Personal Data we collect to process orders, respond to queries, determine buying trends, provide a more personalized experience on our website, and for any other permissible use under applicable law, as discussed below.
What types of Personal Data does MTS collect?
“Personal Data” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
MTS processes the following categories of Personal Data:
Identification data such as name and contact information;
Professional data such as company information, number of employees and other business related information;
Page view information, navigation information, log information; and
Information about your IP address and browser.
How MTS processes Personal Data you actively provide to us:
Programs, Polls and Surveys: When a user registers for certain MTS programs and services, including to receive a newsletter, the user may be asked to provide Personal Data including name and contact information, company, or demographic information (e.g., geographic location, industry, number of employees and other business related information). Also, MTS may offer surveys in which users are asked to indicate their opinions or preferences. MTS processes the data you provide in order to deliver information, services, and/or products you request, (legal basis: Article 6(1) a. and/or b. GDPR).
Marketing and business development: Subject to consent as may be required by applicable law, MTS also uses data collected on our websites or at trade shows or trade fairs for the purpose of providing users with marketing information via mail or email, (legal basis: Article 6(1) a. and f. GDPR). Users may opt-out of receiving messages at any time by clicking an “unsubscribe” link contained in any promotional or other emails that we send to users. Opt-out requests will be processed without undue delay.
Customer and Technical Support: MTS uses email as an avenue through which to provide customer service and technical support. We
may contact the customer using Personal
Data in an attempt to resolve an issue. We may also use Personal Data to proactively notify customers of technical issues which may affect them, (legal basis: Article 6(1) b. GDPR).
Transactions: MTS processes Personal Data, including contact and billing information collected from individuals who wish to conduct a transaction, (e.g. via email order).
Information collected for transactions may include a payment card number and security code, although MTS does not store such data. MTS uses this Personal Data information to check purchasers’ qualifications and verify their identity, as well as for billing and shipping purposes, to provide the services and/or products the purchasers have requested, (legal basis: Article 6(1) b. GDPR).
Protection: MTS processes Personal Data to protect MTS’s rights and pursue available remedies, enforce MTS’s terms and conditions, prevent or investigate fraud, protect MTS’s operations and users, and for any other reasons MTS deems necessary to protect its business interests as is allowed by applicable law. MTS performs this processing
to pursue its legitimate interests in business continuity, (legal basis: Article 6(1) f. GDPR).
Ethics Matters: MTS processes Personal Data where applicable to respond to any reported ethics or compliance matters, (legal basis: Article 6(1) c. and/or f. GDPR).
Job opportunities: MTS processes Personal Data (e.g. Personal Data contained in the CV
or motivation letter) of job applicants where necessary for hiring decisions, (legal basis: Article 6(1) a. and/or b. GDPR).
MTS also collects other data ((legal basis: Article 6(1) f. GDPR) ) when you use its websites, in order to pursue our legitimate interests in business continuity and provide adequate services to website users:
MTS uses page view and navigation information to ensure that users can find information on our websites as quickly as possible. Also, MTS analyzes user traffic patterns throughout our websites.
MTS does not attempt to identify individual visitors to our websites through such analysis, but do collect data on general types of users based on domain name or browser type. This information is obtained directly from the user's web browser identification information, using cookies and similar types of passive tracking mechanisms.
MTS does not combine other data with Personal Data to identify individuals. MTS’ processing of Personal Data is performed based on MTS’ legitimate interest to conduct business
activities.
With which third parties do we share Personal Data?
MTS may rely on third party service providers in order to provide you with the products and/or services you request as well as to provide security and related operational support. Subject to applicable law, MTS may communicate your Personal Data to public authorities or courts where it is requested to do so or if such communications are required to protect and/or enforce MTS’s rights. MTS also may disclose your Personal Data in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of its business. MTS may also share your Personal Data with third party partners in connection with co-sponsored events and promotions, and as otherwise permitted by applicable laws.
International Transfers
Third Party data may be accessed from non-EU countries, and in particular from the United States, for the purposes defined above. In addition, MTS may rely on third party service providers for hosting, maintenance, and support purposes, which may involve data transfers out of the EU.
MTS is committed to providing protection for data transferred to and/or made accessible from non-EU countries, and MTS therefore enters into a European Model Contract as adopted by the
Commission Decision 2010/87/EU (“EMC”) for transfers of personal data to non-EU countries. MTS enters into EMCs with MTS entities located outside the EU as well as with third parties located outside the EU, unless other guarantees recognized as valid either by the EU’s General
Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or the European Commission are in place.
How long does MTS keep your Personal Data?
MTS may retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our contracts.

Site Security
MTS uses a variety of security measures, including encryption technology, to minimize the risk of the loss, misuse, or alteration of information provided to MTS. While MTS has measures in place to safeguard the Personal Data it processes, no security system is perfect, and MTS cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide.

You have the right to access your Personal Data. You can request that your Personal Data be rectified or deleted. You are also entitled to object to the processing of your Personal Data or to request restriction thereof.

When MTS receives a request from a data subject concerning the processing of their Personal Data, the DPO and Office of Risk and Compliance will evaluate whether MTS is required to
grant the data subject’s request and take any action as may be appropriate and in compliance with applicable law.
