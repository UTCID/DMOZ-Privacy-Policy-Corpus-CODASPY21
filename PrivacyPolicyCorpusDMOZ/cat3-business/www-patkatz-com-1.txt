Optimus Consulting has adopted this privacy policy in order to ensure users of our commitment and dedication to privacy. The following privacy guidelines apply to the websites, www.patkatz.com and www.pauseworks.com.
During a visit to our web sites, your privacy is respected. We do not collect personal information about you unless you choose to send us an e-mail, subscribe to the e-zine, or place an order, in which you voluntarily provide your name and contact information.
When you visit our sites, our servers automatically log some information such as: your Internet protocol address, Internet service provider, operating system, the site from which you arrived, the time and date of your visit, and pages requested. The servers identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in aggregate form and available to our Web staff for use in improving our Web site and ensuring that it provides the optimal Web experience for visitors.
Subscriptions to the Pause E-Zine require a confirming opt-in response to the initial request to safeguard against third party mischief.
Our sites use shopping cart technology that ensures your personal and payment information is kept confidential and secure.
When you provide us with any personal information including your name, address, e-mail and credit card number, it is processed over a secure connection on secure servers. We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to encrypt all information you provide before sending it to our servers. SSL is the industry standard and the best software available for secure ecommerce transactions.
The VeriSign Secure Site Seal assures you that the web site has been authenticated by VeriSign and that confidential transactions with the site are secured by SSL encryption.
