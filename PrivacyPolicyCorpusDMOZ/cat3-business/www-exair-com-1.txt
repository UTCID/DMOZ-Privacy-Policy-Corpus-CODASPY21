Air Amplifiers
Super Air Amplifier™ and Accessories
Super Air Amplifier™ and Accessories
Utilizing the Coanda effect, a basic principle of fluidics, Air Amplifiers become a simple, low cost way to circulate air, move smoke, fumes, and light materials. Using a small amount of compressed air as their power source, Super Air Amplifiers pull in large volumes of surrounding air to produce high volume, high velocity outlet flows through a fixed air gap. Quiet, efficient Air Amplifiers will create output flows up to 25 times their consumption rate. Both the vacuum and discharge ends of the Air Amplifier can be ducted, making them ideal for drawing fresh air from another location, or moving smoke and fumes away. Also effective to cool, clean and dry parts or processes.
