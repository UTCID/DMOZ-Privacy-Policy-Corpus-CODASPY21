If you are visiting the baggallini.com website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States.

Security
baggallini.com has imposed confidentiality obligations on its service providers who will have access to the personal information collected on this site. In addition, we have implemented administrative, technical and physical measures to address the confidentiality of personal information collected on this website. We use secure-socket-layer (SSL) certificate authentication to protect order information during transmission by encrypting all sensitive information transmitted during your shopping experience. SSL is encryption technology that provides security for information that's transmitted over the Internet. This site accepts orders only from web browsers that permit communication through SSL technology. We also reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.
While we implement the above security measures for this website, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
information we collect
Personal Information
We may collect and store personally identifiable information on certain areas of the baggallini.com website when users register, purchase products or services, request information or a response, sign up for sweepstakes or contests, or participate in user posting areas, such as bulletin boards, discussion forums, reviews and surveys, and social media platforms.
Such personally identifiable information may include but is not limited to your name, address, age, date of birth, sex, e-mail address, telephone numbers, information about your interests and activities and your reviews of our website or products that we sell. We may combine the personally identifiable information that we receive from you through the baggallini.com website with information from other sources included but not limited to social media platforms.
If you transact business with us, such personally identifiable information may also include financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). You may elect not to provide certain types of information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of the baggallini.com website.
We may also collect and store personally identifiable information about other people that you provide to us. If you use the baggallini.com website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product as a gift, information that may interest them or messages (such as invitations) through our system, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient.

We may in the future allow third-party advertising companies to use cookies when you visit baggallini.com. These selected companies may use information (not including your name, address, credit card information, email address, or telephone number) about your choice to visit our website and your visits to other websites to provide advertisements about our products on this and other websites. These selected companies also provide this information to us which we use to gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements they place about our products and for marketing purposes. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about no longer having information from these third-party cookies used by these companies or provided to us, click here.
