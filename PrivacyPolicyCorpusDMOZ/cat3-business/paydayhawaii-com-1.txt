USA PATRIOT ACT: As a result of the events on September 11, 2001, the USA PATRIOT ACT was signed into law. One section of the USA PATRIOT ACT requires financial institutions including Money Service Businesses to verify the identity of persons seeking to cash checks, transfer money or purchase money orders and to maintain records of information used to verify the person' s identity including name, address, social security number and other identifying information. PayDayHawaii is required to follow this law by obtaining valid picture identification and verifying other information given by our clients to make transactions. Checks cashed in excess of $1000 require full verification with the maker and issuing bank.
WE DO NOT DISCLOSE ANY NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO ANYONE, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY LAW.
NOTICE TO CONSUMERS: Consumer complaints about the check cashing business may be filed with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. The telephone number of the consumer information service of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs is 587-3222.
