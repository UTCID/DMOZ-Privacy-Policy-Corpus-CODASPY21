Avoiding Foreclosure
Kitsap Bank has been the community's financial partner for over 100 years. If you are a homeowner experiencing temporary or permanent financial difficulties, we're here to help. Please ask for our assistance, so that we can try to work together to find an agreeable solution for repayment of mortgages on your primary residence.

This option may be combined with forbearance.ForebearanceIf you have experienced a reduction in pay or an increase in living expenses, you may be able to reduce or suspend payments on the loan for your primary residence for a short period of time. At the end of the agreed upon time, you must show that you will be able to bring the loan current.Repayment PlanWith this option, you agree to resume making regular monthly payments in addition to a portion of the past due payments each month until you are caught up.RefinanceTo qualify for a refinance, your loan must be current. Ask your lender if you qualify for this option.Pre-foreclosure SaleYou may be able to sell your property and pay off your mortgage even though your property may not be in an equity position.
