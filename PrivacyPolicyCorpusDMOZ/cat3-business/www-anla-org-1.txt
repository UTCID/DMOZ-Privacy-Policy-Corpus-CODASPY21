ANLA
American Nursery & Landscape Association (ANLA)
Ensuring a Viable Future for The Horticulture Industry
For well over a century the American Nursery & Landscape Association, ANLA, ensured a viable future for the horticulture industry advocating the industry’s interests on issues including the availability of an economic workforce, efficient interstate shipping of plant material, and key tax protections for measuring inventory and the generational transfer of land and businesses.
The association’s objectives:
to promote the interests of its members in cultivating “personal acquaintance with others engaged in the trade,”
the exhibition of plants and equipment “used in the business,”
the exchange and sale of stock.
The following are resources available to the American nursery and landscape industry:
