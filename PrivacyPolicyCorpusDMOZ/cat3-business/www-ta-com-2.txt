At TA Associates’ or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions or the Site that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before J.A.M.S. or its successor. TA Associates shall advance the costs of such binding arbitration, but you agree that should TA Associates prevail in the arbitration, TA Associates is entitled to reimbursement of all costs. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in Boston, MA, before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by J.A.M.S. and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by J.A.M.S. unless specifically modified in these Terms and Conditions. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator will have the power to order the production of documents by each party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take up to three (3) depositions as of right, and the arbitrator will not have the power to order the answering of interrogatories or the responses to requests for admission or the inspection of premises. In connection with any arbitration, each party must provide to the other, no later than ten (10) business days before the date of the arbitration, the identity of all persons that may testify at the arbitration, a copy of all documents that may be introduced at the arbitration or considered or used by a party’s witness or expert, and a summary of the expert’s opinions and the basis for said opinions. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory damages set forth in the Terms and Conditions and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under these Terms and Conditions and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The parties covenant and agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF EITHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION.
