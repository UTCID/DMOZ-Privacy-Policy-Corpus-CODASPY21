The purpose of a cookie is to store a small amount of information regarding a specific visitor and website.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your PII to outside parties.

We may also release information when appropriate in order to comply with the law, enforce our privacy policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.

Which data protection law do we follow?
On May 25, 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect. This law impacts EU-based organizations and requires any person or company in Germany (and conceivably the world) that operates a website collecting PII from visitors to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website. This privacy policy must state which information is being collected and notify those individuals or companies with whom their information is being shared.
How does our website handle ‘Do Not Track’ signals?
Do Not Track policy and technology allow visitors to opt out of being tracked by websites. This includes analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms. ‘Do Not Track’ provides visitors with a single, simple persistent choice to opt out of third-party website and/or web tracking.
We honor ‘Do Not Track’ signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.
Does our website allow third-party behavioral tracking?
Yes, for optimum evaluation of our website’s activities, we allow third-party behavioral tracking. The sole purpose of this tracking is to allow us to count and monitor clicks on downloads and external links, and also to identify the country within which the click was made. This allows us to better understand our audience and work to improve our user’s website experience.
Behavioral tracking typically allows websites to customize internet content to specific users based on the collection and interpretation of market research data, browsing patterns through the use of cookies, social media, and other technologies. It is also important to note that most behavioral tracking is done without a user’s knowledge.
