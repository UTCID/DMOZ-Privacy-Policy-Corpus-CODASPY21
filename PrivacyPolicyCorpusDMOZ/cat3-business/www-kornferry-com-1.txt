TALK TO AN EXPERT
The role of the general counsel and chief compliance officer has been dramatically redefined. As companies grow and expand, the complexity of the legal function increases exponentially. Risk management, global regulations across industries, and the complexity of managing intellectual property in a technology-enabled world are just a few of the pressures and responsibilities faced by today’s legal executives. Organizations require proven experts who think strategically and act proactively to protect the organization and respond to opportunities. In addition, legal executives must assume the role of “company conscience,” leveraging the law to full advantage without sacrificing corporate ethics and integrity.
