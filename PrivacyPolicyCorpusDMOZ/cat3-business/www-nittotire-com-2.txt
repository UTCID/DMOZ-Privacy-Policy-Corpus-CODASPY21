Information for California Residents
The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") provides certain California consumers with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of Personal Information, as well as rights to access and control Personal Information. Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (because it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a federal privacy law, such as the GrammLeachBliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below in our California Privacy Notice.

Right to Request Deletion of Information
Certain consumers have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete any Personal Information that we have collected directly from you.

If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.
