We do not knowingly gather or solicit data from children under thirteen (13) years of age through this Site for marketing purposes. By using this Site you represent that you are not under thirteen (13) years of age.Top of PageDispute ResolutionApplicable Law; Time to Bring ClaimsThe Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Iowa, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use, the Online Privacy Statement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the Company with respect to these Terms of Use, the Online Privacy Statement or your use of or access to the Site or Content (“Dispute”). YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURTS, ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL BE RESOLVED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION . If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or breaches of security and your misuse of the Site or Content.Exclusive Venue for LitigationTo the extent that the arbitration provisions provided for herein do not apply, the proper forum for any Dispute shall be in the courts of the State of Iowa for Linn County or the United States District Court, Northern District of Iowa (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). You expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court for Linn County, Iowa for any litigation other than small claims court actions. Further you hereby waive any right to a jury trial.Agreement to Binding ArbitrationAll Disputes shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with its Expedited Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority, except as may otherwise be stated in these Terms of Use, to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use or Online Privacy Statement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use or Online Privacy Statement is void or voidable (except for the class action waiver below). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable in court. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and will include a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. You and the Company (the “parties”) adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of these Terms of Use) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or Online Privacy Statement. Either party may request a panel of three (3) arbitrators in lieu of only one (1) arbitrator. The parties will make reasonable efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator chosen from the JAMS panel and the arbitrator(s) must be neutral. The arbitration shall take place at a JAMS location closest to where you reside. The parties agree that all proceedings before the arbitrators will remain confidential between the parties. However, either party may register the judgment of any arbitral award in an appropriate court, and the parties may disclose information regarding the arbitration if required by law or judicial decision. This agreement to binding arbitration in no way limits or affects your or our rights under the Investment Advisers Act. Nothing in these Terms of Use precludes you or us from filing or participating in administrative proceedings before government administrative agencies to address alleged violations of law enforced by those state agencies.JAMS’ RULES GOVERNING THE ARBITRATION MAY BE ACCESSED AT WWW.JAMSADR.COM OR BY CALLING JAMS AT 1-800-352-5267. IF YOU INITIATE AN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE COMPANY, $250 IS THE ONLY ARBITRATION FEE YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EQUIVALENT TO CURRENT COURT FILING FEES. ALL OTHER JAMS ARBITRATION COSTS WILL BE BORNE BY THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ANY REMAINING JAMS CASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND ALL PROFESSIONAL FEES FOR THE ARBITRATOR’S SERVICES. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION. THE PARTIES ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ALTHOUGH ARBITRATION ALLOWS FOR THE DISCOVERY OR EXCHANGE OF NON-PRIVILEGED INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE DISPUTE, THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.Class Action and Class Arbitration WaiverYou and the Company each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in its individual capacities only and not as a purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”), and you expressly waive any right to file a Class Action in any forum. The arbitrator(s) is empowered to award full relief to an individual claimant, but any relief awarded cannot extend beyond that individual claimant. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any court or arbitrator(s) determines that the Class Action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason (including any alleged incompatibility with the Investment Advisors Act or other federal securities laws or regulations), or that an arbitration can proceed as a Class Action, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, THEY UNDERSTAND AND CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY, THROUGH ARBITRATION.Exception - Small Claims Court ClaimsNotwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for Disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.30 Day Right to Opt OutYou have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions and class action waiver set forth in this section by notifying us in writing at Transamerica, Attn: Corporate Law, 4333 Edgewood Rd NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52499 or email us at investigations@transamerica.com within thirty (30) days of your registration on or use of the Site.

Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of this arbitration provision. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, then the Company also will not be bound by them.Top of PageMiscellaneous
