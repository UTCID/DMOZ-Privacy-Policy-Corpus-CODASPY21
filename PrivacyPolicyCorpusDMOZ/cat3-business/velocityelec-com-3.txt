THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCLUSIVELY GOVERN ALL SALES OF PRODUCTS ("PRODUCTS") AND THE PROVISION OF SERVICES ("SERVICES") BY THE VELOCITY ELECTRONICS ENTITY IDENTIFIED IN THE APPLICABLE INVOICE, QUOTE, SALE CONFIRMATION OR OTHER SALE DOCUMENT (THE "SALE DOCUMENT"), WHICH SHALL BE EITHER VELOCITY ELECTRONICS CORP., VELOCITY ELECTRONICS B.V., OR VELOCITY ELECTRONICS ASIA PTE LTD. (SUCH VELOCITY ENTITY, THE "SELLER"). THE APPLICABLE SALE DOCUMENT SHALL BE PROVIDED BY SELLER TO BUYER AND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ANY CONFLICTING, CONTRARY OR ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANY PURCHASE ORDER, DOCUMENT OR OTHER COMMUNICATION ("PURCHASE ORDER") FROM BUYER.
BY ACCEPTING DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCTS OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THE APPLICABLE SALE DOCUMENT, BUYER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITHOUT MODIFICATION BY ANY PRIOR OR LATER COMMUNICATION FROM BUYER. SELLER'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A PURCHASE ORDER OR SELLER'S FAILURE TO OBJECT TO ANY CONFLICTING, CONTRARY OR ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN A PURCHASE ORDER SHALL NOT BE DEEMED AN ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR A WAIVER OF OBJECTION THERETO.
1. PRICES; TERMS OF PAYMENT: Prices and payment terms for Products or Services are as set forth in the Sale Document. Prices are exclusive of, and Buyer shall pay, all taxes, duty, freight charges and all other similar fees, such as forwarding agent's and broker's fees, consular fees, document fees and import duties. Buyer agrees to pay these taxes unless Buyer has provided Seller with an exemption resale certificate in the appropriate form for the jurisdiction of Buyer's place of business and any jurisdiction to which Products are to be directly shipped or where Services are to be performed hereunder, or unless the sale is otherwise exempt from these taxes. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless for any liability for tax in connection with the sale, as well as the collection or withholding thereof, including penalties and interest thereon. All payments shall be made by cash on delivery, company check, credit card, or by wire transfer to an account which will be designated by Seller in accordance with the terms specified in the Sale Document, without abatement, set-off, or deduction of any amount whatsoever and despite any defense or counterclaim Buyer may have against Seller. A late charge of 1.5% per month (or the maximum rate allowed by law if less) will be assessed on all outstanding amounts not paid within the terms specified in the Sale Document. Buyer shall be liable for costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, in any action to collect past due amounts.
Seller reserves the right to establish and/or change credit and payment terms extended to Buyer when, in Seller's sole opinion, Buyer's financial condition or previous payment record warrants such action. Further, on delinquent accounts, Seller shall not be obligated to continue performance under any agreement with Buyer. If Seller believes in good faith that Buyer's ability to make payments may be impaired or if Buyer shall fail to pay any invoice when due, Seller may suspend delivery of any order or any remaining balance thereof until such payment is made or cancel any order or any remaining balance thereof, and Buyer shall remain liable to pay for any Products already shipped.
2. DELIVERY; RISK OF LOSS; TITLE: All shipments of Products shall be Ex Works (as defined in Incoterms 2000) Seller's facility in Austin, Texas USA, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands or Singapore, as applicable, unless otherwise specified in the Sale Document. Title and risk of loss and damage shall pass to Buyer upon delivery of Products to a carrier at Seller's facility. Delivery dates quoted by Seller are estimates only and are subject to various delays, whether in the control or beyond the control of Seller. Buyer acknowledges that any delay in delivery shall not give rise to any liability on the part of Seller whatsoever, including for loss of use or INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Transportation and insurance shall be at Buyer's sole risk and expense, and any claim for loss or damage in transit shall be against the carrier only. In the absence of specific shipping instructions from Buyer, Seller will select the carrier and method of shipment.
3. SECURITY INTEREST: Seller retains a purchase money security interest in the Products delivered to Buyer, and in their accessories, replacements, accessions, proceeds and Products, including accounts receivable (collectively, the "Collateral") to secure payment of all amounts due under the applicable Sale Document.

Any repossession or removal shall be without prejudice to any other remedy of Seller hereunder, at law or in equity. Buyer agrees, from time to time, to take any act and execute and deliver any document (including, without limitation, financing statements) reasonably requested by Seller to create, perfect, preserve, protect and enforce this security interest.
4. ACCEPTANCE/RETURNS: Shipments will be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer upon delivery to Buyer unless rejected upon receipt.
