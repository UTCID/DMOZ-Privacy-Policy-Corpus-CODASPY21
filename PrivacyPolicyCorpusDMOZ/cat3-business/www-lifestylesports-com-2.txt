CONDITIONS OF MAKING AN ONLINE PURCHASE
BUYING ONLINE
You may purchase certain goods online at lifestylesports.com. Please see our delivery and returns information for details of delivery charges and restrictions. The delivery times given are estimated and from time to time may be affected by events outside our control, for example inclement weather or postal strikes, for which we will not be responsible.
We offer Free Standard Delivery on all orders within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. We reserve the right to withdraw the offer at any time and standard restrictions apply.
In order to make a purchase you will need to set up an account. We will ask for personal information in order to set up the account and you agree to provide accurate, current, complete and non misleading information. Our Privacy Policy outlines how this information will be collected and managed.
By placing an order online you make an offer to purchase in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. We will acknowledge receipt of your order both online and via an email order confirmation but this does not constitute our acceptance of your offer to purchase. Your offer has been accepted only when we have confirmed that the order has been dispatched and payment has been made. You will be responsible for all applicable taxes, duties or other charges that may be applied by LSS or otherwise to your order.
LSS reserves the right to refuse any order for any reason. Orders may be delayed or cancelled where LSS is not given completely accurate information and/or is unable to contact the person who placed the order or cardholder responsible for payment of same.
Once we accept your order it cannot be amended. Therefore please ensure it is accurate when you confirm the order.
Once you’ve placed an order on the website, we will send you an email to acknowledge your order. This acknowledgement does not imply an acceptance of the order. For orders paid via credit or debit cards, only when the order has been despatched will the purchase contract be made and will you be charged for the goods ordered. Once the items have been shipped you will receive an email informing you of the shipment. If you have paid through a PayPal account, your account will be charged when the order is placed.
You can return items within 28 days of receipt. Please see our Delivery and Returns Policy for exclusions, conditions and method of return.
PRESENTATION, PRICING AND AVAILABILITY OF GOODS
We always aim to ensure that all details, sizes, colours, descriptions and prices appearing on this website are accurate, but from time to time errors may occur. While we try to accurately represent the colour of an item in our photographic representation of the item may be affected by the settings of the computer on which it is viewed or for other technical reasons.
Where we have made an error in a promotion or the price of an item on our site, we reserve the right to withdraw the promotion or item from sale at the incorrect price and present it at the correct price. If you have placed an order at the incorrect price, we will inform you of the error and if possible, give you the opportunity to confirm your order at the correct price before cancelling the order.
Prices and promotions are subject to change without notice.
All items sold are subject to availability and while every effort is made to fulfil your order, products turn over very quickly in our warehouse and on rare occasions the item you require may not be available although you have received a confirmation of your order. We will advise you by email if we have to cancel your order for this reason, and no payment will be taken.
PAYMENT
All prices are inclusive of VAT at the rate applicable to the country to which the product is being shipped. Delivery costs are charged in addition to the product price and included in the total cost in accordance with our charges as detailed in our Delivery and Returns information. Any additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in the total cost when you check out.
If you are paying by credit or debit card, we will carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your card upon receiving your order to ensure there are sufficient funds to settle the transaction. Goods will not be despatched until the pre-authorisation check is complete and authorisation has been provided by the card issuer. Life Style Sports is not responsible for any failure of the card issuer to provide authorisation and will not ship your order until authorisation has been received by Life Style Sports. By placing an order you confirm you are the authorised card holder.
We will charge your card when your order is confirmed.
If you order goods from the website for delivery in another jurisdiction other than the Republic of Ireland, or order goods using a non Euro denominated credit or debit card, the actual price you will be charged will be subject to the exchange rate applied by your credit or debit card company.
Life Style Sports aims to provide you with a safe, reliable shopping experience. We therefore support Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode, which have the same principles as Chip & Pin, and which help to protect your card against unauthorized use. If your bank or card issuer has adopted this programme, you may receive a Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode verification page when you are shopping on the website. If you are not presented with the page but wish to register for the programme to improve the security associated with your card, please contact your bank directly, or search for Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode on the Internet for more information. If you are prompted with a Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode screen, and you choose not to register, your card issuer may not allow your order to be processed on that card. If this occurs, you will be asked to provide a different payment method to complete your purchase.
If you have paid via your PayPal account, your account will be charged at the time of the order, once you confirm your order on the website. If we are unable to ship your items to you for some reason, we will refund the value of the items that were not sent. This refund will be made to the payment method that you used for the order.
During the checkout process, we may use the information you provided to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. In so doing, we may disclose your address and postcode, as well as other information about your order, to third parties to perform that validation. Any disclosure of your information is done securely and you will never receive any marketing solicitation as a result of the information provided.
We take reasonable care to safeguard against unauthorised parties accessing your order information. However, we shall not be held liable for any loss caused by a third party accessing the data you’ve provided while using the website. We shall not be held liable to any person for any loss caused by the use of any of the information contained in or displayed on the LSS website. For additional information please see our Privacy Policy.

A gift card can be used for the purchase of merchandise only. A gift card cannot be returned or exchanged for cash. Purchases made with the card will be deducted until the balance reaches zero. No change will be given so the remaining balance will stay on the card and can be spent on future purchases. If the purchase price exceeds the amount available to spend on the card, the remaining balance can be settled via another accepted payment method. No more than five gift cards can be used in one transaction.
The gift cards have an open value. This means that the card value remains open as amounts are spent and further amounts can be added to it at any time up to a maximum value of €250.
Gift Cards are valid for a limited time only. The card will expire if it has not been used for 12 consecutive months and any remaining balance will be deleted. Once deleted a card will not be replaced. Please note that checking a balance in store constitutes use of the card and it is not necessary to make a purchase.
The cost of anything you buy with the card and return to store in accordance with the Life Style Sports Returns Policy will be refunded to the gift card. This does not affect your statutory rights.
The holder of the card is responsible for its security and lost or stolen cards will not be replaced.
If you are purchasing the gift card online, please pay particular attention to the delivery address you enter as we cannot be responsible if the address is incorrect and the card is used to someone other than your intended recipient.
The card can be used against purchases in the original currency only, so a card purchased in sterling cannot make purchases in euro, and vice versa.
