Shipping times
In normal circumstances, all the couriers we use deliver when expected, however, please note that we can not guarantee delivery times, only to dispatch on time with the chosen delivery method.The closest to guaranteeing a delivery time is with a dedicated door to door service which is charged by the mile. Any delivery method may be subject to weather, traffic, and other unforeseen circumstances.
If you order is for a very urgent, or time sensitive event for example, we would always reccomend a dedicated delivery. When you check out you will be presented with a range of delivery options - depending on the size of the items you have ordered.The following shipping times are in addition to the dispatch times quoted above.
Standard Courier - Normally TNT - Next working day.
Standard Courier Large - Parcelforce - 2 working days.
Pallet delivery - Next working day.
Door to door delivery - Priced by the mile - please call for more info.
Please note that pallet deliverys are "Kerb-side" which means that the driver is not obliged to bring the palelt into the building. They will normally bring it in if you have a large roller door for example, but they will not unpack a pallet and carry it in, and certainly not upstairs.
Returns
We must be contacted prior to the return of any goods regardless of circumstances If a product is defective we need to know within 3 days of receipt. We will replace any items that were delivered damaged free of charge.
We are TRADE ONLY - Our products are made to order, so we can not accept any returns unless the items are faulty, or not as described.

If you need to cancel an order, please phone the studio ASAP. If you have ordered out of normal working hours, please email the studio straight away. A cancelation charge may apply.

we are unable to cancel it and offer a full refund. Depending on how much work had be done to your job, we may be able to offer a part refund.

Coronavirus
We are currently working hard to produce all orders ahead of schedule where possible.
We have good stocks ( which were built up in preparation for a no-deal Brexit ) and are as prepared as we can be
for what comes. However - there may well be situations in the coming weeks that are out of our control: for example restrictions moving around the UK, Couriers not operating, not being able to work under government advice etc...
If we are unable to deliver ( or complete a job ) in these circumstances, we can either deliver the job at a later date, or cancel the job - charging for the percentage of work complete,the materials used ,
and refunding the balance.
By placing an order at this time, you are accepting that we cannot be held in any way responsible for non-delivery as a result of any restrictions resulting from coronavirus.
