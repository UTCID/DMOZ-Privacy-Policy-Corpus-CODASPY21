To the Mooney Community:
Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving!
The new website is almost complete and we’re hoping it will go live sometime next week. Please stay tuned! In the meantime, backspring kits are in and out to your service centers and more will be on their way for those of you who have been waiting. Also, coming soon: We’ll be opening our Service Center beginning in January. If you plan to be near Kerrville and need work done, please reach out to our Service Center Concierge, Paulina Esquino at the following email address: pesquino@mooney.com Use the Subject Line: “Service Center” and she’ll get right back to you. More details to come! Keep flying and be safe!
