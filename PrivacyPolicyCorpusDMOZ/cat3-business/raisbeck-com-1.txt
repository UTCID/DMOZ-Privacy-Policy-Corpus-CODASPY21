REMEMBERING LYNN THOMAS
We are all saddened by the passing of our leader and friend, Lynn Thomas, who recently lost his battle with cancer.
A life-long aviation enthusiast, Lynn pursued his passion for aviation both professionally and personally, making his first solo flight at the age of 16. Over the years, he continued to fly as often as possible, both for business and pleasure
Lynn joined Raisbeck Engineering in 2017, bringing his unique talent to the company where his drive and leadership contributed greatly to Raisbeck’s continued success. His experience and achievements in the general aviation industry included sales, business management and marketing with both aviation manufacturers and dealers. Lynn started his career working with major investment firms, including Everen Securities and Paine Weber.
Lynn took an active interest in all facets of the companies he represented. He was often spotted on the shop floor at Quest Aircraft or roaming the halls and main lobby at Banyan. Here at Raisbeck, Lynn always took the opportunity to spend time with the Raisbeck team to support their efforts.
In addition to Lynn’s passion for aviation, he was an avid outdoorsman.  Whether fly fishing or paddling his hand-built canoe, he loved taking in the beauty found in nature.
He leaves us with a sense of great loss.  Lynn has left an indelible mark on all of our lives and will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
