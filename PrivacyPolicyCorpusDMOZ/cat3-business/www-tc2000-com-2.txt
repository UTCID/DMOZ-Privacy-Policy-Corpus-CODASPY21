We may also aggregate Collected Information in order to conduct research, analysis or studies for our own business purposes, such as improving our services, security, content, navigation and functionality, or to personalize your experience (for example, to customize your screen layout).
We share Collected Information with others not affiliated with TC2000 Brokerage only in the following situations:

Any third party with whom we share Collected Information is required either contractually or by law to keep it strictly confidential.
Law Enforcement and Legal Processes.
We may share Collected Information with the government and regulatory agencies, as well as law enforcement officials, in order to comply with a lawful summons, court order, subpoena, discovery request, fraud investigation, audit, regulatory examination or other valid court, government, or regulatory agency request or obligation (for example, to report suspicious transactions).
Business Transitions.
In the event TC2000 Brokerage or any of its assets are acquired, we may share Collected Information with the acquiring company.
How We Store and Protect Collected Information
TC2000 Brokerage is absolutely committed to maintaining the security and privacy of your account and personal information.
We use advanced physical, electronic and procedural measures, and we constantly adapt, upgrade and improve these measures as requirement and technology change.
Among other things, we store and protect the Collected Information by:
Electronic Safeguards.
TC2000 Brokerage uses electronic safeguards like firewalls to maintain the confidentiality of Collected Information, and our secure website areas uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology for all transactions.
Personally identifiable Collected Information you submit through our website is encrypted and secure.
Usernames and Passwords.
TC2000 Brokerage uses password encryption technology and dual-level authentication to secure your usernames and passwords, and protect your account against unauthorized access and control.
TradFire customers also have the option to use a security token key card to enhance security over account information and access.
Other Physical and Procedural Safeguards.
TC2000 Brokerage goes to great lengths to prevent Collected Information from being compromised.
For example, all TC2000 Brokerage regularly trains and educates its employees about security and privacy practices.
We also require all third-party service providers who need access to Collected Information to sign written agreements obligating them to maintain the confidentiality of Collected Information.
We also carefully restrict access to Collected Information to only those employees or service providers who need access to the information.
We regularly review all of our safeguards and make adjustments or improvements in response to advances in technology and the latest security threats or trends.
SIPC Account Protection.
TC2000 Brokerage customers’ securities accounts are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") for a maximum coverage of $500,000 (with a cash sublimit of $250,000).
SIPC is a non-profit, membership corporation funded by broker-dealers that are members of SIPC (such as TC2000 Brokerage).
More information about SIPC can be found at www.SIPC.org, or at www.finra.org/InvestorInformation/InvestorProtection/
SIPCProtection/index.htm.
Excess SIPC Policy.
Our clearing firm has obtained an excess insurance policy with certain underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, for up to an additional $30 million (with a cash sublimit of $900,000), subject to an aggregate limit of $150 million.
Please note that futures and options on futures are not covered, and—as with all securities firms—this coverage provides protection against failure of a broker-dealer, not against loss of market value of securities.
