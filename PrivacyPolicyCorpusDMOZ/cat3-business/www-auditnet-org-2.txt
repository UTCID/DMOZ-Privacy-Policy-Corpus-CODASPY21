THE SERVICES, THE MATERIALS, AND THE SITE ARE MADE AVAILABLE ON AN AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE BASIS, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY SORT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR DUTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, PERFORMANCE OR FREEDOM FROM ERRORS OR UNINTERRUPTED USE.

WE DO NOT AND CANNOT CONTROL THE FLOW OF DATA TO OR FROM OUR NETWORKS AND OTHER PORTIONS OF THE INTERNET. SUCH FLOW DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERNET SERVICES PROVIDED OR CONTROLLED BY THIRD PARTIES. AT TIMES, ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES CAN IMPAIR OR DISRUPT YOUR CONNECTIONS TO THE INTERNET (OR PORTIONS THEREOF). ALTHOUGH WE WILL USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO TAKE ALL ACTIONS WE DEEM APPROPRIATE TO REMEDY AND AVOID SUCH EVENTS, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH EVENTS WILL NOT OCCUR.

YOU AGREE THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SITE, SERVICES AND MATERIALS SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A RENDERING OF ANY TAX, LEGAL, ATTEST, ACCOUNTING, AUDITING OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR ADVICE.
In no event shall we be liable in an amount that exceeds the subscription fees that you have paid to Us during the calendar year in which the first claim alleging liability hereunder occurred. Further, We shall not be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damage, loss, or expense, including damage, loss or expense for lost profits, business interruption or lost revenue or business opportunity, related to the Services, the Site, or this Agreement, even if We have been advised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages. These limitations shall apply in full regardless of the theory of relief asserted (including all forms of negligence) and regardless of any assertion that a remedy has failed of its essential purpose.
You understand and agree that the provisions of this Section 9 are for the benefit of AuditNet® and its Grantors, and their respective directors, officers, partners, representatives, employees and agents.
