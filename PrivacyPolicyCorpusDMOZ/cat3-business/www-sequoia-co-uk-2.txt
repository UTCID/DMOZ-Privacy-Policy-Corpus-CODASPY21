Cellular Signal Analysers The SNYPER family of signal analysers are sophisticated yet easy to use with a large and bright, full colour display. The range covers 2G / 3G and LTE cellular technologies to discover all network cell towers in use today. The SNYPER is a hand held, battery operated unit and can operate for several hours between charges (depending on use). It analyses all cellular signals from any network at any particular site being surveyed. Technology Coverage – Global 3G / UMTS with 2G / GSM Fallback – European LTE Cat 4, LTE Cat 1,  3G / UMTS and 2G / GSM – North American LTE Cat 4, LTE Cat 1 and 3G / UMTS – Global LTE Cat M and LTE Cat NBIoT Common Applications – SIM free network survey for all cellular networks – Supports 2G / GPRS, 3G / UMTS and 4G / LTE – Summary feature displaying all available networks and cells simultaneously – Handheld ergonomic unit with long life rechargeable battery – Large, bright full colour LCD screen for ultra clear display – Supplied with ‘hard’ carrying case including PSU – Perform site survey to determine highest signal strength – Real time liveSCAN feature to determine basestation position

Diverse Antenna Solutions Antennas are a fundamental component of any wireless RF solution. Both, the most complex and the simplest wireless RF applications rely on antennas for end to end communication. The quality and performance of the antenna is critical to the correct operation of any wireless system, and it pays to specify it wisely. Technology Coverage – Global Cellular Bands (2G / 3G / 4G / LTE / Cat M / NB IoT / 5G) – WiFi / BLE (2.4GHz / 5.8GHz) / Sigfox / LoRa / ZigBee – GNSS Positioning (GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou) – Global ISM Bands (151MHz / 173MHz / 433MHz / 458MHz / 868MHz / 915MHz / 2450MHz) Common Applications – Enhanced Cellular Performance – WiFi Linked Drones – Solar Farm: ‘Panel Data Collection’ – Smart Energy Meters – Sensor Monitoring and Data Collection – Combined Antenna Technologies
Antenna Solutions
RF Cable Solutions Siretta coax pigtail assemblies are made from high quality components and assembly methods to control VSWR and Return Loss. Two cable types are available, the smaller and more flexible 1.13mm and standard RG174. Patch cables are typically used for machine to machine interconnections and the low loss cable type is suitable for good signal strength links. Extension Cables are made from high quality components to ensure signal loss is reduced to a minimum. Technology Coverage – Assemblies supporting technologies from 100MHz up to 6GHz – 1.13mm – RG174 / RG174 Low Loss – RG58 / RG58 Low Loss Common Applications – Enhanced Cellular Performance – Improved RF Link Budget – Low Loss Cable for Long Cable Runs – Improved Options for Device Placement – Reduced Energy Usage – Multiple Connection Options
RF Cable Solutions
RF Adapter Solutions Siretta RF Adaptors are used to connect different configurations of cable termination together and to offer the ability to swap out or change the length of an RF link. Siretta stock a large range of adaptors for most of the common industry standard configurations used in the industrial environment. To improve network signal quality for antennas, they can be positioned separately to the connected device using a magnetic base. Surge protectors are used in industry to protect connected devices from destruction from lightening strikes when antennas are used externally. Technology Coverage – Adaptors supporting technologies from 100MHz up to 6GHz – SMA Male / SMA Female / SMA Reverse Polarity – TNC Male / FME Male / FME Female – MMCX Female / MCX Female Common Applications – Attach Devices to Existing Infrastructure – Improved RF Link Connections – Introduce Low Loss Cable for Extended Cable Runs – Improved Options for Device Placement – Improved Signal Performance – Lightening Strike Device Protection
