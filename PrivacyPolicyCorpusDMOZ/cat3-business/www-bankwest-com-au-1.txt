Bankwest Privacy Policy
Printable Privacy Policy (PDF)
Bankwest provides a wide range of banking and financial services. This policy describes how your personal information is handled by us.
Bankwest is a division of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) which has subsidiaries (the Group) that provide banking, finance, insurance, funds management, financial planning and advice, superannuation, stockbroking and other services. The Group includes Bankwest, CBA, CommSec, CommInsure, Commonwealth Financial Planning and Colonial First State businesses.
Australian members of our Group are bound by the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). CBA has a separate but consistent privacy policy which can be viewed at commbank.com.au.
For more information about the Group, including a complete list of Group members, see the CBA’s latest Annual Report, available at commbank.com.au/shareholders.
In addition to the Privacy Act, individuals located in the European Union (EU) may also have rights under EU based rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The GDPR has harmonised the data privacy laws of each individual EU country, giving more rights to individuals located in the EU and more obligations to organisations holding their personal information.
Details of additional rights of individuals located in the EU and how we meet them are outlined in Appendix 1 of the Bankwest Privacy Policy (PDF).
We take privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring the protection of your personal information, no matter where you are located.
We protect your information, and aim to be clear and open about what we do with it. You can find more information in places like our application forms and terms and conditions.
We understand your privacy is important to you, and we value your trust. That’s why we protect your information and aim to be clear about what we do with it.
This Policy explains how we handle your personal information. It also includes:
Our policy on the handling of credit reports and other credit information
Key information about credit reporting matters.

Using data to give you better customer service
We’re always working to improve our products and services and give you the best customer experience.
New technologies let Group members combine information we have about you and our other customers, for example transaction information, with data from other sources, such as third party websites or the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Our Group members analyse this data to learn more about you and other customers, and how to improve our products and services.
The Group members use this combined data to help other businesses better understand their customers. When we do, we don’t pass on any personal information about you.
We may share your information with other members of the CommBank Group. We may also share your information with others for the reasons mentioned in Section 4.

European Union (EU) based General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) legislation has replaced individual country data privacy laws in the EU, giving more rights to EU citizens (who are resident in the EU) as individuals and more obligations to organisations holding their personal information. Personal Information is defined as “any information relating to an identified of identifiable natural person”.
One of the rights is a right to be informed. GDPR requires us to provide more information about how we collect, use, share and store your personal information and your rights as a data subject.
If you are an EU resident and have an enquiry relating to your rights under the GDPR, complete our online feedback form.
These rights are additional to the Group Privacy Policy.
Special Information
The EU GDPR protects your special information. Special information is information about your religion, ethnicity, health or biometrics (for example, your fingerprints). We will only process this type of information, with your consent or where otherwise lawfully permitted.
How long we keep your personal information
We will keep your information for as long as you are a customer of the CBA Group. We aim to keep your information for only as long as we need it. We generally keep your information for up to 7 years after you stop being a customer, but we may keep your information for longer for the purpose of:
fulfilling legal or regulatory obligations
internal research and analytics
responding to a question or complaint or
being unable to delete the data for technical reasons.
How we use your information
We can only collect and use your personal information if we have a valid lawful reason to do so. For the Group, these reasons are:
Contract: We need to process your information in order to fulfil a contract you have with us, or because you have asked us to take specific steps before entering into a contract
Legal obligations: We need to process your information for us to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations)
Consent: You have given clear consent for us to process your personal information for a specific purpose
Legitimate interests: We need to process your information for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party. This legitimate interest is overridden where there is a good reason to protect your personal information.
We may use your information to:
confirm your identity
assess your application for a product or service
design, manage, price and provide our products and services
manage our relationship with you
minimise risks and identify or investigate fraud and other illegal activities
contact you, for example, when we need to tell you something important

manage our business
direct marketing.
To find out more about how we use your information, our reasoning and legitimate interests, see Appendix 1 of our Bankwest Privacy Policy (PDF).
The right to be informed how personal information is processed
You have the right to be informed how your personal information is being collected and used. If we require your consent to process your information you can withdraw consent at any time. If you withdraw consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. The right to withdraw only applies when the lawful basis of processing is consent.
The right of access to personal information
If you are an EU resident and have an enquiry relating to your rights under the GDPR, complete our online feedback form.
The right to rectification
You have the right to question any information we have about you that is inaccurate or incomplete. If you do, we will take reasonable steps to check the accuracy and correct it.
The right to erasure
You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information if there is no need for us to keep it. The right to erasure is also known as the right to be forgotten. You can make the request verbally or in writing. There may be legal or other reasons why we need to keep your data and if so we will tell you what these are.
The right to restrict processing
You have the right to ask us to restrict our use of your personal information in some circumstances. We may be able to restrict the use of your data. In this situation we would not use or share your information while it is restricted. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances.
The right to data portability
In some circumstances you have the right to request we provide you with a copy of the personal information you have provided to us in a format that can be easily reused.
The right to object
In some circumstances you have the right to object to us processing your personal information. In this case we can continue to hold your data but cannot use it.
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
You have rights over automated decisions. You can ask that we do not make our decision based on the automated decisioning alone. You can object to an automated decision and ask that a person reviews it.
The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
You have the right to complain to the regulator if you are not happy with the outcome of a complaint.
See the ‘Regulator Contact Details’ section for more information. The individual regulator websites will tell you how to report a concern.
Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
You may decline to share certain personal information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service.
We will seek parent or guardian consent to collect the personal information of children under 16.
