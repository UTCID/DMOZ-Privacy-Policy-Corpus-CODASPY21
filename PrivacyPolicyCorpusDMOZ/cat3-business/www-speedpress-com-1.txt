Safety Notice
Before beginning any project, review the instructions carefully, and if any doubts or questions remain, consult local professionals or authorities. Because local codes and regulations vary greatly, you should always check with local authorities to ensure that your project complies with all applicable codes and regulations. Always read and observe all of the safety precautions provided by any tool or equipment manufacturer, and follow all accepted safety procedures. What follows are reminders, although not an exhaustive list, of safety measures you should be aware of if undertaking home improvements yourself. They are not substitutes for your own caution, care, good judgment and common sense.
General Precautions:
Always read container labels on paints, solvents, and other products; provide ventilation, and observe all other warnings.
Always read the manufacturer's users manual for using a tool, especially the warnings. You should not use tools until the owner's manual is received and reviewed thoroughly.
Always pay deliberate attention to how a tool works so that you can avoid being injured. Do not try to force them to do what they were not designed to do.
Always keep your hands away from the business ends of blades, cutters, and bits.
Never work with any tools when you are tired or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Never cut tiny pieces of wood or pipe using a power saw. Cut small pieces off larger pieces.
Never work in insufficient lighting.
Never work with dull tools. Have them sharpened, or learn how to sharpen them yourself.
Never saw a surface that spans a large distance between horses without close support on each side of the cut; the piece can bend, closing on and jamming the blade, causing saw kickback.
Never support a surface from underneath with your leg or other part of your body when working.
Always use hold-downs and push sticks whenever possible when working on a table saw. Avoid working short pieces if you can.
Always make sure that any adjustment is locked before proceeding.
Wear the Correct Gear:
Wear rubber or work gloves when handling chemicals, moving or stacking lumber, or doing heavy construction.
Wear eye protection, especially when using power tools or striking metal on metal or concrete.
Use a special-purpose tool belt with leather pockets and holders if you want to carry sharp or pointed tools, such as knives, awls or chisels. Never carry such tools in your pockets.
Wear a disposable facemask when you create dust by sawing or sanding. Use a special filtering respirator when working with toxic substances and solvents.
Never work while wearing loose clothing, hanging hair, open cuffs, or jewelry.
Power Tool Precautions:
Always be sure that the electrical setup is safe; be sure that no circuit is overloaded and that all power tools and electrical outlets are properly grounded. Do not use power tools in wet locations.
Always remove the key from any drill chuck (portable or press) before starting the drill.
Always clamp small pieces firmly to a bench or other work surface when using a power tool on them.
Always be aware that your body's reflexes probably are not fast enough to save you from injury from a power tool in a dangerous situation. Be alert!
Always hold a circular saw firmly, usually with both hands so that you know where they are.
Always use a drill with an auxiliary handle to control the torque when large-size bits are used.
Never change a movable part such as a saw blade, a drill or router bit unless the power cord is unplugged. Do not depend on the switch being off; you might accidentally hit it.
Never use a power tool on a surface - large or small - that is not firmly supported.
