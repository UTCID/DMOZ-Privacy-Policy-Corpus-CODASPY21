Please send notification of your wish to return to our customer services team by visiting our Contact Us Page.
Once we have received your cancellation notification, we will arrange to have the Products collected by a nominated carrier and delivered to us. You will have to bear the costs of collection, which is charged at a rate of £7.95 per carton that needs to be collected. We may deduct this charge from any refund that we give to you.
If the value of the Products has been reduced by any amount as a result of your handling of them (beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Products), we may recover that amount from you. We may deduct this amount from any refund that we give to you.
Before collection, we ask that you:
re-package the Product(s) in their original boxes along with the despatch note or order acknowledgement) stating the reason for the return. In the case of a defective product, please provide a full description of the fault;
wrap the package securely; and
label the package(s) with your Sage Pay reference number and collection reference number that will be supplied to you by the customer service representative. There is no need to address the parcel.
Please note that your right to cancel does not depend on complying with these requests but complying will assist us in ensuring that your refund is processed promptly.
