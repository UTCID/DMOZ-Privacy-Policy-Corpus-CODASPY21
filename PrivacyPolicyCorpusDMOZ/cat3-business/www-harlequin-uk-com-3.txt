Alongside digital design technology, our designers love to get the paintbrushes out and experiment with watercolours, gouache, inks and more to create new effects and colour blends. The end results are looks that bend the rules and allow you to be as creative as you choose.     Our pursuit of design innovation probably evolved as a result of our links with manufacturing. We’ve shared a site with a wallpaper factory for over 30 years so our designers really know and understand the products – including how to push the boundaries as technology advances. By mixing innovative production techniques with ambitious, uninhibited design we have earned a global reputation as a high fashion, trend-leading brand.
