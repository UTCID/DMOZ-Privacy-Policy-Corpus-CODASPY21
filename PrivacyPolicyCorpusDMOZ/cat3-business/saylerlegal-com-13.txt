Remote Depositions/Meeting Services
We will assist you in setting up and hosting virtual meetings powered by Zoom. In addition to remote assistance, we also offer on-site depositions/meetings. A conference room is available equipped with large and small screen monitors, web-cams, and conference phones.
We welcome hybrid meetings with physical and remote appearances, and can record your depositions/meetings, providing audio and visual files. A videographer and court reporter may also be arranged for you.
Screen-Share – Provide us your electronic exhibits, images, and information and we will assist you in virtually sharing your documents while we host your Zoom meeting.
Save Time and Money – Don’t worry about wasting time or money traveling to far-away depositions/meetings. We will assist you to appear virtually from wherever you are located.
Personal Attention – Our remote deposition/meeting services allow you to focus all of your attention on your case. The knowledge that your information is secure and confidential will ease your mind as you communicate effortlessly with our assistance.
