If this is the case, you also have a right of access to this personal data and to the information listed in Article 15(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. These include, for example, information on the processing purposes, the categories of personal data being processed and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or are still being disclosed (Article 15(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation).You can find the full scope of your right to information in Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which can be downloaded from the following link: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679.

III. Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)
As a data subject, you have a right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) under the conditions of Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation.This generally means that you have the right to request us to delete personal data concerning you immediately and we are obliged to delete personal data immediately if one of the reasons listed in Article 17 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation applies. This may be the case, for example, where personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed (Article 17(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation).If we have made the personal data public and we are obliged to delete them, we are also obliged, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to take appropriate measures, including technical measures, to inform other controllers who process the personal data, that a data subject has requested that they delete all links to this personal data or copies or replications of this personal data (Article 17 paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation).The right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) shall not apply exceptionally where processing is necessary for the reasons set out in Article 17(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation. This may be the case, for example, where processing is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims (Article 17(3)(a) and (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation).The full scope of your right to erasure can be found in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which can be downloaded from the following link: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679.

This may be the case, for example, if you dispute the accuracy of your personal data. In this case, the processing is limited for a period that allows us to verify the accuracy of the personal data (Article 18(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation).Restriction means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of restricting their future processing (Article 4(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation).The full scope of your right to restrict processing can be found in Article 18 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which can be downloaded from the following link: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679.
V. Right to data transferability
As a data subject, you have a right to data transferability under the conditions of Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation.This means that basically you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, current and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit this data to another controller without our interference, provided that the processing is based on a consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation and the processing is carried out using automated procedures (Article 20(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation).Information as to whether the processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation can be found in the information on the legal bases for processing in Section C of this Privacy Policy.When exercising your right to data transferability, you also have the fundamental right to request that the personal data be transferred directly by us to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible (Article 20(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation).The full scope of your right to restrict processing can be found in Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which can be downloaded from the following link: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679.

E. Analysis tools and advertising
Google Analytics
This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
Google Analytics cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both his website and his advertising.
IP Anonymisation
We have activated the IP anonymisation function on this website. This will cause your IP address to be cut by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services relating to website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
Browser Plug-in
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
Objection to data collection
You can prevent Google Analytics from collecting your data by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set which prevents the collection of your data on future visits to this website: Google Analytics Opt Out
More information on how Google Analytics handles user data can be found in Google’s privacy policy: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en.
Contract data processing
We have concluded a contract with Google for contract data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities for the use of Google Analytics.
Demographic features on Google Analytics
This website uses the “demographic features” function of Google Analytics. This allows reports to be created that contain information on the age, gender and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-related advertising by Google and from visitor data from third-party providers. This data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can disable this feature at any time via the ad settings in your Google Account or generally prohibit Google Analytics from collecting your information as described in the section “Objection to Data Collection”.
Facebook Pixel
Our website uses the visitor action pixel of Facebook, Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”) for conversion measurement.
This enables visitors to be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This allows the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements to be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and future advertising measures to be optimised.
The collected data is anonymous for us as the operator of this website; we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook Data Usage Guidelines. This allows Facebook to serve ads on Facebook pages and outside of Facebook. This use of the data cannot be influenced by us as the site operator.
Please see Facebook’s privacy policy for more information on how we protect your privacy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.
You can also disable the remarketing feature “Custom Audiences” in the Ad Settings section at https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen. You must be logged in to Facebook for this purpose.
If you do not have a Facebook account, you can disable Facebook usage-based advertising on the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance website: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices.
Objection to data collection
You can prevent Facebook from collecting your information by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set which prevents the collection of your data on future visits to this website: Facebook Opt Out. This opt-out cookie can only protect you from data transfer to Facebook on this website and in your browser. If you access another website, change your browser or delete the cookies in your browser, the opt-out cookie and the associated protection against transmissions is no longer active.
