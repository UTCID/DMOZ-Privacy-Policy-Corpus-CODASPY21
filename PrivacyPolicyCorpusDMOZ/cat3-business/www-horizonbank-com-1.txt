Privacy
At Horizon your trust is the foundation of our relationship. Because of our interest in protecting your privacy, our combined companies have adopted the following privacy principles, continuing our commitment to you, our valued customer:
Recognition of Your Expectation of Privacy. We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and financial affairs. We understand the need to safeguard our sensitive information about you that you have entrusted to us within our affiliated family of companies. We maintain standards and procedures designed to prevent misuse of this information.
Our Collection, Retention, and Use of Information about You. We collect, retain, and use information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide products, services, and other opportunities to you. We collect and retain information about you only for specific business purposes. We use information to protect and administer your records, accounts, and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design or improve our products and services; and to understand your financial needs so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service.
Limiting Employee Access to Information. Our employees access information about you only when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs.
Security Procedures to Protect Information. We maintain security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you.
Restrictions on Disclosing Information to Parties Outside Our Affiliated Companies. We do not reveal specific information about your accounts or other personally identifiable data to parties outside our affiliated companies for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by you; 3) the disclosure is required or allowed by law (e.g., subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, etc.).
Maintaining Your Privacy in Business Relationships with Parties Outside Our Affiliated Companies. Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to a party outside our affiliated companies, such as to a vendor or service company that we hire to provide support or services for one or more of our products (i.e., Credit Cards, ATM Cards, etc.). These vendors and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential information about you and your products and services with us and must abide by applicable law. You may visit our website to find out about products and services, marketing information, and career opportunities without providing any information about yourself. We do gather data regarding visits to our Website, including domain name, pages visited, length of user session, etc., to evaluate the usefulness of our site.
We use proven technology and established procedures for keeping your information secure. Whenever we ask for personal information on our Website or Internet banking we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology) to keep it confidential.
The bank may use a software "cookie" when accessing our PC banking product. No "cookie" will contain any information that would enable anyone to contact you via telephone, email, or U.S. Mail. (A "cookie" is a small piece of information which a Website stores in the web browser of your PC and can later retrieve. A "cookie" cannot be read by a web site other than the one that set the "cookie". You can set your web browser to inform you when "cookies" are set or to prevent "cookies" from being set.)
We do not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children. We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.
We take appropriate steps to keep your account information accurate and up to date. If you ever notice that your information is not complete, accurate or current, please call us at (219) 873-2640 or toll-free at (888) 873-2640 to let us know. We will correct the information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that we have not complied with our Information Practices, you may contact us at (219) 873-2640 or toll-free at (888) 873-2640. Please ask for the Compliance Officer. We will investigate and respond to your concern.
Security
This internet banking system uses industry-standard technology, including password-controlled entry, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, date encryption, public-private key pair, firewalls, and filtering routers. Each security component acts as a layer of protection to safeguard sensitive date from unauthorized users.
Password-Controlled Access
First, this system requires customer identification through a private access code and password before you can get into the front-end of the system. You should keep this password and access code absolutely private.
Enhanced Authentication
The new security feature employs two-factor mutual authentication to protect the front door (i.e., log-in) of Horizon'sonline offerings. The new security feature allows account access only after two levels of security have been passed: entry of a valid pass code from a recognized computer or device that then must pass multiple layers of security forensics transparent to the end user. If there is any ambiguity, the system presents a challenge question that must be correctly answered before the user can access account information.
Protect Your Accounts. When someone tries to access an account from an unrecognized computer they must correctly answer challenge questions set-up by the authorized user. So even if the login ID and password have been stolen through spyware, a phony Web site, or even from a handwritten note, the thief would be required to answer a challenge question to get access to the account, preventing the thief from accessing personal account information.
Confirm the Web site's validity. Once the authorized user enters their login ID and click the submit button, they will see their secret image and phrase. If the image and phrase don't appear, the site may be a fraudulent site. This capability targets a fraud called spoofing, and will help ensure that they are not fooled by fake versions of our Web site.
Transmission Security: Encryption
Once you have logged on correctly, you will enter a secure environment in which you can conduct your transactions. The browser automatically secures the session using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. With SSL, data that travels between the bank and customer is encrypted and can only be decrypted with what is called the public and private key pair.
Data that is encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the private key. Conversely, data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted only with the public key. This asymmetry is the property that makes public key cryptography so useful.
Information Privacy: Firewalls and Filtering Routers
Finally, once requests arrive at the bank, the server is protected by a series of firewalls and filtering routers which verify the source and destination of the requests traveling in information packets. The firewall is set up to reject any unauthorized traffic. This reemphasizes the importance of the password, which is the only legitimate entry into the program. This system firewall "opens holes only when necessary and closes them back down as soon as useful work is completed". The purpose of the router is to keep out traffic that does not emanate from one of the only two legitimate ends of a secured transaction: the customer or the bank.
Not withstanding our efforts to ensure that the Bank's online system is secure, you should be aware that the internet is inherently insecure and that all data transfers, including electronic mail, can potentially be monitored and ready by others.
The Internet Banking section is automatically secured/encrypted, but the rest of the Web site can be accessed as either secure or unsecure. To see at a glance if a session is secure:
Check the key icon at the lower-left corner of Netscape's screen. If it is intact and a blue line appears at the top of the screen, all messages are secure.
Check if there is an "s" after the "http" in the URL. The "s" after the "http" denotes that the page is secure.
If using Microsoft® Internet Explorer, and the image of a lock is displayed, the lock indicates the site is secure. If the icon appears as a picture of a broken key or a broken lock, encryption is not in use and the current session is not secure.
To ensure security, we recommend the following:
Never reveal your password**.
**Password refers to your telephone access (audio response system, not Bill Payment) password or the password that you selected when you signed up for Internet Banking. Your financial institution may use a different name. If you have questions about which number to use to access Internet Banking for the first time, contact your financial institution.
