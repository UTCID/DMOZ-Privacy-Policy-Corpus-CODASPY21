Payment Terms11.1. Your use of One Legal Services may result in the incurrence of One Legal Fees and Disbursements of Statutory Fees made on your behalf. You are responsible for paying to One Legal all fees for Services and for reimbursing One Legal for any and all Disbursements.11.2.

Statutory Fees of $20 or more disbursed on your behalf are assessed a 3.3% convenience fee for processing and collecting these Disbursements in accordance with applicable law. This fee will not apply to One Legal Fees. Customers can choose to pay via ACH or eCheck to avoid this fee.11.6. Payment Methods You authorize One Legal to charge your credit card, debit card, or financial institution account (via an automated clearing house (“ACH”) transaction), for all amounts owed to One Legal with respect to Services and Disbursements you ordered via your One Legal Account or otherwise. When you provide a Payment Method to One Legal, you confirm that you are permitted to use that Payment Method. You also authorize One Legal to collect and store the related payment card or financial institution account number(s) or other information, along with other related transaction information (collectively, “Payment Information”). When you make a purchase, you authorize One Legal to charge the full amount of the transaction, including statutory court and witness fees to the Payment Method you designate for the transaction. You also acknowledge and agree that One Legal may share selective Payment Information with third parties, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to One Legal and servicing your One Legal Account. For purposes of this Section titled “Payment Terms”, “One Legal” refers to One Legal LLC along with any service providers chosen by One Legal to provide the Payment Methods. The terms described in this Section titled “Payment Terms” supersede any payment terms stated on your invoices.(a) Authorization to Pay by Credit or Debit Card. If the Payment Method you choose is to pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount up to the amount of the purchase. We will bill your card at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter in the amounts owed to One Legal as indicated on the corresponding One Legal invoices. If you cancel an order before completion, that pre-approval may result in your funds or available credit not being immediately available. If you pay by debit card and your payment results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee. The Administrator (as defined below) may be able to change or update the card information (“Card Information”), including the card number, name on the card, expiration date, and the card verification value (CVV) code, assigned to your One Legal account at a later time or times, and in a manner that One Legal requires in its sole discretion. Unless you are a self-represented litigant, you represent that any credit card used to pay for a purchase from One Legal is a business or commercial card and not a card issued primarily for personal, family or household purposes.(b) Authorization to Pay by ACH. If the Payment Method you choose is to pay by ACH (“ACH Payment Service”), you hereby authorize One Legal to electronically debit or credit, via an ACH transaction, the bank deposit account you designate from time to time (“Bank Account”). By choosing this Payment Method, any convenience fee associated with statutory court and witness fees will be waived. NOTE THAT THE ACH PAYMENT SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS AND IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS OR SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS ENGAGING IN BUSINESS-PURPOSE TRANSACTIONS. These Terms of Service, the related One Legal webpages, and information you input to such webpages (or which One Legal reasonably believes was inputted by you), during your initial enrollment in the ACH Payment Service and any time you update or amend the same (which One Legal may require in its sole discretion), each constitute your authorization to One Legal to debit or credit your Bank Account via ACH transactions (“Authorization”), as provided in these Terms of Service. The following terms and conditions apply to the ACH Payment Service:1. Authorization to Debit and Credit Bank Account. You hereby authorize One Legal to initiate: (a) recurring automatic ACH debits to your Bank Account in the amounts owed to One Legal as indicated on the corresponding One Legal invoices; and (b) ACH credits to your Bank Account to correct any erroneous debits or provide a refund, as approved by One Legal in its sole discretion. Your Authorization also includes permission to collect the following, whether provided as part of the ACH enrollment or when you enrolled in One Legal’s Services generally: (i) your name; (ii) your current mailing address and Bank Account Information (as described in Paragraph 3. below); (iii) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and (iv) the means used by One Legal to authenticate the person providing the Authorization on your behalf as described in the Sections below titled “Administrators and Sub-users” and “Credentials and Authorizing Transactions”. With respect to each ACH transaction you authorize, you agree to be bound by the “National Automated Clearing House Association Operating Rules and Guidelines” (“NACHA Rules”), as may be amended from time to time.2. Timeframe and Amounts of Debits to Bank Account. ACH debits to your Bank Account generally will occur one to five days after the date of the invoice(s) generated by One Legal. You acknowledge that the amounts of the automatic ACH debits to your Bank Account may vary depending on the invoice amounts.3. Bank Account Information. In accordance with procedures established by One Legal, you agree to provide to One Legal the necessary information pertaining to your Bank Account in order to debit or credit your Bank Account via an ACH transaction, including (but not limited to) the name of your financial institution, the financial institution’s routing number, the name(s) of the owner(s) of your checking account designated as the Bank Account, and the account number of the Bank Account (collectively “Bank Account Information”). The Administrator (as defined below) may be able to change or update the Bank Account Information at a later time and in a manner that One Legal requires in its sole discretion.4. Revoking your authorization. This Authorization will remain in full force and effect until you notify One Legal by electronic message at accounting@onelegal.com that you wish to revoke this Authorization. One Legal requires at least 10 business days’ prior written notice in order to revoke (cancel) this Authorization. Revocation will not affect One Legal’s right to initiate ACH credits to your Bank Account in order to correct or adjust any debits that were processed before your revocation became effective.4. Return of ACH Entries. If an ACH payment is returned from your Bank Account for insufficient or uncollected funds or for erroneous information, One Legal may reinitiate the returned ACH debit to your Bank Account within one to five days after the initiation of the first ACH debit. You agree to pay One Legal a returned payment fee of $25 that may be charged by One Legal, for each returned ACH debit from your Bank Account. Any amounts owed to One Legal that cannot be collected by an ACH debit will be charged to the backup credit card on file with One Legal as described below.5. Filing Claims for Alleged Errors. If you believe an ACH debit initiated by One Legal occurred in error, there was an error in the amount of a debit, or any other error, you must file a claim with One Legal at once by contacting One Legal at accounting@onelegal.com, giving One Legal all information you have about the alleged error, and taking any other action(s) as reasonably required by One Legal. You have sixty (60) days after the date of the posting of the ACH debit in question to file a claim. If you file a claim with One Legal after more than sixty (60) days, One Legal will have no obligation to investigate the claim and you will have no right to recover any funds you may have lost as a result of the alleged error. If an error occurs with regard to an ACH credit, One Legal may take any action permitted by law and the NACHA Rules to recover the funds from your Bank Account.6. Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to One Legal that: (i) you are not a self-represented litigant, that you are a business organization or a sole proprietorship, and that the ACH Payment Service will not be used for personal, family or household purposes; (ii) you own the Bank Account; (iii) you have authority on behalf of any other owner(s) of the Bank Account to authorize One Legal to debit the Bank Account as agreed in these Terms of Service; and (iv) all ACH transactions you authorize comply with all applicable laws and the NACHA Rules, as may be amended from time to time.11.7. You must have an account established with One Legal prior to any Services being performed. When establishing an account with One Legal, One Legal requires a valid credit card be placed on file with One Legal as a form of back up payment. You will be billed for all Services provided and all Disbursements, such as statutory court fees, witness fees and other third party fees, including, but not limited to fees charged by the local electronic filing management system provider, made on your behalf. Payment for Services rendered by One Legal is non-refundable. Payment outstanding fifteen (15) days or more beyond the terms stated in an invoice is considered delinquent. Should any invoice become delinquent, One Legal reserves the right to charge the invoice amount to the backup credit card. Because all transactions are conducted electronically, you agree that the physical credit card need not be present with One Legal in order for the charge to the card to be valid, and you agree not to dispute the validity of any such charge on that basis. Returned payments including but not limited to returned checks, ACH, eCheck, and credit card chargebacks may incur returned payment fees of up to $25.00 per retuned payment.11.8. You are liable for payment of all invoices. You may have a third party, such as a client of yours, pay an invoice directly to One Legal. However, it is understood that One Legal has no relationship with such third parties and has no obligation to collect from them. The payment obligation rests solely with you, and One Legal will hold you liable for payment of any invoice submitted to a third party for payment. One Legal reserves the right to impose or reduce the limit on the balance that a customer may owe us, even if not yet billed, for any or no reason. Should any invoice become delinquent and One Legal has to initiate a collections effort, all reasonable collection costs and/or legal fees will be added to the balance due.12. Subscriptions12.1. Subscriptions may be offered for certain One Legal services. Where applicable, subscriptions are on a monthly basis, with the full month’s subscription fee due on the first of each month. Changes, additions, deletions, upgrades and downgrades to your subscriptions can be supported by contacting One Legal customer support. There is no refund for a partial month’s subscription fee upon cancellation.13. One Legal’s Right to Refuse or Delay Services and Other Requests13.1. One Legal may delay or refuse to process any request for a Service or to make a payment via a Payment Method or any other type of request (collectively, “Requests”), including without limitation requests to change or update Card Information or Bank Account Information or to authorize payment via a Payment Method, without prior notice to you if One Legal: (i) is unable to confirm to its satisfaction the person’s identity or his or her authority to make the Request; (ii) believes in its sole discretion that it is prudent for security reasons to take additional measures to verify the authority and/or identity of the person who initiated the Request; (iii) has a suspicion that the transaction may be in violation of applicable law, or the transaction is otherwise under review by One Legal; or (iv) determines that you are delinquent in payment of fees due One Legal. You agree to immediately provide to One Legal any additional information it requests in relation to this Section titled “One Legal’s Right to Refuse or Delay Services and Other Requests”, and agree to any additional methods of verification (as determined in One Legal’s sole discretion) to verify any person’s authority or identity or to verify the authenticity of a Request.13.2. One Legal’s ability to provide the Services and Payment Methods may be dependent upon One Legal’s ability to obtain access to third party vendors, websites and networks (collectively “third party services”). In the event any third party service is unavailable or delayed for any reason, or One Legal determines in its discretion that One Legal cannot continue utilizing a third party service, One Legal may discontinue the Services or any Payment Method, delay your access to the Services or any Payment Method, and/or delay acting on any Request.13.3. Without limiting the foregoing, One Legal is not responsible for any inconvenience, loss or damage you may incur as a result of any discontinuation of or delay in your access to any Service or ability to make a payment to One Legal via a Payment Method, or delay of any Request.14. Administrators and Sub-users14.1. The person that initially creates your One Legal Account will be identified as the administrator (“Administrator”) for your management and use of your One Legal Account. The Administrator will be required to establish a username and password, and such other security devices as One Legal may reasonably establish from time to time, (collectively, “Credentials”) upon creating a One Legal Account. The identity of the Administrator may be changed from time to time in a manner that One Legal requires in its sole discretion. You agree that the Administrator shall have the authority, on your behalf, to: (i) create your One Legal Account; (ii) enroll you in Payment Methods and authorize payments via a designated Payment Method; (iii) initiate Services; (iv) update or change your Bank Account Information or Card Information; and (vi) update your contact information (e.g., address, telephone number, etc.).14.2. The Administrator may from time to time identify one or more sub-users via your One Legal Account (“Sub-users”) or in a manner that One Legal otherwise requires in its sole discretion. The Administrator may also remove or delete any Sub-user via your One Legal Account or in a manner that One Legal requires in its sole discretion. A Sub-user will be required to establish Credentials unique to the Sub-user. You agree that Sub-users are authorized to initiate Services and Disbursements on your behalf that result in payment(s) for Services via a Payment Method designated by the Administrator, but will not be able to: (i) enroll you in a Payment Method; (ii) update or change your Bank Account Information or Card Information; or (iii) update your contact information (e.g., address, telephone number, etc.).14.3. One Legal may suspend the Administrator’s or any Sub-user’s access to your One Legal Account if One Legal, in its sole discretion, reasonably believes the One Legal Account is being used or accessed in an unauthorized, illegal, or disruptive manner. You agree that the Administrator and Sub-users may use the Payment Methods, your One Legal Account, and initiate any Service only: (i) for your own internal business purposes; and (ii) as authorized under, and in accordance with, these Terms of Service and your own internal policies. The Administrator and Sub-users will not initiate Services for or on behalf of any third party, or otherwise allow any third party to use your One Legal Account, without One Legal’s prior written consent.15. Taxes15.1. You shall be responsible for any taxes which One Legal may be required to pay or collect under any applicable law in connection with the Services, and any such amounts paid by One Legal shall be charged to your account.16. Your Information16.1. You agree to:(i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself and/or your organization, as appropriate, as prompted by the One Legal registration form or any other form, including, but not limited to, your e-mail address for notices and any other communications;(ii) maintain and promptly update the foregoing to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete; and(iii) provide any other information that One Legal may request of you from time to time for purposes reasonably related to your use of the One Legal web site or Services.17. Modification of Terms Features and new products may be added to or withdrawn from One Legal without notice17.1. One Legal may at any time, at our sole discretion, update and revise this Agreement (including the types and amounts of Fees). One Legal will notify you of any material change(s) in this Agreement and or Fees by posting the proposed change(s) on the One Legal web site. Any changes that One Legal makes to this Agreement will be effective immediately upon posting. Please check this page periodically for changes to the Agreement; you will be able to determine if this Agreement has been changed since your previous visit by viewing the “Last Updated” information that appears at the top of this Agreement17.2. One Legal also reserves the right to modify or discontinue features and capabilities of the One Legal Services, without advance notice for normal maintenance and enhancements, and to modify or update the One Legal Services documentation located on the web site. Fees pertaining to enhanced and/or new features will be effective immediately upon release of such features.17.2. The continued use of One Legal Services by you or your agents, if applicable, after such notice will constitute acceptance of the change. If you object to such modifications, your sole recourse will be discontinuance of your use of One Legal Services.18. Services Provided As Is – No Warranties18.1. You agree that your use of One Legal Services, your One Legal Account and information on the web site is at your own and sole risk. All Services are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. One Legal disclaims all warranties and duties of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose, non-infringement or title, duties of workman-like effort, or lack of negligence.18.2. One Legal assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions on its web site and is not responsible in any way for the functionality, specifications, or any other aspect thereof. One Legal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to One Legal Services, your One Legal Account or that defects in its web site will be corrected.18.3. One Legal reserves the right at any time and without prior notice to change the hours of operation to limit your access to One Legal in order to perform repairs, make modifications as a result of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of One Legal and to add or withdraw products or features to or from One Legal at any time. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures to satisfy your particular requirements for protection of your system and/or accuracy of data, and for maintaining a means of reconstruction of lost data.18.4. Without limiting the above, you agree that neither One Legal nor any of its parent corporations, subsidiaries, partners, employees, independent contractors, officers, directors, attorneys, agents, affiliates, representatives, successors and/or assigns (each a “One Legal Party”; collectively the One Legal Parties) makes any warranties or undertakes any duties regarding, without limitation, the following:(i) infringement of title or quiet enjoyment;(ii) functionality, including functionality of search or retrieval software;(iii) content, format, accuracy, completeness, or completion of forms;(iv) receipt (timely or otherwise), approval and/or processing of documents by courts and/or any other government agencies;(v) appropriateness or propriety of documents handled with respect to any Services;(vi) timeliness of Services; (vii) uninterrupted, secure, error or virus-free Services or storage;(viii) adequacy of fees paid to courts and/or other government agencies;(ix) any alteration or destruction of a document resulting from third parties’ unauthorized access to or use of One Legal’s website (e.g. computer hackers); and(x) any losses or damages or alteration of a document or information on any party’s computer system or elsewhere resulting from the transmission of computer “viruses” or other damaging or destructive software or software components by or through One Legal.18.5. One Legal is not responsible for and shall have no liability for (i) identifying documents to be included in a case file, for the failure of documents to be included in a case file or for the completeness of a case file document library or case service lists; or (ii) the accuracy or completeness of case service lists identified on any of its One Legal sites or Services; or (iii) the accuracy of information provided by the Court to One Legal or any actions One Legal takes based upon that information, or (iv) the content of any documents that are posted or distributed via its Services or in any case file.18.6. With respect to filing documents with the court, you are solely responsible for transmitting documents correctly and in a timely fashion, for confirming the filing charges on the receipt, and for checking and responding to notifications, email or otherwise, for rejected filings or documents. If you do not receive confirmation within (3) days (or before the expiration of any filing or service deadline) documenting the completion of your assignment, it is your responsibility to immediately contact One Legal and provide details of the document transmission, including the original filing or service receipt, which was generated at the time the filing or service was performed by One Legal, to enable One Legal to determine what action should be taken, and if necessary to manually file and serve such documents before the expiration of any applicable deadline. You waive and release any claims based upon errors, defaults, or omissions if you fail to provide notice and/or resubmit to the Court or otherwise comply with this paragraph.18.7. By uploading content to or submitting any materials, you grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) One Legal a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license, with right to sublicense, to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally display and digitally perform, translate, create derivative works from and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout this universe; provided that One Legal may only exercise the foregoing right and license (a) in connection with its operation and maintenance of the One Legal web site and/or the provision of related goods and services to authorized users and/or their designees, and/or (b) to comply with or satisfy applicable court rules or procedures. You agree that you shall have no recourse against One Legal for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right with respect to your communication with One Legal.19. No Incidental or Consequential Damages19.1. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that none of the One Legal Parties will be liable to you, your successors, agents, heirs or assigns, and/or any other person or entity for general, special, incidental, consequential, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, those damages resulting from loss of use, data, sales, goodwill, or profits, failure to meet any duty (including good faith or reasonable care) whether or not One Legal has been advised of the possibility, or under any legal or equitable theory of liability, including theories of tort, contract, or otherwise arising out of the use of the One Legal web site or Services or the termination of your use of the One Legal web site and Services.19.2. You expressly agree and acknowledge that none of the One Legal parties shall any liability whatsoever with respect to any actions or omissions by any court and/or other government agencies with whom any One Legal party interacts in connection with the services. In particular, none of the One Legal parties shall have any liability with respect to any court and/or Government agency’s failure to provide accurate information to any One Legal party (including but not limited to whether a filing party is entitled to a fee waiver), or to properly or timely receive, file, or process any documents or other materials transmitted by any One Legal party on your behalf.19.3. No One Legal party shall be liable for any loss, injury, claim, liability, or damage of any kind resulting from your use of the One Legal website, the content, the comments, the interactive areas, any facts or opinions appearing on or through an interactive area or any third party communications.

This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before these or any prior Terms of Service were adopted; (iii) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iv) claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Service.25.2. References to “One Legal,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users of the Services under these or prior Terms of Service between us, You agree, by entering into these Terms of Service, that you and One Legal each are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These Terms of Service evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.25.3. Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if if you opt out of these arbitration procedures within 30 days from the date when your first accept these terms (the “Opt Out Deadline”). You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-800-938-8815 or emailing support@onelegal.com to request the opt out form. Any opt out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue any claim in arbitration.26. Notice of disputes26.1. For all disputes and claims, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give One Legal an opportunity to resolve your dispute or claim by sending a written Notice of Dispute (the “Notice”) to One Legal at the following address: Office for Dispute Resolution, One Legal, 1400 N. McDowell Blvd, Suite, 300, Petaluma, CA 94954. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the dispute or claim and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (a “Demand”). If One Legal and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim within 30 days after Notice is received, you or One Legal may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by One Legal or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or One Legal is entitled.26.2. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Service and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Service. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service are void or voidable.26.3. The payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated hereunder will be governed by the AAA Rules; provided, however that for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims under $75,000 determined to be frivolous, One Legal agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in such arbitration proceedings even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.26.4. Unless One Legal and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.27. Class action waiver27.1.
You and One Legal agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.27.2. Further, unless both you and One Legal agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.28. Jury trial waiver28.1. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.29. Governing Law; Jurisdiction29.1. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.30. Force Majeure30.1. One Legal shall not be responsible for delays or failure in performance resulting from acts beyond its reasonable control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, war, riot, actual or threatened acts of terrorism, labor stoppages, governmental actions, fires, floods, utility failures and earthquakes.31. Third Party Rights31.1. The provisions in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of you, the One Legal Parties and the assigns of One Legal and shall not inure to the benefit of any other person either as a third party beneficiary or otherwise.32. Assignment32.1. You may not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of One Legal. One Legal may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties hereunder to any party whatsoever.33. Severability33.1. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, the unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.34. Waiver34.1. The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of the right of such party to assert or rely upon such provision or right in any other instance.35. Miscellaneous; Entire Agreement35.1. This Agreement (including any amendments hereto, your registration form, and the One Legal Privacy Policy) constitutes the entire agreement between you and One Legal. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of the parties as reflected in that provision and the allocation of risks set forth in this Agreement, and agree that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The headings in this Agreement are included for convenience only.36. Acknowledgement36.1. You certify that you have read and understand this Agreement and state that you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.
