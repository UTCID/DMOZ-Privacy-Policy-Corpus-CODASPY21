NB. We are currently facing an unprecedented number of cost price increases from suppliers and the frequency of these means that keeping prices accurate on our website is difficult. We will always try to minimise the effects of supplier increases by buying in volume, but inevitably some selling prices will have to increase from those shown. Please contact our sales team for an accurate quotation whilst our website is updated. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience.
About Us  Terms & Conditions
Terms & Conditions of Sale
The main items contained in our conditions of sale are detailed below.
Should you require a copy of our full Terms and Conditions of Sale, it is available for download in Adobe Acrobat format by clicking here. Also contained in this file is an account application form. Please note however, that we require payment with first order from new customers.
Bryant Unlimited is a trade supplier of products direct to professional users and trade customers. Bryant Unlimited does not provide a retail service to private individuals.
Confirmation Orders
Written confirmation of telephone orders must be clearly marked "Confirmation". If this is not the case and the order is duplicated, goods will only be accepted back for credit on condition that the product is returned at customer's expense and arrives back in saleable condition. Bryant Unlimited reserves the right to levy a 15% handling charge on any returns.
Part Deliveries
Wherever possible we try to ship entire orders. However, part deliveries will automatically be made unless otherwise requested.
Order Cancellation
Orders for stock items can usually be cancelled without charge if the goods have not been despatched. If the goods have already left our premises, carriage and handling will be deducted from the credit note issued. Cancellation of orders for 'special order' items will not be accepted unless the manufacturer is prepared to accept their return. Cancellation of any 'custom manufacture' as subject to agreement with Bryant Unlimited and at the very least will incur charges for any work already carried out
Returns
If you need to return any items to Bryant Unlimited, please contact the Sales department to obtain a Returns Authorisation Number, which must be shown clearly on the outer packaging and any enclosed paperwork.
Faulty items will be replaced or, where possible, repaired and returned.
Items supplied correctly in accordance with your order will be subject to carriage and handling charges.
Please ensure that the products are packed correctly and are insured as you will be responsible for any damage in transit. Credit will not be given if the items have been used or are damaged.
Damages and Shortages
Damage and shortages must be reported within 7 days from date of invoice.
Despatch
Subject to product availability, all orders placed before 3.30 pm UK time will be despatched same day. This will be confirmed by our salesman at the time of order.
Carriage
For the most part, carriage within the UK mainland is free for any orders over £200.00 ex VAT. Light goods will be despatched by recorded post. Heavier consignments will be sent on a standard 1 to 2 day service (currently by UK Mail or TNT).
Large / voluminous products that do not qualify for free carriage are marked with this icon on their product page. However, the carriage charge for these products may be waived if these items form part of a large order - please contact our salesteam at the time of order confirmation.
If you require your goods guaranteed next day, then there is a choice of transport available, which will incur carriage charges. Please discuss this with your salesman.
Unless otherwise stated on the order, all orders received by fax or email will be sent out on standard 1 to 2 day free carriage if applicable.

International Sales
Prices shown in catalogues are ex-works Croydon. Carriage and insurance will be quoted on request. We reserve the right to implement a documentation charge where appropriate. EUR1, certificates of origin and legalised documents are chargeable.
Payment
Credit accounts are available to established businesses subject to completion of an account application form and receipt of positive references. However, company policy is to require pre-payment with first order, for which a pro-forma invoice will be issued.
Part shipments will be invoiced accordingly, and must be paid when due. Account terms are strictly 30 days nett from date of invoice. Any account with a balance over 30 days will be put 'on stop' until the overdue amount has been cleared. Continual failure to comply with these terms will result in credit facilities being withdrawn immediately.
An account application form is available to download from the 'About Us -> Account Application Form' menu item above.
Credit Cards and Payment Cards
For customers without a credit account, Bryant Unlimited accepts payment using American Express, Mastercard, Visa and most debit cards.
Ownership
The title to goods supplied by Bryant Unlimited will not pass to the buyer until the agreed price has been paid in full. Placing an order with Bryant Unlimited is deemed as acceptance of this clause.
Prices
All prices shown are exclusive of VAT, which will be added at the rate ruling at date of despatch. We reserve the right to alter prices if necessary. Should this affect items on your order, then you will be contacted for approval before the goods are shipped. Goods will be invoiced at the price ruling at date of despatch. Current prices are shown on the product page on the web site and a spreadsheet containing current pricing is available for download from the 'Catalogue -> Download PDF' menu item above.
