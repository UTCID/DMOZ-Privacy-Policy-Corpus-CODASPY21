Privacy Policy
Mattson Technology, Inc., including our parent company and all of our subsidiaries, (collectively referred to as “Mattson,” the “Company” or “we”) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that any personal data collected through our website (www.mattson.com) is maintained safely. This site also collects and stores certain information automatically using cookies and similar technologies, including IP addresses, the region or general location of a computer or device accessing the internet, browser type, operating system, page view history, and other usage information.  However, to the extent that any cookie can uniquely identify a computer, mobile device, or tablet (“Device”), or the person using that Device, and you are an European Economic Area (“EEA”) resident, under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), this is Personal Data. Therefore, this Privacy Policy shall apply to such Personal Data collected by Mattson.
This policy describes the Personal Data we collect through our website (online) and in the regular course of business (offline), and how that Personal Data is used, retained and shared. By using or accessing our website, or by providing Personal Data to us on or through our website, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and that by accessing this website or otherwise providing us with Personal Information, you agree to this Privacy Policy and relevant Terms of Service.
Online Collection of Personal Data
We collect personal data from and about our website users, both directly when you provide it and automatically while you visit our website, as follows:
Personal Data You Provide. Personal Data or Personal Information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Through our website, Mattson may request, or provide an opportunity to submit, personal data in connection with an online feature or service. Information Collected Automatically. We use Cookies and/or Universally Unique Identifiers, which are very small data files transferred to your computer, smartphone or other electronic device, to collect information when you direct your browser to our website. This information is automatically recorded from the device you use to visit the website and stored in our server log files. We may collect information about your equipment and browsing actions, including  but not limited to: (i) the browser types and versions used, (ii) the operating system used by the accessing system, (iii) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (iv) the sub-websites, (v) the date and time of access to the website, (vi) an Internet Protocol (IP) address, (vii) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (vii) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems. This information allows Mattson to make its website more useful by storing information about users’ preferences, and helps us (i) track user traffic patterns and analyze trends, (ii) optimize the content of our website, (iii) monitor the security and integrity of our website and information technology platforms, and (iv) as required by law, provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
Location data:  When you access our website (either public or internal) by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store location data, which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location Data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Location Data may be used to personalize and customize your experience when using the Service, facilitate the functionality of certain features within the Service, and to improve the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of Location Data is impaired or disabled.
Use of Personal Data
Personal Data you submit either online or offline, in the regular course of business will be used only to the extent necessary to meet our Legitimate Business Interests. This includes responding to inquiries or requests (including requests for customer support or technical assistance), to otherwise perform our obligations or act consistently with our terms of service, to respond to law enforcement or other governmental or legal authorities, and to otherwise use the information consistent with your instructions to. If you wish to change these instructions, please see “Managing Your Information” below.
By providing your Personal Information or by accessing our online services, you acknowledge that Mattson may use your Personal Data for marketing purposes consistent with this policy. Marketing may include sending you communications about our products and services or other communications targeted to your interests. Additionally, we may use your Personal Data to execute an agreement or transaction concluded either online or offline and to meet our legal obligations with regards to the agreement or transaction.
Note to Job Applicants. For job applicants to use our online employment application service, certain information, including but not limited to name, address, contact numbers and work history, is required for the application to be fully considered. This information is used primarily for the purposes of determining the applicant’s suitability for employment, but Mattson reserves the right to use the information for other purposes consistent with this policy.
The Legal Basis We Have for Collection of Your Personal Data
The CCPA and GDPR requires covered businesses or data collectors, such as Mattson, to disclose the legal basis to collect and use the Personal Data of California consumers and EEA residents, respectively. Therefore, this section shall apply to any such Personal Data collected by Mattson.
Mattson uses the Personal Data that you provide to supply you with high-quality products and services as you request, to send important notices, and for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, product fulfilment, satisfaction of contractual terms and research (“Legitimate Business Interests”). This section also applies to collection of Personal Data with respect to Vendors, Suppliers and other Service Providers.
The legal basis for processing your Personal Data is your consent and/or by contractual agreement. Either by providing Personal Data by digital, electronic or paper means you consent to the collection and processing of your Personal Data.  In the event that you have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), Vendor Request Forms, or other commercial agreement, you have entered into a legally binding contract which requires the disclosure of Personal Data for Mattson to fulfill its obligations under the NDA or other commercial agreement for the specific purposes described therein and in subsequent contracts/agreements in furtherance of your stated interests in Mattson products, services or other commercial relationships. In certain circumstances we may otherwise process your Personal Data if Mattson has a Legitimate Business Interest in doing so.
Retention and Deletion of Personal Data
We will store your Personal Data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the Personal Information is processed. We may retain your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically reasonably feasible to remove it. Consistent with these requirements, upon request, we will try to delete your Personal Information in a timely manner.
Sharing of Personal Data
We may disclose or share your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our Legitimate Business Interests. We do not share your Personal Data with any third party for that party’s marketing purposes, although we may also disclose your information to certain third parties as described below:
Service Providers and Agents. We may share Personal Data with outside service providers or agents for Legitimate Business Interests. Legal Compliance or Enforcement. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties when we believe disclosure is necessary to: (i) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal process, including a law enforcement, regulatory or court-authorized request; or (ii) protect the rights, property or safety of Mattson.Business Transfers. We may disclose your Personal Information as necessary in the event of a proposed or actual reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, financing, or other disposition of all or any portion of Mattson’s business, assets or equity.Non-Personal Data. We may disclose aggregated information about our website users, and information that does not identify or allow for the identification of a particular person, at our discretion.
Data Security
Mattson has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and store. Note that no security measures are 100% foolproof, and no network or system (including ours or transmission of information over the Internet) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to information we collect and store. If you believe your information may not be secure for any reason, please contact us immediately at privacypolicy@mattson.com.
Managing Your Information
You have choices to access information we collect about you and about how we use or disclose that information. This section details those choices, including how you can exercise rights with respect to your information (including personally identifiable information), how you can opt out of collection and use of certain types of information for certain purposes (such as marketing), and how you can use your browser or third-party tools to disable certain collection methods (such as cookies or tracking technologies).
We may use some of the information we collect for marketing purposes, including to send you promotional communications about new Mattson features, products, events, or other opportunities. If you wish to stop receiving these communications or to opt out of our using your information for these purposes, you can contact us at privacypolicy@mattson.com to opt out.
Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Do Not Track – How to Opt-Out
If you prefer not to accept cookies or otherwise wish to disable our use of tracking technologies, most browsers and mobile devices allow you to change your settings so as to notify you when you receive cookies or other tracking technologies are being used, and to choose whether or not to accept/allow it. Most browsers also allow you to disable or delete existing cookies or to automatically reject future cookies. Disabling cookies may limit your ability to use the services.
Currently, Mattson’s infrastructure does not utilize Do Not Track functionalities. Do Not Track is a privacy preference that you can set in your web browser to indicate that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected across websites when you have interacted with that service on the page.
Accessing and Updating Personal Data
