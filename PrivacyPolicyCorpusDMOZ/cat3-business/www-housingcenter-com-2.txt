How Do We Collect Your Information?
The method HAI Group uses to collect your data is also dependent on your relationship with us or your interactions with the organization. Information is collected in one of the following three ways.
1. Information Collected Automatically
Certain non-personal information is collected automatically when you first access the HAI Group website and accept the use of cookies. More specifically, this information is made available to us through persistent and session cookies. Persistent cookies are tiny pieces of data that are stored on your device until expiration or deletion from the device, whereas session cookies are automatically removed from your device when the computer is turned off or the internet browser is closed. Cookies collect information such as your browser type, IP address, time spent on pages, pages visited, and anonymous traffic data. They further assist us in collecting important business and technical statistics to make your online experience more personalized and efficient. We do not track users across time or across websites, and we do not use flash cookies.There are three different categories of cookies that we use to collection information.
Required Cookies
The basic features and functions of the HAI Group website rely on required cookies to operate properly. These required cookies facilitate basic features such as the functioning of images that need to load or the process that allows users to select cookie preferences.
Functional Cookies
This type of cookie allows HAI Group to use your data collected to enhance your personal experience on the website as well as improve website performance. For example, it is this type of cookie that allows the website to save your log-in information, preventing you from having to log in each time you visit the website.
Third-Party Cookies
Data collected with these cookies may be shared with third-parties for ad targeting and advertising purposes, as well as to allow you to share certain pages with social networks and to post comments on the HAI Group website. The information collected from these cookies helps to build an overview of how you interact with our website in order for us to optimize your experience.
HAI Group may also use other data-collecting technologies to automatically gather non-personal data in order to measure marketing efforts.
2. Information Provided by You
All information HAI Group automatically collects, as outlined above, is non-personal information that does not identify you. HAI Group only receives and collects personal information when you provide such information in one of the following ways. Please note this list is not exhaustive and HAI Group may receive personal information you provide in other ways that may not be included below.
Online forms
As a customer
Purchasing a ticket to an event
Subscribing to a newsletter
Direct communications with employees of HAI Group
Processing an insurance claim through HAI Group
The type of information you provide is dependent on the form or way in which the data was submitted. A few examples of personal information that you may provide, which will be collected and processed, are: name, address, telephone number, birthday, email address, work, employer, or education information, gender identity, citizenship, etc.
3. Information Provided by Partners and/or Public Sources
HAI Group, in some circumstances, may collect information about you from third parties, social media services, HAI Group partners, or other public sources. This information is used to gain a better understanding of the individuals that use HAI Group services and may be combined with other information we’ve received or collected.
How Do We Protect Your Information?
We take all appropriate measures to protect the security of any and all information collected or maintained by us. HAI Group uses methods such as encryption, firewalls and information access controls. We also implement anonymization, which removes personal identifiers from most data collected. Despite this, the Internet is not a secure medium, and no security system is 100 percent secure. Because of this, HAI Group cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data, and we do not assume responsibility for the data you submit to us. We cannot guarantee that the information communicated to us by you will be received or that it will not be altered before or after you transmit it to us. You agree that HAI Group is not liable for any loss or damage incurred due to any interception, modification, deletion, destruction, misappropriation, or use of information provided through our website.

Information Retention
We retain personal information for the shortest possible period of time, as required to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it is collected, unless you continue to consent to ongoing processing or a longer retention period is required by law. After fulfillment is complete, or you withdraw your consent, your data will be deleted from our systems in accordance with our retention policies and procedures.
Children’s Privacy

Under no circumstances may anyone under age 13 use our website or provide us with information.  Parents or legal guardians of children under 13 cannot agree to these terms on their behalf.

HAI Group® is a marketing name used to refer to insurers, a producer, and related service providers affiliated through a common mission, management, and governance. Property-casualty insurance and related services are written or provided by Housing Authority Risk Retention Group, Inc.; Housing Authority Property Insurance, A Mutual Company; Housing Enterprise Insurance Company, Inc.; Housing Specialty Insurance Company, Inc.; Innovative Housing Insurance Company, Inc.; Housing Investment Group, Inc.; and Housing Insurance Services, Inc. (DBA Housing Insurance Agency Services, Inc. in NY and MI). Members of HAI Group provide commercial property and casualty insurance to affordable housing organizations, public housing authorities, and related entities. Not all products are available in all states. Coverage is subject to the terms of the policies actually issued. A risk retention group or surplus lines insurer may provide certain coverages. Risk retention groups and surplus lines insurers do not participate in state guaranty funds, and insureds are therefore not protected by such funds if insured by such entities. For a complete list of companies in the HAI Group family, visit www.housingcenter.com.
