Last Updated: March 11, 2020
The Entrust Group (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Entrust”), oversees this website, including the services underlying the site and the content appearing herein, www.theentrustgroup.com (collectively, the “Site”). These Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”) are applicable to you (“User,” “you,” or “your”). The terms contained herein apply to all Users of this Site.
Read these Terms of Use carefully before you begin using this Site. BY ENTERING, ACCESSING, BROWSING, SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE, ITS SERVICES, AND THE CONTENT AVAILABLE HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.
Note that these Terms of Use may be updated from time to time, and any User’s continued use of this Site after we have made updates to the terms is considered acceptance of those updates. For clarity, all updates are effective immediately when posted. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for updates.
1. Access and Use of This Website
Access to certain portions of the Site is restricted to registered Users. You might be required to provide your name, telephone number(s), e-mail, and/or street address, credit card number, debit card number, charge card number, checking account, banking account, or other payment information, as well as any other personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”). By providing such information, you acknowledge and agree that we may, and you specifically authorize us, or permitted third parties, to process all transactions related to this Site and its operation, including without limitation purchases and/or registration for products and/or services on this Site. You agree to pay all fees and charges, including applicable taxes and surcharges, incurred through your activity on or through the Site and/or through your account/profile.
Creating a User Account — You may be asked to provide, and we will collect, certain types of Personal Data, when you create a user account, which may include your first and last names, e-mail address, zip code, birth month and year, social security number, and a profile picture. You will also be asked to generate a password as part of your login credentials.
Creating an Account for Minor Children – MINORS SHOULD NOT CREATE ACCOUNTS ON THE SITE. However, parents of minors may create accounts for their minor children. As a parent creating an account for your minor child, in addition to the Personal Data set forth above, you may also be asked to provide your child’s first and last name, address, zip code, birth month and year, social security number, and a copy of their social security card and birth certificate. You may also be asked to provide a copy of your driver’s license or passport to verify the relationship. To the extent that we may share information with third-party service providers for purposes of authenticating your account set-up, whether for adults or minors, we reserve the right to send only information that is pertinent to that purpose.
a. Registration and Security. You agree, represent, warrant, and guarantee that all Personal Data provided by you is true, accurate, complete, up-to-date, and solely yours. You may not impersonate, imitate, or pretend to be somebody else when registering. When you create an account and subsequently log in, you will be asked to choose a password. You are responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You will be solely responsible for any activities or actions taken under your account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You must notify us immediately if you know or suspect that any unauthorized person is using your password or your account (for example, your password has been lost or stolen, someone has attempted to use the services or Site through your account without your consent or your account has been accessed without your permission). We strongly recommend that you do not use the services or access the Site on any public computer. We also recommend that you do not store your password through your web browser or other software.

b. Additional Security Considerations. In addition to your user ID and password, we may ask you to create and provide responses to additional authentication questions that only you and Entrust will know to verify your identity. We will also require multi-factor authentication to further safeguard your account. For example, you may be asked to create these questions and responses periodically and will be presented with a question and prompted for a response at random when you login to access the Site and its services, including without limitation the IB Platform. These questions and your correct responses help us to provide stronger protection for your Account information and Trading Activity. We reserve the right to prevent access to the Site and any of its services, platforms, and content for security reasons or if we suspect fraud. You agree to cooperate with us in the investigation and prosecution of any person who has obtained and used your user ID and password without your authorization.
