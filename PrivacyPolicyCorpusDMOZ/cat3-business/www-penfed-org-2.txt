Cookie Policy
Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy describes the cookies that Pentagon Federal Credit Union ("PenFed", "we", "us" or “our”) uses when you visit our website located at www.penfed.org, and each of our associated domains (together, the "Sites"), our mobile applications (the "Apps,"), and other services of ours that you use when you communicate with us (collectively, the "Services").
Effective Date
This Cookie Policy is effective as of March 4, 2019
What is a Cookie?
A “Cookie” is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the Cookie to you.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies typically fall into the following categories:
A First-Party Cookie refers to a Cookie created by the domain of the website the user is visiting.
A Third-Party Cookie is a Cookie that is placed by a domain other than that of the website the user is visiting.
A Session Cookie is temporary, linking the actions of a user during the any given browser session. When the browser is closed, the cookie is deleted.
A Permanent Cookie, also known as a persistent Cookie, is stored for a specific period of time and activates each time the user visits the website that created the Cookie.
A “Web Beacon” (also called a “pixel tag” or “clear GIF”) is a piece of computer code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic.
Types of Pixels tags commonly used are as follows:
Essential - used to help you move around the website and use basic functions. If these are disabled you may not be to use all functions of the website.
Advertising - Used to deliver advertisements (ads) more relevant to you. They will also limit the number of times you might see a specific ad as well as measure the effectiveness of the ad campaign. They remember your device's visit to the website and help us to understand what products and services interest you the most. This allows us to better tailor ads to your interests.
Analytics - Used to measure website traffic, sessions, time on page and other metrics tied to actions taken across the website. This allows us to improve the overall user experience on our site.
To learn more about Cookies, web beacons, and other data collection technology, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
How Do We Use Cookies and other Data Collection Technology?
PenFed and authorized third-party service providers use Cookies, Web Beacons and other similar technology (collectively, “Data Collection Technology”) on the Sites and Apps to help us improve your online experience.  PenFed uses data gathered about website activity (e.g., demographic data, browser type, IP address, pages visited, the day and time of visit) to recognize past users, to enable you to move around or use basic functions on the Sites or the Apps, to better understand the interests of users and website visitors, to improve the website to enhance the visitor experience, and to provide more relevant advertisements both on and off our domains. We also use Data Collection Technology to target users for certain types of content and provide a better user experience.
