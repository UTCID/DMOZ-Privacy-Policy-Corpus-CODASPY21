Privacy Policy
We are committed to protecting your privacy
Spa Staff.com Limited is committed to protecting users' privacy. We will do our best to ensure that any information you give us remains private, other than for the purposes for which you have given it to us, as explained here and in our Terms of Use and Terms of Business.
We store and process information to improve our services
The data you give us is essential for us to provide you with the service of matching employment opportunities with CVs. Additionally, information gathered from users allows us to identify what works and what doesn't with our system, so that we can make it even more useful. Without disclosing personal details, we may share aggregated data with others, to enable us to design and implement improvements. Names and contact details will only be shared with your express permission. Candidates' identifying details, such as name and email address, will only be given to interested employers at the specific request of candidates. Only at your request will your email address be used to inform you of other services provided by Spa Staff.com, its affiliates or third party companies. Exceptionally, and only if required by law, your personal details and details of your usage of the site would be disclosed to the relevant authorities.

Any information you have provided to Spa Staff.com will be promptly removed if you ask us to do so in writing (or by email). Spa Staff.com Limited is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the information provided by you or anyone else.
Security of on-line payment transactions is not guaranteed
While personal and credit card details are handled by a secure server, we cannot guarantee the privacy of your personal and credit card details; nevertheless, the encryption used should be sufficient to prevent its interception in all but the most extreme cases. Contact us for more information on this if you wish. Spa Staff.com is not liable should there be a security breach, and/or any resulting misuse of your credit card details.
