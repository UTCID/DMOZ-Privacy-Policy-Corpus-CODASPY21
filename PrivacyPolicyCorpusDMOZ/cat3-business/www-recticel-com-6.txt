Below, we provide in a nutshell what this means for you.
Recticel may collect your personal data
Personal data are data which allow us to identify you as an individual, like your name, address, phone number. On the other hand, anonymized data are not personal data because they do not identify you, for example: statistics regarding the number of visitors to our webpages.
You can visit our website without providing any personal data.
Recticel uses your personal data
We limit our processing of personal information to what is necessary for the intended purpose (eg. to fulfill our contractual obligations towards you, to comply with legal obligations…) or for the purpose for which you provided consent (eg. receiving a newsletter, providing you with information you requested…). We do not collect sensitive personal information (as defined by EU Regulation 2016/679) from you without first obtaining your explicit consent.
We may share your information:
With selected business partners, but only after you have explicitly provided your consent.
With external service providers who perform certain services on Recticel’s behalf, such as an agency which will deliver your order to your address or which sends out newsletters for us.
We may transfer your data to a Recticel entity or a third party established outside of the EEA. If we do, we implement personal data transfer agreements based on the standard clauses published by the European Commission to protect your personal data.
Your Rights
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, you have the right to: (a) access your personal data; (b) request rectification of your personal data; (c) request portability of your personal data; (d) request restriction of processing of your personal data; (e) object to the processing of your personal data; (f) request erasure of your personal data; (g) request cancellation of your personal data; and (h) if you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
If you are a resident in France, you have the additional right to make general or specific arrangements for the storage and communications of you personal data after your death.
To exercise any of your rights, please contact us as set out below in the “Contact” section.
Recticel preserves your data
We will keep and process your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which we received your personal data, taking into account our possible legal and contractual obligations towards you.
If the legal basis for processing is your explicit consent, we will keep and process your personal data for a maximum period of 2 (two) years. When we provide you the opportunity to unsubscribe, and you choose not to, the period of 2 (two) years is calculated from the date we offered you to unsubscribe.
During the time that we keep your personal data, we will take the technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security to protect them.

Recticel uses cookies. What does this entail ?
What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small file that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. It helps to navigate from page to page on a website, provide secure connections, and remembers preferences from a previous visit, when you return.
Below, we explain the function of the different types of cookies you will encounter on our website.
You will find more information regarding cookies on http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm.
Cookies On Our Website
Operational cookies: Recticel uses operational cookies. These are small files placed on your computer or device to help you navigate from page to page on the Recticel website. For example, without such cookies, you would need to provide your language preference every time you switch to a different page on the Recticel website. These cookies are thus essential for easy use of the site.
Non-Operational Cookies: We also use cookies to provide other services or to help us improve our products and services. Some cookies provide us statistics about the number of visitors and the web pages viewed. This information helps us to design more useful content for you. Some of these cookies are third party cookies.
Third Party Cookies: We sometimes use third party cookies, like for Google Analytics (__utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmz, __utmv) or for Youtube (embedded videos : PREF, VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE, YSC). These are non-operational cookies. If we use them, we will inform you of the purpose of the third party cookies and request your consent to store them.
If we use non-operational cookies, we will request whether you accept our use of cookies. If you do not accept such cookies, some services and functionalities do not work. In particular, this may limit your use of the site and its various features, and reduces our ability to improve our products and services and provide engaging content.
How can you manage the cookies?
Most browsers support cookies, but you can set your browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever you like. You can manage the cookies yourself by adapting your preferences in your browser. The exact process depends on which browser you are using, which can be easily found via your search function on internet.
Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses non-operational cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyse how visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States . At the request of Recticel, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating how the website is used, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. The IP-anonymisation is active on this website. This means that your IP address is truncated within the area of Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address will be first transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note though that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
You can also opt-out from being tracked by Google Analytics with effect for the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Addon for your current web browser: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
