Collection of your Personal Information
Bushwacker collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Bushwacker also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Bushwacker. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Bushwacker for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Bushwacker Web site.
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Bushwacker public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Bushwacker does not read any of your private online communications.
Bushwacker encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Bushwacker so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Bushwacker is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Bushwacker and Bushwacker family of Web sites.
Use of your Personal Information
Bushwacker collects and uses your personal information to operate the Bushwacker Web site and deliver the services you have requested. Bushwacker also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Bushwacker and its affiliates. Bushwacker may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
Bushwacker does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Bushwacker may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Bushwacker may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Bushwacker, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
Bushwacker does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
Bushwacker keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within Bushwacker, in order to determine what Bushwacker services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Bushwacker to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
Bushwacker Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Bushwacker or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Bushwacker; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Bushwacker, or the public.
