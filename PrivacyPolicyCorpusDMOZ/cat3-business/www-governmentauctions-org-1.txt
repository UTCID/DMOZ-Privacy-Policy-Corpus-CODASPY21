premises and of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties do hereby agree as follows:
1. Parties. This Agreement
(the "Agreement" or the "Terms of Use") is between and among Cyweb Holdings Inc.
(the "Firm" or the "Company"), an organization having its principal place of Business in Nassau
County, New York, USA, and you, the user of this website ( the "User"
or "you").
2. Use. By Continuing
to use this web site (or by registering for a member account), you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the
Agreement between you and the Firm.
3. Eligibility.
GovernmentAuctions.org (the "Site" or the "Business") is a website owned, and a business conducted, by the Firm that allows
the Site's
members to view information and materials on government and other related auctions and auction
sources, as well as other relevant information and materials, published
by Firm. No one under the age of 18 may use
this Site. By registering for membership to the Site, or otherwise in any way
using the Site, the User agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use. This
Agreement sets out the legally binding terms for the User's use and membership,
and failure to comply will result in immediate termination of User's membership
privileges. From time to time, this Agreement may be modified by the Firm
without any notice. If the modifications are significant, the Firm will likely
attempt to notify the User at the email address the User provides upon
registering or that the Firm otherwise has on file, but neither the Firm not the
Site are under any
obligation to do so. It is solely the User's responsibility to check these Terms
of Use for any updates or modifications. Changes to these term of use are
effective upon notice to User by e-mail, posting at or via hyperlink to the Site, or by mail.
4. Membership. Access to government
auction and other listings requires a paid
membership subscription. The
current rates for Full Membership to the Site are
$19.95 for one time 1
month of Access, which automatically rebills monthly until cancelled. The
initial monthly charge takes place at the expiration of any FREE TRIAL period.
If you cancel your membership prior to such expiration, your membership will be
suspended and you will not be charged. If you have had a subsription with Site
at anytime in the past, you are not eligible for any FREE TRIAL. Payment for the membership provided to you at and/or
through this site may be made by automatic credit card, check or bank debit or
through any other facility available during the registration process, and you
hereby authorize the Firm and/or its authorized agent (the "Agent"),  to transact such payments on your behalf by
charging your credit card (or other approved facility) for the subscription fees
according to the billing terms for membership posted on these Terms of Use at
the time of payment. REFUND POLICY: Subscription fees are earned upon receipt, but any monthly subscription fee is refundable within the first 30 days from when it was paid. Once 30 days passes from payment, that fee is non-refundable regardless of how long the User remains a member. The User agrees
to be personally liable for all charges incurred by the User during or through
the use of the Site. The User's liability for such charges shall continue after
termination of the User's membership for any reason.
Unless the User has good reason to
believe the credit card (or other approved facility) the User uses to purchase
the User's membership is lost or stolen, the User promises and agrees not to report
that credit card (or other approved facility) as lost or stolen; and not to
dispute any authorized charge by the Agent or the Firm.

current rate for membership, the User also becomes a Member of the Site (a "Member"), and,

username and/or password to other parties and making Member's user name and/or
password available where others may access them. The Member must keep Member's

consent of the Firm.  The Firm reserves the right to transfer this

User's access to any of the Materials, whereby the User specifically, but
without limitation, promises and agrees not to:
(i) Call upon, solicit, divert, take
away or attempt to call upon, solicit, divert or take away any past,

acknowledges is worldwide;
(ii) Hire, attempt to hire, contact or solicit
with respect to hiring for the User or on behalf of any other person any present

purpose of establishing or operating a business substantially similar to the
Business in the Territory;

foregoing provisions, conduct a business substantially similar to the Business,
whether or not under the name "GovernmentAuctions.org" or any other trade
names, trademarks or service marks used by the Firm in the Territory.
The covenants in subsections (i)
through (vi) above are intended to restrict the User from competing in any manner with
the Firm or the Business in the activities that have heretofore been carried on
by the Firm. The obligations set forth in subsections (i) through (vi) above

lender, partner, joint venturer or in any other individual or representative or
affiliated capacity whatsoever. However, none of the foregoing shall prevent
User from being the holder of up to 5.0% in the aggregate of any class of
securities of any corporation engaged in, directly or indirectly, the activities
described in subsections (i) through (vi) above, provided that such securities
are listed on a national securities exchange or reported on Nasdaq.
12. Enforcement of Covenants of
No Competition. User acknowledges that a violation or attempted violation of
any of the covenants and agreements in Section 11 above will cause such damage to
the Firm as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to
ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and
accordingly, the User agrees that the Firm shall be entitled as a matter of
right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,
restraining such violation or attempted violation of such covenants and
agreements by the User, or the affiliates, partners or agents of such User, as
well as recover from the User any and all costs and expenses sustained or
incurred by Firm in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees. User agrees that no bond or other security shall be
required in connection with such injunction. User further agrees that the
periods of restriction set forth in Section 11 above shall be tolled during any
period of violation thereof by the User. Any exercise by the Firm of its respective rights pursuant to this Section 12 shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other remedies to which Firm may be entitled.
13. Specific Validity of
Provisions in Sections 11 and 12.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, if it should ever be held that any provision contained in Sections 11 or 12
does not contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area or scope
of activity to be restrained, then the court or other tribunal so holding shall,
at the request of the Firm, reform such provisions to the extent necessary to
cause them to contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and
scope of activity to be restrained and to give the maximum permissible effect to
the intentions of the parties as set forth herein; and the court or other
tribunal shall enforce such provisions as so reformed.
