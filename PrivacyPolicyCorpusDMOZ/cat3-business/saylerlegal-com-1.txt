SCCTLA Judicial Council ends COVID-19 Emergency Bail Schedule
The Judicial Council of California voted to end the COVID-19 emergency bail schedule, as California begins a phased re-opening and courts restore services shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Judicial Council voted 17-2 to rescind, effective June 20, the COVID-19 temporary bail schedule that set presumptive bail at $0 for people accused of lower-level crimes, a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19 in jails and surrounding communities.
At the same time, California Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye rescinded her statewide order (link) extending time for defendants to be arraigned. That change would require defendants again be arraigned within 48 hours.

COVID-19 Safe Serving Policy
Sayler Legal Service, Inc. has adopted a Covid-19 Safe Service Policy and employees will follow CDC guidelines (masks, gloves, temperature check, hand sanitizer, etc.) In addition, the following policy has been implemented:
Process Servers will knock, then retreat a minimum of six feet from the doorway. If six feet is not possible (such as in an apartment complex), the Process Server will retreat the maximum distance possible under the circumstances.
Process Servers will conduct identification at a distance, requesting confirmation of residency and confirm identity as normal. We will state that due to social distancing requirements, we will be leaving the documents six feet away on either the ground or other appropriate location.
Process Servers will then retreat at least six feet away and allow the subject to retrieve the documents in view. Process Servers will remain present for a reasonable time until they can visually confirm the documents have been retrieved.
We are currently serving all types of papers in Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.
