Site Optimization and Usage Tracking
In order to assure your visits to our websites are completely satisfactory, our system automatically identifies which browser you are using, the IP (Internet Provider) you used for access, and your Operating System. We do not collect any personal information from your hard drive. We also track user traffic patterns throughout our website. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas, as well as the kinds of products that most interest our customers. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue building a better site for you. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies (discussed below). We contract with third parties to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt out” of our ability to analyze such data by clicking the following link http://www..com/privacy/analytics.html and following the instructions provided.
Cookies
We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to place an order, participate in an auction, post ratings or reviews, log in, or access the “My Account” section.
Web beacons
Web beacons are small, transparent graphics that are placed on our website to track how you arrive at our website and what you do at the website. We may use web beacons to track web affiliate sales, customers’ browsing activities at our website, or to compile sales and statistical data. This information assists us in enhancing your shopping experience.
Supplementation of Information
In order to provide our services to you, we may supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources. For example, for credit card payments, we may communicate with a company that processes credit card payments and utilize services which help us verify your identity. This supplemental information may also include information we obtain from other third-party sources.
Non-Personal Information We Collect
When you do business with us or use our website, we may also collect “non-personal information,” which is information such as your age, gender, income, education, zip code. Non-personal information may also include technical information, such as the type of browser you’re using, the websites you visit before and after you visit our website, and other anonymous data involving your use of our website. Non-personal information may also include information that you provide us through your use of our website, such as the terms you enter the search functions of our website.
Social Networking and Blogs
When you post an entry on a web log (“blog”) hosted by, created by or associated with Dollarstore.com.COM or submit content to us (such as reviews, photos or videos), we may publish the information you provide. All such postings and content are subject to our Dollarstore.com.COM Community Policy.

Collected information may be used to: deliver the products and services that you have ordered; manage your account and provide you with customer support; perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others; communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or otherwise about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our affiliates or third parties; develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and on other sites; verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes; enforce our terms and conditions; and otherwise manage our business and facilitate your transactions.
Financial information

Non-personal information
We may use your non-personal information in any of the above situations, with third parties as specified below, and with advertisers and others as indicated to support our business.
Third Parties with Whom We May Share Information
Third-party Service Providers. We use third-party service providers in various aspects of our business, and we may share your personal information with them as necessary for them to perform their functions. For example, service providers may assist us with order fulfillment, package delivery, credit card issuance, the providing of warranties, credit card processing, customer service, website functionality or promotions. They may collect personal or non-personal statistics about our users, and have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. In addition, we may use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site or to present special offers to you when you visit our website. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements or offers for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. You can read more about online marketing practices and the technologies that support them by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s website.
Sharing Information with Affiliated Companies
We share customer information that we collect with our Affiliated Companies, including personal information. Our Affiliated Companies generally have privacy policies similar to ours or agree to be bound by our privacy policy before any customer information is provided to them.
Business Transfers/Transitions
As we continue to develop our business, we could buy, license or sell assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the business assets involved. In the event of a sale of our business (in whole or in part), a divestiture, merger, consolidation, restructuring, or asset sale, it is likely that one of the assets acquired by the purchaser would be the personal and non-personal information that we have collected. Under this situation, customer information would be transferred to the third-party purchaser. Business partners. When you make purchases, or engage in promotions offered through our website, by telephone, or otherwise, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a merchant’s offer or program, you authorize us to provide your e-mail address and other information to that merchant. Other Websites. We often provide links to other websites. If you choose to visit any of these sites, please understand that they have their own privacy policies and you may wish to review them. This Policy applies only to information collected by this website and by us. Other Disclosures. We may disclose personal information when we are required or requested to do so by law, court order, subpoena, legal process, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency to establish, exercise, enforce or apply our rights and agreements; defend against legal claims, or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may also share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities. With your Consent. We will share personally identifiable information with certain specific third-party marketers when you accept an offer from them or otherwise consent for us to do so. Such personally identifiable information may include your name, credit/debit card number and expiration date, physical and email addresses and other billing information, as well as other information that you consent to provide. Privacy Policies of Third Parties. Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. In addition to restrictions imposed under this Policy upon third parties use of personal information obtained from us, the third parties’ privacy policies will also govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.
How We Protect Your Personal Information
We understand the importance of securing and protecting personal information. We maintain appropriate safeguards to secure your personal information. To help protect the integrity and privacy of the personal information you provide, we use encryption technology to transmit personal information over the Internet to our servers. For example, when collecting credit card information, we offer secure-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone form intercepting and misusing it. We also use “firewalls,” secure socket layers and other security technology to protect your information and our network. We secure your personal information on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use or alteration. Our employees have limited access to your personal information based on their responsibilities and all employees are instructed to protect the confidentiality of your personal information as described in the Policy. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail. We encourage you to learn about how to prevent identify theft. Some excellent resources can be found on the websites like the site of the Federal Trade Commission, www.ftc.gov and http://onguardonline.gov/index.html. Changes to this Policy. We will update this Policy from time to time to reflect certain factors such as changes in our practices.
