Freedom Stories
We were sceptical at first, but Total Debt Freedom soon delivered as promised. Four out of five debts are now gone and we feel like we have been making real progress to our debt freedom date and given some real solid advice.

After being absent for years, a smile has finally returned to our faces. Thank-you, you are so wonderful. We are so pleased that we are debt free and can resume our life again.

Thanks for your hard work, it only took me 4 weeks to be debt free and the results were incredible. The creditors stopped calling almost immediately and I saved over $54,000. I sleep much better at night now.

It feels great knowing that I can finally go to the mailbox and actually enjoy picking up the mail not having to worry about threatening letters. I can even start answering my phone again knowing it won’t be someone on the other end asking me for money. I will always recommend TDF to anyone who is going through financial struggles.
