California Privacy rights
Privacy Notice for California Residents
This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained in Husqvarna's existing Privacy Policy located here, and applies solely to individuals who reside in the State of California ("consumers" or "you") as of January 1, 2020. We are providing this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and any terms defined in the CCPA will have the same meaning when used in this notice.
Please see our existing Privacy Policy located here to know what categories of information we collect, why we collect your information, how we collect and use your information, types of third parties with whom we share your information and why your information is shared.
Your Right to Know
You have the right to know the personal information that we have collected, disclosed, or used about you and the reasons why, for the 12-month period prior the date we receive your request. You may, at no cost, exercise Your Right to Know only twice within a 12-month period. The request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or if applicable, that a person has authority to act on your behalf.
Provide sufficient detail that allows us to understand and respond to it.
Your Right to Deletion
You have the right to ask us to delete any of your personal information that we have collected from you or retained, subject to certain exceptions. We may deny your deletion request as permitted in our existing Privacy Policy located here or as otherwise legally permitted.
Right to Know and Right to Deletion
To exercise Your Right to Know or Your Right to Deletion as described above, please contact us via one of the methods below to verify who you are and to identify what action you desire (or have your authorized agent do so on your behalf):
Complete CCPA Request Form here or
Call us at (833) 674-9153
Only you, or a person acting as an agent (once we are provided with sufficient information to confirm that you authorized that person to act on your behalf) can make a request related to your personal information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information that relates to you.
Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify your identity or the authority of your agent to make the request.
Response Time
We will acknowledge Your Right to Know or Your Right to Deletion within 10 days of receiving your request. We will strive to respond to your request with the information you want to know or the detail of the information that we have deleted, within forty-five (45) days of receipt of your initial request. If we require more time, we will explain why and the additional time needed. If we cannot comply with your request, we will explain why.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
We do not ordinarily charge a fee to process or respond to your request, but if we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Opt-Out Rights
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the consumer that is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age [upon the parent or guardian providing sufficient evidence to verify such authority]. Consumers that opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time or may have your authorized agent to do so on your behalf, by submitting the form at the link below:
CCPA Request Form here
Once you make an opt-out request, we will act upon your request within 15 days of our receipt of your request.
You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
Non-Discrimination Rights
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA. But we may offer a different price or service that is reasonably related to the value of personal information you have provided.
Changes to Our Privacy Notice
We will make changes to this policy in accordance with our existing Privacy Policy located here.
Contact Information
To exercise your rights, please contact us via one of the methods provided below:
Complete CCPA Request Form here or
Call us at (833) 674-9153
