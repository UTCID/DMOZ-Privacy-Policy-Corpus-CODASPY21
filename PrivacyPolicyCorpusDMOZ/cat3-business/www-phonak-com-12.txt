Internet sales policy
At Phonak, we believe consumers deserve the best hearing experience available today. The preferred treatment for individuals with hearing loss includes the supporting care delivered by licensed hearing care professionals. Licensed hearing care professionals have gone through rigorous training in school as well as ongoing continued education training through various professional organizations. These professionals are also trained directly by Phonak on fitting and programming the latest Phonak technology.
We believe the relationship with your hearing care professional should be personal and unique. Countless studies around the world have proven that face-to-face evaluations, selection, fitting, and follow-up care lead to much higher patient satisfaction and increased use with hearing aids. That’s why we believe the best hearing experience includes the ongoing care and expertise of the hearing care professional.
Caution for Consumers
Purchasing hearing care products via the internet or other mail-order catalogs may result in your receiving substandard fitting or follow-up care.
Please be wary of any website that offers you Phonak hearing aids without the involvement of a licensed professional. Purchasing Phonak hearing aids or accessories from any of these unauthorized online or mail-order retailers will void the warranty.
Unauthorized Retailers
Phonak reserves the right to deny supply of hearing instruments to accounts that omit the involvement of licensed professionals. Purchase of a Phonak product from an unauthorized online retailer voids the warranty.
