Welcome to Lexmark’s privacy page and thank you for your interest. Our program, Privacy@Lexmark, exists to help you understand what personal data we may collect and the steps we take to protect your privacy.  Lexmark strives to design products, services, processes, and solutions that ensure your personal data is properly handled and protected. To that end, we look to incorporate the following recognized privacy principles in everything we do:
Transparent notice and informed choice
Lawful use
Data Access
Data Integrity

Accountability for data transfers
Privacy@Lexmark is a dedicated organization whose sole purpose is to implement, promote, and maintain a corporate culture that understands and respects your right to privacy. If we can answer any questions or be of service to you in any way, please contact us as explained below.
Best regards,
Your P@L Team.
What is Personal Data?
Lexmark takes a broad view of Personal Data to best protect your privacy. Generally, the term “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person (as opposed to a company or an organization). An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to things such as a name, an identification number, an address, an employee ID, job title, or a telephone number. For example, Jane Alvarez who lives at 123 Lexmark Lane with a telephone number of 859-123-4567 is an identifiable person:  her name, address, and telephone number are all examples of her Personal Data.  Other types of Personal Data can be less obvious—such as an IP address or other types of online identifiers.

Our privacy principles
The following sections provide a more detailed explanation of our privacy principles.
Notice of Personal Data use
It is Lexmark’s intent to be fully transparent in its collection and use of Personal Data. We provide notice when collecting your Personal Data to explain the purpose for which we are collecting the data.  This notice is intended to help you make an informed choice. We use our best efforts to provide information and an explanation in a clear and convenient manner at every point we ask for your data.
We provide notice regarding the types of data we collect, how the data will be used, how the data is obtained (if it is not already clear), with whom the data may be shared, and how long it will be retained. An example may be found in our Global Preference Center. If we have not been clear or you have any question or concern, please ask.
We will not use the data for any purpose other than as provided in the notice. If you or your employer choose to have a contractual or other business relationship with Lexmark, we may contact you in connection with that business relationship when necessary.
Most of the time, you may simply choose not to provide us your Personal Data. If you choose not to provide the Personal Data we request online, you can still visit most of our web pages, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
Back to top
Lawful use
Depending on the circumstances under which we collect Personal Data, Lexmark’s use and processing of the data is based on one or more of the following:
your consent;
fulfillment of an obligation to you;
our compliance with an applicable law, regulation, or other legal obligation;
a need to protect your or another natural person’s vital interests; or,
our company`s or a third party’s legitimate interests where such interest overrides your personal interest, fundamental rights or freedoms.
Lexmark frequently reviews the purposes for which data is collected to ensure that our data collection supports reasonable business requirements.
Back to top
Data access
Your personal data belongs to you. We will provide you as much access and information as we reasonably can to update or amend the Personal Data in our care. Where applicable, we also provide a method to withdraw your consent, request a copy or transfer of your data, and even delete your Personal Data. Please keep in mind that any such request must be valid and legal and we may require additional details from you to respond appropriately. We will respond to each request in accordance with the law.
Back to top
Data integrity
Lexmark takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we process is accurate, complete and current by encouraging you to update your Personal Data as necessary.
We strive to keep your Personal Data accurately recorded. We have implemented technology, management processes, and policies to help maintain data accuracy. We provide individuals with reasonable access to review and correct their Personal Data.
Back to top
Data minimization
Lexmark’s practice is to gather the least amount of Personal Data required for the stated purpose. It is also our policy to retain any Personal Data only as long as required to meet the business need for which it is collected. Once the business need has expired, the Personal Data will be routinely deleted. In some cases, Personal Data must be retained longer than either of us may expect due to legal obligations.
Back to top
Data security
We take seriously the trust you place in us and work hard to incorporate information security into our systems, our products, and our services. We employ a global team of security professionals that sets standards and governs the enforcement of a number of corporate policies.
To protect against unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, or alteration of your Personal Data, we employ appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative measures.
Lexmark products and services are designed with privacy and security in mind using tested methodologies such as a Secure Development Lifecycle and Privacy Impact Assessments. Our devices have received worldwide recognition year after year for their robust security options and our organization has received security related certifications such as ISO 27001.

Sharing data
We keep your Personal Data confidential. We will not sell, rent, trade or lease your Personal Data to others. Unless we have your permission, we will not use or share your Personal Data in ways unrelated to the ones we describe at the time you provide the data or as described in a controlling contract. We engage service providers and suppliers (“agents”) to perform certain functions on our behalf. For example, these agents may deliver products to you, provide product service and support, maintain our information technology systems, and assist us with legitimate marketing and communication initiatives. Those agents will be permitted to process Personal Data only to perform the services specified by Lexmark. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. Any agent will have entered into written terms with Lexmark requiring that the agent abide by terms no less protective than Lexmark`s own privacy standards.
Lexmark or its affiliates could merge with or be acquired by another business, or their respective assets may be acquired. Lexmark will seek appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions

Cross-border transfers
We are a global organization with offices and customers around the world. To efficiently manage our business and best serve you, all kinds of data – not just Personal Data – may be transferred and accessed by Lexmark entities worldwide on the basis of this Privacy Notice and in alignment with international data privacy standards.   We may store, transfer, and process Personal Data in the United States and other countries where we maintain facilities.  By using our websites or services you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country
