User insight and analysis
We may analyse your activity and interactions with the Sites and Applications. We do this either as a way of helping us to improve our own Sites (as a controller), or as part of the services we provide to our clients (as a processor).
Where we process your user data as part of the services we provide to clients, this allows us to advise them on key analytics relating to their websites and apps. This helps our clients tailor projects for your benefit.
Where you have given your consent (where lawfully required), we may use cookies, log files and other technologies to collect personal information in this way. This may include the following:
An IP address to monitor traffic and volume on the Sites;
A session ID to track usage statistics on the Sites; or
Information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, participation habits, experiences with our projects and interactive features.
Our Sites and emails may contain cookies, web beacons and pixel tags (“Tags”). Tags allow us to track receipt of an email to you, to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email and collect other types of aggregate information. Once you click on an email that contains a Tag, your contact information may subsequently be cross-referenced to the source e-mail and the relevant Tag.
In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to certain websites administered by us or on our behalf. We may track click-through data to assist in determining interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of these communications.
Please see our Cookie Policy for further information.

However, our collection and use of such anonymised personal information may be subject to other laws where your consent is required. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details.
Where your personal information is not in an anonymous form, it is in our legitimate interest to use your personal information in such a way to ensure that we provide the very best services to you and our other customers.
We will only use your location data for user insight purposes where we have your consent to do so.
