2. Scope
Before using the eBay services, you must read and accept all of the terms in, and linked to, this User Agreement ("Agreement") and the eBay User Privacy Notice. We strongly recommend that, as you read this User Agreement, you also access and read the hyperlinked information. By accepting this User Agreement, you agree that this User Agreement and User Privacy Notice will apply whenever you use the eBay services, or when you use the tools we make available to interact with the eBay services. If you use an eBay site other than eBay.com.au, you acknowledge that you will need to accept and be bound by the terms of that site.
Some eBay services may have additional or other terms that we provide to you when you use those services. For example, sellers using eBay's managed payments service (described in Clause 17 below) also agree to the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab with eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd.
3. Using eBay
While using the eBay services, you will not:
post content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites and services;
infringe any laws, third party rights or our policies, such as the prohibited and restricted items policies;
use the eBay services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts, are under the age of 18 or are suspended from using the eBay services;
fail to deliver payment for items purchased by you, unless the seller has materially changed the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made or you cannot authenticate the seller's identity;
fail to deliver items purchased from you, unless the buyer fails to meet the posted terms or you cannot authenticate the buyer's identity;
manipulate the price of any item or interfere with other users' listings;
circumvent or manipulate our fee structure, the billing process, or fees owed to eBay;
post false, inaccurate, misleading, defamatory or offensive content (including personal information);
take any action that may undermine the Feedback or ratings systems (such as displaying, importing or exporting Feedback information or using it for purposes unrelated to eBay);
transfer your eBay account (including Feedback) and user ID to another party without our consent;
distribute or post spam, unsolicited or bulk electronic communications, chain letters or pyramid schemes;
distribute viruses or any other technologies that may harm eBay or the interests or property of eBay users;
export or re-export any eBay tools except in compliance with the export control laws of any relevant jurisdictions;
copy, modify or distribute rights or content from the eBay services or eBay's copyrights and trademarks; or
harvest or otherwise collect information about users, including email addresses, without their consent.
4. Abusing eBay
eBay and its community of users ("the Community") work together to keep our sites and services working properly and the Community safe. Please report problems, offensive content, and policy violations to us.
eBay's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program works to ensure that listed items do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our VeRO team and we will investigate.
Without limiting other remedies, we may limit, suspend or terminate our service and user accounts, prohibit access to the eBay services, delay or remove hosted content, remove, delete, modify or not display listings, apply fees and/or recover our expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement, and/or take technical and legal steps to keep users off the sites if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, policies related to shill bidding, conducting off-eBay transactions, Feedback manipulation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or users who we believe are harassing our employees or other users). Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our reasonable discretion, suspend or terminate accounts of users who may be repeat infringers of intellectual property rights of third parties. We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time, or to modify or discontinue eBay services.
If you are a seller and you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item.
5. Fees and services
Joining eBay and bidding on listed items is free. We do charge fees for using other services, such as listing items. The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our fee schedules:
Selling fees without an eBay Store
eBay Stores selling fees
Fees for selling a vehicle on eBay Motors
We charge different fees for selling with managed payments. When you are invited to register for managed payments, you can view these fees from the Payments tab in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab.
When you list an item or use a service that has a fee, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged.
We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions, new services, or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.
If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using some or all eBay services, even if sales terms are finalised or payment is made outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you will be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item. Sellers must meet eBay's minimum performance standards. Failure to meet these standards may result in eBay charging you additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.
Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in Australian Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with our sites and services in a timely manner with a valid payment method. If your payment method fails or your payment is past due, we (or one of our affiliates) may collect amounts owed using other collection mechanisms, including charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, using any credits on your account and, for accounts over 180 days past due, requesting that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. In the event that your payment method fails or your payment is past due, we may also limit or suspend the services which eBay provides to you, including by not displaying your listings.
6. Content
When you upload content to the eBay website or otherwise give us content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise any and all intellectual property rights (including copyright and trademark rights you have in the content, in any media known now or in the future and for any other purpose.
If you are the author of that content, you also irrevocably and unconditionally consent, to the maximum extent permitted by law (either present or future), to eBay and its licensees, contractors, assignees and successors, and their licensees and any other person authorised by any of them (“eBay Authorised Persons”):
(a) disclosing, reproducing, copying, adapting, publishing, performing, exhibiting, communicating, renting, transmitting or otherwise using the content (and any adaptation or part of the content) anywhere in the world:
(i) in whatever form and in whatever circumstances eBay and the eBay Authorised Persons think fit, including adding to or otherwise altering the content (or any adaptation or part of the content); and
(ii) without making any identification of you as the author in relation to the content (or any adaptation or part of the content); and
(b) doing anything or omitting to do anything in relation to the content (or any adaptation or part of the content) anywhere in the world that would otherwise infringe the moral rights, or any similar non-assignable, personal rights, that you might have.
For the convenience of sellers, we may offer catalogues of stock images, descriptions and product specifications that are provided by third parties (including eBay users). You may use catalogue content solely in connection with your eBay listings during the time your listings are on eBay's sites.
While we try to offer reliable data, we cannot promise that the catalogues will always be accurate and up-to-date, and you agree not to hold our catalogue content providers or us responsible for inaccuracies in catalogues. If you choose to include catalogue content in your listings, you continue to be fully responsible for your listings and for ensuring that your listings are accurate, do not include misleading information and comply with this User Agreement and all eBay policies. The catalogues may include copyrighted, trademarked or other proprietary materials. You agree not to remove any copyright, proprietary or identification markings included with the catalogues or create any derivative works based on catalogue content (other than by including them in your listings).
7. Trading on eBay and limitation of liability
While we strive to maintain a safe trading environment you accept that there are unfortunately sometimes risks when trading online and using our sites, including dealing with underage or fraudulent persons. You will not hold eBay responsible for other users' content, actions or inactions, items they list or their destruction of allegedly fake items. You acknowledge that we are not an auctioneer. Instead, our sites are venues to allow anyone to offer, sell, and buy just about anything, at any time, from anywhere, in a variety of pricing formats and locations, such as Stores, fixed price formats and auction-style formats. We are not a party to the sales transaction between buyers and sellers. We have no control over and do not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of items advertised, the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings, the ability of sellers to sell items, the ability of buyers to pay for items or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item. You should consider and use all of our suggested safe trading guidelines when trading online, including our safe trading tips for buyers and tips for sellers on avoiding transaction problems.
When you enter into a transaction you create a legally binding contract with another user, unless the item is listed in a category under the Non-binding bid policy. You must ensure that you comply with your obligations to that other member and are aware of any laws relevant to you as a buyer or seller. If another member breaches any obligation to you, you – not eBay – are responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have.
You alone, and not eBay, are responsible for ensuring that your listing, bidding and selling and any other activities conducted on our site are lawful. You must ensure that you comply with all applicable laws in Australia and other countries. You must also ensure that you strictly comply with this Agreement and the policies which form part of the Agreement.
We do not take ownership of the items at any time and do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. Further, we cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to the eBay services, and their operation may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted, we exclude all implied warranties, terms and conditions. We are not liable for any loss of money, goodwill or reputation, or any special, indirect or consequential damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of your use of or your inability to use the eBay services.
To the extent that eBay is able to limit the remedies available under this Agreement, eBay expressly limits its liability for breach of a non-excludable statutory guarantee to the following remedies:
the supply of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
8. Release
If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint venturers and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
9. Breach
Without limiting other remedies available to eBay at law, in equity or under this Agreement, we may, without notice to you and in our sole discretion (which shall be exercised reasonably, having regard to the circumstances), delay listing your item, delete your listing, issue you a warning, restrict your activities through our site (including but not limited to buying, selling and posting activities), temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your membership and refuse to provide our services to you, or require you to pay additional fees if:
you have, or we believe that you have, breached this Agreement, which includes any of our Policies in any way (including those Policies referred to in Clause 25 below);
you have, or we believe that you have, breached the conditions of the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab with eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd;
we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us;
we believe that your actions may cause loss or damage to or otherwise unlawfully harm you, our users, third parties or us, our related bodies corporate or affiliates, our directors, employees or agents; or
if we reasonably believe that any of your information (which includes an item listed on the site) is inappropriate or of an offensive nature.
For security, confidentiality and privacy reasons, we are not obligated to provide you or other members the details of any investigation that we conduct or any action which we take, in relation to your membership or your account other than those that are already provided to you by us.
10. Returns and eBay Money Back Guarantee
Buyers can request a return or report that they didn't receive an item from their Purchase history - opens in new window or tab.
If the buyer is requesting to return an item for "change of mind" (or "remorse") reasons, the seller's return policy as stated in the listing will apply – including which party is responsible for return postage costs. Sellers may exercise their discretion to accept or deny a remorse return request if it falls outside their return policy.
If an item is not received, an item differs significantly from the listing, or a seller doesn't fulfil their return policy as stated in the listing, the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy, which is part of this User Agreement and incorporated by reference, will apply. As stated in the policy, the cost of return postage for an item that is significantly not as described will usually be the seller's responsibility.
Buyers and sellers agree to comply with the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy and Condition of returned items policy and acknowledge that we may automate some aspects of the returns process. You also acknowledge and agree that we may exercise our reasonable discretion to make a final decision on any case – including an item returned for remorse reasons – where a buyer and seller cannot come to agreement. If we resolve a case in the buyer's favour, the seller will be required to issue a full refund to the buyer (including original postage costs), either by reversal of the transaction processed by eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd for managed payments transactions, by automatic reversal of the transaction from the seller's PayPal account, or by reimbursing eBay in cases where we refunded the buyer directly.
As a seller, you authorise and instruct us:
to automatically accept a return request on your behalf and provide a return postage label to the buyer, for return requests that fall within your returns policy or the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy;
to place return postage costs on your seller invoice, in cases where you are responsible for paying return postage;
to request eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd or PayPal to reverse the refund amount (in same or other currency) in cases where the transaction is cancelled or the buyer returns an item in accordance with your listing's return policy;
to request eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd or PayPal to collect or reverse variable amounts (representing payments related to covered claims) to carry out a buyer reimbursement, including amounts in other currency holdings where you do not have sufficient funds available in the transaction currency;
to request eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd or PayPal to restrict your access to funds (the restriction will apply up to a sum equivalent to the cost of the item and original postage costs paid by the buyer) at any point during the resolution process (which may result in eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd or PayPal determining to restrict your access to funds in order to manage their risk exposure pursuant to their policies – see clause 11: Restricting funds);
to recover the amount we pay to the buyer (in cases where we refund the buyer directly) by placing the reimbursement amount on your seller invoice and charging the payment method you selected; and
to use credits on your account to pay for amounts you owe to eBay.
You acknowledge and agree that your authorisations above will or may be made on a recurring basis and on various dates as required by us to facilitate returns on eBay and implement the terms of the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy.
You must have a payment method on file with eBay and you may change this payment method - opens in new window or tab at any time. If you do not provide eBay with a valid payment method, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies and instructing eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd to deduct the outstanding amount from the proceeds of sales they hold on your behalf.
We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the eBay Money Back Guarantee refund or reimbursement or instructing eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd to deduct the outstanding amount from the proceeds of sales they hold on your behalf.
As a buyer, you will be precluded from bringing an eBay Money Back Guarantee claim if you already have made or are making a claim with PayPal or have filed or are filing a chargeback with your card issuer in respect of the same transaction. We may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy, or for commercial reasons.
Certain categories of items are excluded from the eBay Money Back Guarantee, and other conditions apply. Please refer to the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy for more details.
11. Restricting funds
To protect against the risk of liability, eBay may request, and you agree to authorise the request, that PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller's PayPal account based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, returns, riskiness of the listing category or the filing of a case. This may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account in order to manage PayPal's risk exposure pursuant to PayPal policies.
In connection with managed payments as described in Clause 17, we may also request restriction of user access to funds based on the factors described in the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab.
12. Click & Collect service
Click & Collect is an eBay service that allows a person to opt to collect goods they purchase on eBay websites at either:
selected retail outlets operated by Woolworths and its related bodies corporate ("Woolworths");
selected retailers within the Parcelpoint network ("Parcelpoint"); or
selected retailers' own store locations.
You must not misrepresent the Click & Collect service as your own service (whether through direct hyperlink, advertising, promotions or any other means) or advertise or promote the Click & Collect service in a manner not approved by eBay in writing.
Sellers whose items are eligible for Click & Collect at Woolworths or Parcelpoint are subject to our Click & Collect terms of use for sellers - opens in new window or tab, which are part of this User Agreement and incorporated by reference.
Click & Collect from Woolworths
For the purposes of the Click & Collect service, Woolworths, like us, is not involved in the actual sales transaction between buyers and sellers made on eBay.com.au or other eBay websites and has no control over the acts or omissions of users of the eBay services or their agents. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by Law, Woolworths excludes any and all liability (whether in contract, tort, statute, equity or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with the eBay services, including the Click & Collect service, and including any Indirect Loss suffered paid or incurred in connection with the Click & Collect service. "Indirect Loss" means loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, loss of reputation, loss of anticipated savings, loss of opportunity, loss of use and any other loss or damage not arising naturally and according to the usual course of things from the relevant breach, act or omission whether or not such loss or damage may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the relevant breach, act or omission.
If its liability cannot be excluded by law, Woolworths' liability is limited, at its discretion and to the extent permitted by law, to the re-supply of those parts of the Click & Collect service for which it is responsible or to the payment of the cost of re-supplying those services.
eBay enters into this clause on behalf of Woolworths as its agent. You agree that Woolworths may enforce this clause directly against you in consideration of it making its retail outlets available to you in connection with the Click & Collect service.
Click & Collect at Parcelpoint
For purchases where you collect your item from a selected retailer within the Parcelpoint network, Parcelpoint's End User Terms of Service - opens in new window or tab apply in addition to the terms of this User Agreement.
Click & Collect from the retailer
For purchases where you collect your item from the retailer's own store, our Click & Collect (from the Retailer) Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab apply and are incorporated into this User Agreement by reference.
13. eBay Plus
eBay Plus is an eBay program that allows eBay customers to pay an annual membership fee and receive member-only benefits, such as free delivery and free returns on eBay Plus purchases.
eBay will display the eBay Plus badge on eligible listings based on criteria determined by eBay.
eBay Plus as a buyer
When you join eBay Plus as a buyer, you accept and agree to the eBay Plus Terms and Conditions - opens in new window or tab, which are part of this User Agreement and incorporated by reference.
eBay Plus as a seller
By using the eBay services and meeting eBay Plus criteria on one or more of your listings, you acknowledge and agree that:
You may be required to fulfil orders with express delivery at your expense;
eBay does not guarantee that the eBay Plus badge will appear on your listing, eBay's decision as to which items the eBay Plus badge is displayed on is final and eBay may include or remove sellers from eBay Plus participation at its absolute discretion;
eBay will be entitled to take necessary action against sellers who abuse the eBay Plus program or violate eBay's policies including, without limitation, recovering postage costs charged by sellers that exceed the actual postage cost for posting the item (being the amount charged by the carrier); and
You will not misrepresent the eBay Plus service as your own service (whether through direct hyperlink, advertising, promotions or any other means), nor advertise or promote the eBay Plus service in a manner not approved by eBay in writing.
If you do not wish to have any of your listings included in eBay Plus, you will be able to opt out of eBay Plus in your account preferences.
14. Access and interference
The sites contain robot exclusion headers. Much of the information on the sites is updated on a real-time basis and is proprietary or is licensed to eBay by our users or third parties. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the eBay services for any purpose without our express written permission.
Additionally, you agree that you will not:
take any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion, exercised reasonably) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute or publicly display any content (except for your information) from the sites without the prior express written permission of eBay and the appropriate third party, as applicable;
interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the sites, services or tools, or any activities conducted on or with the sites, services or tools; or
bypass our robot exclusion headers or other measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the sites.
15. Listing conditions
By listing an item on eBay's sites, you agree to pay eBay's fees for the listing, assume full responsibility for the content of the listing and item offered, and accept the following listing conditions:
When you list an item on eBay's sites, your listing will be posted on eBay's sites and can be viewed in My eBay - opens in new window or tab.
Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances), so eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations.
We may revise data in the eBay product catalogue to supplement, remove, or correct information; if your listing uses catalogue data that has been revised, those revisions may modify your listing accordingly.
Where your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors including listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and postage cost, Feedback and detailed seller ratings. Learn more about where your listings appear in search and browse results.
Your listing will, at all times, comply with eBay rules and policies, including listing rules.
You must list your item in the most relevant category. When you list an item in two categories and there is a difference in final value fees between the categories, the higher final value fee will apply when your item sells.
16. Buying and selling internationally
Sellers can offer items for sale internationally by listing directly on one or more of eBay's international sites, or by choosing to offer international postage option(s) when listing on eBay.com.au. Buyers may purchase items from international sellers that are displayed on eBay.com.au, or by shopping on one or more of eBay's international sites.
Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase and shipment of items, as detailed in the International trading policy.
If you list an item for sale or purchase an item on an eBay site other than eBay.com.au, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with respect to that particular listing or purchase, including any buyer protection programs, as detailed in the International selling policy.
As a seller, regardless of which eBay site you use to list your item:
If you choose to offer an international postage option (such as worldwide postage), you agree that we may display your listing on an eBay site other than the eBay site where you listed your item for sale based on your postage settings, but acknowledge that your listings may not appear on some or all of these sites. You may stop your listing from appearing on international sites or restrict international buyers from purchasing your items by adjusting your postage settings, as detailed in the International selling policy.
If your item is sold to a buyer who is using an eBay site other than your eBay site of registration, you agree to be subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies, including any buyer protection programs, of that other site with respect to that particular sale, as detailed in the International selling policy.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the sale and delivery of items to international buyers and are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes or charges associated with eBay sites and services such as GST or VAT. Fees for listing and selling items on eBay's international sites will be added to your seller invoice and charged to the automatic payment method (if any) that is on file with your eBay site of registration.
As part of eBay Services, we may offer certain programs, tools and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international postage calculation tools.
You authorise us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content and member-to-member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy or availability of any translation is not guaranteed.
17. Managed payments
eBay has launched a new managed payments service, where eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd (the "payments entity") manages payments on behalf of sellers (such management described as "managed payments" or similar) on eBay.com.au.
The contract for sale underlying the purchase of goods is directly concluded between seller and the buyer in the same manner as for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments.
Using eBay's managed payment service as a seller
When we activate your account for managed payments, to continue to list and sell on eBay, as directed by eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd, you must:
provide the payments entity with information about you and/or your business to meet its compliance requirements, including those involving identity verification, anti-money laundering controls, and sanctions screening as required by applicable laws and policies; and
pass such verification and screening and otherwise meet the compliance requirements of the payments entity, as determined by the payments entity; and
provide bank account information so that the payments entity can link such account to your eBay account, allowing the payments entity to pay you.
In addition:
the payments entity may obtain information about you from third parties to verify your identity, comply with anti-money laundering and sanctions screening obligations, and for other purposes in connection with managed payments; and
the payments entity may use third-party payments service providers to assist it in providing managed payments services, including companies that process payments, perform risk assessments (such as credit agencies) or compliance checks, verify identity, and validate payment methods. eBay, the payments entity, and their affiliates may send personal data associated with you and your account to such third parties.
The payments entity may, in its sole discretion, manage payments on your behalf even if you haven't provided all requested information, and the payments entity may withhold payouts pending receipt of such information.
The complete terms governing sellers' use of managed payments are available in the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab, incorporated herein. You agree to the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab to the extent applicable to you.
Using eBay's managed payment service as a buyer
As a buyer, you understand that for some orders, you will be transacting with a seller who is using managed payments. By purchasing items on eBay.com.au, you acknowledge and agree that in the case of a managed payments transaction:
You may pay for such items using those payment methods that eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd makes available, and eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd will manage settlement to sellers. You authorise eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd to initiate payments using your selected payment method and collect the transaction amounts on behalf of sellers.
In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, AML compliance, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with eBay's internal risk controls or due to potential violations of any policy of eBay or eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd, or a policy of eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd's third party payments services providers.
eBay, eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers and card expiry dates, entered by you on eBay Services when you make a purchase, redeem a voucher, or make any other transaction on eBay Services where card information is entered. Such stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for future transactions on eBay Services. At any time, you can update your card information or enter new card information, at which point the new card information shall be stored as your default payment method. You may make changes to your default payment method through the Personal Information section under the Account tab in My eBay - opens in new window or tab. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to eBay updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers. You will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorised to use.
You may seek returns or cancellations, or file eBay Money Back Guarantee claims, in the same manner as you do for transactions for which eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd does not manage payments. eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd refunds amounts paid for successful eBay Money Back Guarantee claims and returned or cancelled transactions in cases where the original payment was handled by such entity. Refund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks.
You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use of managed payments. You understand that some third parties, such as credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you choose to use in connection with managed payments transactions. Failure to abide by third party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that eBay Commerce Australia Pty Ltd has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions.
18. Tax on consumer purchases
Buyers and sellers are generally responsible for any Goods and Services Tax (GST), sales tax, or other taxes that apply to items bought on eBay. If you have any questions or require more information about your tax obligations, please contact the Australian Taxation Office - opens in new window or tab, your local tax or customs authority, or seek independent tax advice.
In any jurisdiction where eBay has an obligation to collect tax on consumer purchases:
eBay may add the applicable tax to the item price displayed to the buyer;
eBay will display the tax amount at checkout once the buyer's order and delivery address are confirmed, and this will be included in the order total paid by the buyer;
eBay will collect this amount via any means available to us and remit the tax to the relevant authority.
For more details, please see our Tax policy.
As a buyer, you acknowledge and agree that tax may apply on top of the seller's item price, and that you will have the opportunity to review this before finalising your order.
As a seller, you acknowledge and agree that where eBay has an obligation to collect tax on consumer purchases 1) your prices may appear higher to buyers based on their delivery address, and 2) that we may not report tax collected to you, although we will indicate on the order details page if tax was collected by eBay.

paying any outstanding fees owing on the account.

4. Abusing eBay
eBay and its community of users ("the Community") work together to keep our sites and services working properly and the Community safe. Please report problems, offensive content, and policy violations to us.
eBay's Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program works to ensure that listed items do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties.

Without limiting other remedies, we may limit, suspend or terminate our service and user accounts, prohibit access to the eBay services, delay or remove hosted content, remove, delete, modify or not display listings, apply fees and/or recover our expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement, and/or take technical and legal steps to keep users off the sites if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, policies related to shill bidding, conducting off-eBay transactions, Feedback manipulation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or users who we believe are harassing our employees or other users). Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our reasonable discretion, suspend or terminate accounts of users who may be repeat infringers of intellectual property rights of third parties. We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time, or to modify or discontinue eBay services.
If you are a seller and you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item.
5. Fees and services
Joining eBay and bidding on listed items is free. We do charge fees for using other services, such as listing items. The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our fee schedules:
Selling fees without an eBay Store
eBay Stores selling fees
Fees for selling a vehicle on eBay Motors
When you list an item or use a service that has a fee, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged.
We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions, new services, or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.
If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using some or all eBay services, even if sales terms are finalised or payment is made outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you will be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item. Sellers must meet eBay's minimum performance standards. Failure to meet these standards may result in eBay charging you additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.
Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in Australian Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with our sites and services in a timely manner with a valid payment method. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts owed using other collection mechanisms, including charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, using any credits on your account and, for accounts over 180 days past due, requesting that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. In the event that your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may also limit or suspend the services which eBay provides to you, including by not displaying your listings.
6. Content
When you upload content to the eBay website or otherwise give us content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise any and all intellectual property rights (including copyright and trademark rights you have in the content, in any media known now or in the future and for any other purpose.
If you are the author of that content, you also irrevocably and unconditionally consent, to the maximum extent permitted by law (either present or future), to eBay and its licensees, contractors, assignees and successors, and their licensees and any other person authorised by any of them (“eBay Authorised Persons”):
(a) disclosing, reproducing, copying, adapting, publishing, performing, exhibiting, communicating, renting, transmitting or otherwise using the content (and any adaptation or part of the content) anywhere in the world:
(i) in whatever form and in whatever circumstances eBay and the eBay Authorised Persons think fit, including adding to or otherwise altering the content (or any adaptation or part of the content); and
(ii) without making any identification of you as the author in relation to the content (or any adaptation or part of the content); and
(b) doing anything or omitting to do anything in relation to the content (or any adaptation or part of the content) anywhere in the world that would otherwise infringe the moral rights, or any similar non-assignable, personal rights, that you might have.
For the convenience of sellers, we may offer catalogues of stock images, descriptions and product specifications that are provided by third parties (including eBay users). You may use catalogue content solely in connection with your eBay listings during the time your listings are on eBay's sites.
While we try to offer reliable data, we cannot promise that the catalogues will always be accurate and up-to-date, and you agree not to hold our catalogue content providers or us responsible for inaccuracies in catalogues. If you choose to include catalogue content in your listings, you continue to be fully responsible for your listings and for ensuring that your listings are accurate, do not include misleading information and comply with this User Agreement and all eBay policies. The catalogues may include copyrighted, trademarked or other proprietary materials. You agree not to remove any copyright, proprietary or identification markings included with the catalogues or create any derivative works based on catalogue content (other than by including them in your listings).
7. Trading on eBay and limitation of liability
While we strive to maintain a safe trading environment you accept that there are unfortunately sometimes risks when trading online and using our sites, including dealing with underage or fraudulent persons. You will not hold eBay responsible for other users' content, actions or inactions, items they list or their destruction of allegedly fake items. You acknowledge that we are not an auctioneer. Instead, our sites are venues to allow anyone to offer, sell, and buy just about anything, at any time, from anywhere, in a variety of pricing formats and locations, such as Stores, fixed price formats and auction-style formats. We are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. We have no control over and do not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of items advertised, the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings, the ability of sellers to sell items, the ability of buyers to pay for items or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item. You should consider and use all of our suggested safe trading guidelines when trading online, including our safe trading tips for buyers and tips for sellers on avoiding transaction problems.
When you enter into a transaction you create a legally binding contract with another user, unless the item is listed in a category under the Non-binding bid policy. You must ensure that you comply with your obligations to that other member and are aware of any laws relevant to you as a buyer or seller. If another member breaches any obligation to you, you – not eBay – are responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have.
You alone, and not eBay, are responsible for ensuring that your listing, bidding and selling and any other activities conducted on our site are lawful. You must ensure that you comply with all applicable laws in Australia and other countries. You must also ensure that you strictly comply with this Agreement and the policies which form part of the Agreement.
We do not take ownership of the items at any time and do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. Further, we cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to the eBay services, and their operation may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted, we exclude all implied warranties, terms and conditions. We are not liable for any loss of money, goodwill or reputation, or any special, indirect or consequential damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of your use of or your inability to use the eBay services.
To the extent that eBay is able to limit the remedies available under this Agreement, eBay expressly limits its liability for breach of a non-excludable statutory guarantee to the following remedies:
the supply of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
8. Release
If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint venturers and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
9. Breach
Without limiting other remedies available to eBay at law, in equity or under this Agreement, we may, without notice to you and in our sole discretion (which shall be exercised reasonably, having regard to the circumstances), delay listing your item, delete your listing, issue you a warning, restrict your activities through our site (including but not limited to buying, selling and posting activities), temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your membership and refuse to provide our services to you, or require you to pay additional fees if:
you have, or we believe that you have, breached this Agreement, which includes any of our Policies in any way (including those Policies referred to in Clause 24 below);
we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us;
we believe that your actions may cause loss or damage to or otherwise unlawfully harm you, our users, third parties or us, our related bodies corporate or affiliates, our directors, employees or agents; or
if we reasonably believe that any of your information (which includes an item listed on the site) is inappropriate or of an offensive nature.
For security, confidentiality and privacy reasons, we are not obligated to provide you or other members the details of any investigation that we conduct or any action which we take, in relation to your membership or your account other than those that are already provided to you by us.
10. Returns and eBay Money Back Guarantee
Buyers can request a return or report that they didn't receive an item from their Purchase history - opens in new window or tab.
If the buyer is requesting to return an item for "change of mind" (or "remorse") reasons, the seller's return policy as stated in the listing will apply – including which party is responsible for return postage costs. Sellers may exercise their discretion to accept or deny a remorse return request if it falls outside their return policy.
If an item is not received or differs significantly from the listing, the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy, which is part of this User Agreement and incorporated by reference, will apply. As stated in the policy, the cost of return postage for an item that is significantly not as described will usually be the seller's responsibility.
Buyers and sellers agree to comply with the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy and Condition of returned items policy and acknowledge that we may automate some aspects of the returns process. You also acknowledge and agree that we may exercise our reasonable discretion to make a final decision on any case – including an item returned for remorse reasons – where a buyer and seller cannot come to agreement. If we resolve a case in the buyer's favour, the seller will be required to issue a full refund to the buyer (including original postage costs), either by automatic reversal of the transaction from the seller's PayPal account, or by reimbursing eBay in cases where we refunded the buyer directly.
As a seller, you authorise and instruct us:
to automatically accept a return request on a your behalf and provide a return postage label to the buyer, for return requests that fall within your returns policy or the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy;
to place return postage costs on your seller invoice, in cases where you are responsible for paying return postage;
to request PayPal to reverse the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account in cases where the transaction is cancelled or the buyer returns an item in accordance with your listing's return policy;
to request PayPal to collect or reverse variable amounts (representing payments related to covered claims) from your PayPal account to carry out a buyer reimbursement, including amounts in other currency holdings where you do not have sufficient funds available in the transaction currency;
to request PayPal to restrict your access to funds (the restriction will apply up to a sum equivalent to the cost of the item and original postage costs paid by the buyer) in your PayPal account at any point during the resolution process (which may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account in order to manage PayPal's risk exposure pursuant to PayPal policies – see clause 11: Restricting funds);
to recover the amount we pay to the buyer (in cases where we refund the buyer directly) by placing the reimbursement amount on your seller invoice and charging the payment method you selected; and
to use credits on your account to pay for amounts you owe to eBay.
You acknowledge and agree that your authorisations above will or may be made on a recurring basis and on various dates as required by us to facilitate returns on eBay and implement the terms of the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy.
You must have a payment method on file with eBay and you may change this payment method - opens in new window or tab at any time. If you do not provide eBay with a valid payment method, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.
We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the eBay Money Back Guarantee refund or reimbursement.
As a buyer, you will be precluded from bringing an eBay Money Back Guarantee claim if you already have made or are making a claim with PayPal in respect of the same transaction. We may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy, or for commercial reasons.
Certain categories of items are excluded from the eBay Money Back Guarantee, and other conditions apply. Please refer to the eBay Money Back Guarantee policy for more details.
11. Restricting funds
To protect against the risk of liability, eBay may request, and you agree to authorise the request, that PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller's PayPal account based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance, returns, riskiness of the listing category or the filing of a case. This may result in PayPal determining to restrict funds in your PayPal account in order to manage PayPal's risk exposure pursuant to PayPal policies.
12. Click & Collect service
Click & Collect is an eBay service that allows a person to opt to collect goods they purchase on eBay websites at either:
selected retail outlets operated by Woolworths and its related bodies corporate ("Woolworths");
selected retailers within the Parcelpoint network ("Parcelpoint"); or
selected retailers' own store locations.
You must not misrepresent the Click & Collect service as your own service (whether through direct hyperlink, advertising, promotions or any other means) or advertise or promote the Click & Collect service in a manner not approved by eBay in writing.
Sellers whose items are eligible for Click & Collect at Woolworths or Parcelpoint are subject to our Click & Collect terms of use for sellers - opens in new window or tab, which are part of this User Agreement and incorporated by reference.
Click & Collect from Woolworths
For the purposes of the Click & Collect service, Woolworths, like us, is not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers made on eBay.com.au or other eBay websites and has no control over the acts or omissions of users of the eBay services or their agents. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by Law, Woolworths excludes any and all liability (whether in contract, tort, statute, equity or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with the eBay services, including the Click & Collect service, and including any Indirect Loss suffered paid or incurred in connection with the Click & Collect service. "Indirect Loss" means loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, loss of reputation, loss of anticipated savings, loss of opportunity, loss of use and any other loss or damage not arising naturally and according to the usual course of things from the relevant breach, act or omission whether or not such loss or damage may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the relevant breach, act or omission.
If its liability cannot be excluded by law, Woolworths' liability is limited, at its discretion and to the extent permitted by law, to the re-supply of those parts of the Click & Collect service for which it is responsible or to the payment of the cost of re-supplying those services.
eBay enters into this clause on behalf of Woolworths as its agent. You agree that Woolworths may enforce this clause directly against you in consideration of it making its retail outlets available to you in connection with the Click & Collect service.
Click & Collect at Parcelpoint
For purchases where you collect your item from a selected retailer within the Parcelpoint network, Parcelpoint's End User Terms of Service - opens in new window or tab apply in addition to the terms of this User Agreement.
Click & Collect from the retailer
For purchases where you collect your item from the retailer's own store, our Click & Collect (from the Retailer) Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab apply and are incorporated into this User Agreement by reference.

eBay will be entitled to take necessary action against sellers who abuse the eBay Plus program or violate eBay's policies including, without limitation, recovering postage costs charged by sellers that exceed the actual postage cost for posting the item (being the amount charged by the carrier); and
You will not misrepresent the eBay Plus service as your own service (whether through direct hyperlink, advertising, promotions or any other means), nor advertise or promote the eBay Plus service in a manner not approved by eBay in writing.
If you do not wish to have any of your listings included in eBay Plus, you will be able to opt out of eBay Plus in your account preferences.
14. Access and interference
The sites contain robot exclusion headers. Much of the information on the sites is updated on a real-time basis and is proprietary or is licensed to eBay by our users or third parties. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the eBay services for any purpose without our express written permission.
Additionally, you agree that you will not:
take any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion, exercised reasonably) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute or publicly display any content (except for your information) from the sites without the prior express written permission of eBay and the appropriate third party, as applicable;
interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the sites, services or tools, or any activities conducted on or with the sites, services or tools; or
bypass our robot exclusion headers or other measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the sites.
15. Listing conditions
By listing an item on eBay's sites, you agree to pay eBay's fees for the listing, assume full responsibility for the content of the listing and item offered, and accept the following listing conditions:
When you list an item on eBay's sites, your listing will be posted on eBay's sites and can be viewed in My eBay - opens in new window or tab.
Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances), so eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations.
We may revise data in the eBay product catalogue to supplement, remove, or correct information; if your listing uses catalogue data that has been revised, those revisions may modify your listing accordingly.
Where your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors including listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and postage cost, Feedback and detailed seller ratings. Learn more about where your listings appear in search and browse results.
Your listing will, at all times, comply with eBay rules and policies, including listing rules.
You must list your item in the most relevant category. When you list an item in two categories and there is a difference in final value fees between the categories, the higher final value fee will apply when your item sells.
16. Selling internationally
You may be able to sell your items internationally by listing items for sale directly on one or more of eBay's international sites or where you choose to list items with an international postage option. You agree that we may display your listing on an eBay site other than the eBay site where you listed your item for sale, including those situations where you choose to list items with an international postage option (such as worldwide postage). However, you may restrict international buyers from purchasing your items if you explicitly exclude international postage locations from your listings or by creating and applying an exclusion list to your listings.
Regardless of which eBay site you use to list your item, if your item is sold to a buyer who is using an eBay site other than your eBay site of registration, you agree to be subject to that other site's User Agreement and policies with respect to that particular purchase, including that site's eBay Money Back Guarantee policy.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the sale and delivery of items to international buyers and are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes or charges associated with eBay sites and services such as GST or VAT. Fees for listing and selling items on eBay's international sites will be added to your seller invoice and charged to the automatic payment method (if any) that is on file with your eBay site of registration.
17. Tax on consumer purchases
Buyers and sellers are generally responsible for any Goods and Services Tax (GST), sales tax, or other taxes that apply to items bought on eBay. If you have any questions or require more information about your tax obligations, please contact the Australian Taxation Office - opens in new window or tab, your local tax or customs authority, or seek independent tax advice.
In any jurisdiction where eBay has an obligation to collect tax on consumer purchases:
eBay may add the applicable tax to the item price displayed to the buyer;
eBay will display the tax amount at checkout once the buyer's order and delivery address are confirmed, and this will be included in the order total paid by the buyer;
eBay will collect this amount via any means available to us and remit the tax to the relevant authority.
For more details, please see our Tax policy.
As a buyer, you acknowledge and agree that tax may apply on top of the seller's item price, and that you will have the opportunity to review this before finalising your order.
As a seller, you acknowledge and agree that where eBay has an obligation to collect tax on consumer purchases 1) your prices may appear higher to buyers based on their delivery address, and 2) that we may not report tax collected to you, although we will indicate on the order details page if tax was collected by eBay.
18. Closing your account
You may close your eBay account at any time, subject to:
not having any outstanding items listed on the website; and
resolving any outstanding matters (such as a suspension or restriction on your account); and
paying any outstanding fees owing on the account.
19. Privacy
