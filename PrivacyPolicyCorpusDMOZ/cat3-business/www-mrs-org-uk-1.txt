MRS represents both large businesses and SMEs and we have a range of research suppliers included in our membership. We support best practice in the research industry by setting and enforcing industry standards.

name;
image and/or voice captured through photography, filming, videotaping and/or audio recording;
demographic data such as your date of birth, gender, educational background; job title; professional memberships; country;
contact data such as email address; home and/or work postal address, postcode; phone number;
payment data such as payment instruments (e.g. credit card numbers) and the associated security code or other financial details(where you make a payment to Us);
information from queries and/or complaints registered with Us;
information about the way you use Our Website, so that We can improve the effectiveness of Our business (see our Cookies Policy for more information);
any other information which may be collected in the course of Our interactions with you.
Please note that sometimes we will require you to provide additional personal information, and sometime sensitive personal information, such as disability and health requirements if this is necessary to provide you with a service or product.
How do we collect information about you?
We collect information about you:
when you register for a web account with Us;
request product or services;
become a member;
participate in promotions;
attend events;
take qualifications;
enter competitions;
provide Us with your personal information from your usage of Our website and any other information you post on Our website, e-mail or otherwise send to Us;
or otherwise provide Us with information in the course of Our interactions with you.
Persons under 16 should not disclose to us any personal information without first getting the permission of a parent or a guardian.
How do we use this information?
We use your personal information:
to enable Us to supply you with the goods and services and information which you have requested;
to analyse the information We collect so that We can administer, support and improve and develop Our business and services We offer;
to predict what you might be interested in;
to provide you with access to certain parts of Our website;
for all other purposes consistent with the proper performance of Our operations and business; and
to contact you for your views on Our products and services.
We may also email you about information or activities that We think you might be interested in. If you do not want us to send you updates like this, please contact us at Market Research Society, 15 Northburgh Street, London EC1V 0JR or by email at info@mrs.org.uk.
What are the legal bases we use for processing your information?
The GDPR requires Us to rely on one or more lawful bases to use your personal information. We consider the bases listed below to be relevant:
Where you have provided your consent for us to use your personal information in a certain way (for example, we will ask for your consent to send you marketing material by email, and we may ask for your explicit consent to collect special categories of your personal information).
Where necessary so that we can comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, where we are obliged to share your personal information with regulatory bodies which govern our work and services).
Where necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract (for example, to administer your membership or allow you to participate in an event for which you have registered).
Where there is a legitimate interest in us doing so if it is reasonably necessary to achieve our or others’ legitimate interests (as long as that processing is fair, balanced and does not unduly impact your rights).
“Legitimate Interests” means Our interests in conducting and managing our business as the professional body for research, insight and analytics and as the regulator promoting high professional standards throughout the sector.  For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to your interests. As we are a professional awarding body we have an interest in making available and publishing successful candidate results such as in print and digital channels of Impact Magazine. We also have an interest in processing your information, to undertake research for MRS or on behalf of third parties, in order to inform our knowledge base and assist our representation of the sector. Our interests also allow us to communicate with you to ensure that you can participate in the governance of the society we will process your information to send you communications about the Annual General Meeting and election notices and to co-operate on charitable activities for the sector through the Market Research Benevolent Association (MRBA) and the Archive of Market and Social Research (AMSR).
It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well. For example, we may process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure or
When we process your personal information for Our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection legislation. Our legitimate interests do not automatically override your interests - we will not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
If you have any concerns about Our processing, you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more information on your rights, please see Section 12 on “Your Rights” below.
Will we ever share your information?
We may use selected agents to process your information on Our behalf, such as software providers to host Our website.  Such third parties will be authorised to see and use your information but only to fulfil their contractual obligations to Us and will not be permitted to use it for any other purpose.  We retain full responsibility for how your personal information may be used by such agents.
In exceptional circumstances We may share your information when We are legally required to do so.
When requested by you, We may pass on your personal information to third parties who may send you details of goods and services that may be of interest to you.  For example, if you attend an event, your details may be shared with the speakers, trainers and/or sponsors at the event.  If this is of interest to you, please tick the box on the relevant registration form, opting in for such contact.  If at any time you would prefer not to receive this information, please contact Us at Market Research Society, 15 Northburgh Street, London EC1V 0JR or by email at info@mrs.org.uk.
How do we protect your personal information?
We place great importance on the security of your personal information and We always try to take appropriate precautions to protect it. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help Us protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. For example when we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.
Despite all of Our precautions however, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  So, whilst We strive to protect your personal information, We cannot guarantee the security of any information which you send to Us and you must understand that you do so at your own risk.
How long do We keep your personal information for?
The length of time We hold your personal information varies depending upon the type of information and its use.  We will hold your personal information on Our systems only for as long as necessary to provide the services and/or products that you have requested, or for such other essential purposes such as investigating disciplinary matters, complying with  our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
The actual retention periods for different types of personal information that we hold can be found here  If you have any questions about Our data retention policy, please email: info@mrs.org.uk
Where do we store and process your information?
We generally store and process your information within the European Economic Area (EEA).
Where we need to transfer your information outside of the European Economic Area we only do so to countries which have been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection//or where We transfer personal information to countries that have not been determined to have an adequate level of protection we do so using a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections.
What are your rights?

They can be contacted via their websitehttps://ico.org.uk/concerns/ or by telephone 0303 123 1113.
