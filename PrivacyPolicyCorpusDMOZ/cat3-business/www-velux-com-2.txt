Privacy policy
Privacy policy
The VELUX Group respects and protects your privacy. In the following, you can read about how we handle your personal data.
This VELUX Privacy Policy (‘VELUX Privacy Policy’) describes the treatment of data provided on or collected at our digital platforms, which gives a visitor the possibility to access our online presence and use our services. This VELUX Privacy Policy complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (‘GDPR’) and the Danish Law.
Our parent company is VELUX A/S registered in Denmark under registration number 30003519 with its registered office at Aadalsvej 99, 2970 Hoersholm, Denmark.
Lawful basis for our data processing
When we process personal data in relation to a contract or a potential contract with you, the lawful basis for the processing is that it is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. If the lawful basis for processing is consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent as mentioned hereafter at any time, but this does not affect the legitimacy of the processing by VELUX A/S prior to your withdrawal of consent. If we share your personal data with law enforcement agencies or other governmental bodies, we share this because we have a legal obligation to do so.
Our reason and purpose for collecting personal data
The following are the main categories of data collected by VELUX A/S and the main purposes for collecting the personal data:
2.1 As part of general VELUX business operations
We collect personal data about individuals, customers, suppliers (including third party service providers) and other stakeholders. The data may include an individual’s name, contact details and other information necessary for conducting business with you or your organisation.
2.2 To assist with queries
You may choose to provide us with personal data including your name, e-mail address or other contact details when you contact us by telephone, e-mail, post, our chatbot or by using our digital platforms. This personal data enables us to respond to requests for information on such matters as VELUX products, to arrange a measure and quote for installation of VELUX products, or to arrange for a window to be serviced, or to present claims under the VELUX guarantee. The information may be disclosed to VELUX A/S or other VELUX sales companies, relevant independent installers or dealers in order for us to assist customers with their enquiry or arrange for services or a quote.
2.3 Customers and prospective customers
We may collect personal data of customers and prospective customers, including name, contact details, payment and credit card details, credit information and other information necessary for us to conduct business with the person or organisation. We may disclose the information to dealers or independent installers and logistic partners to process a customer’s order, including arranging delivery of VELUX products to the customer or assisting with enquiries.
2.4 Business development
The personal data you provide to us and personal data collected at our digital platforms will be used to enhance our consumer insight and drive relevant communication and offers across all touch points you may have with VELUX A/S. Personal data will also be used for product and service development.
2.5 Marketing
Based on your consent, we process your personal data for the purpose of informing you of VELUX business operations, products and services.
For the above purposes, we create marketing, tailored to your preferences and profile which will be based on your contact information, browsing history, sales and subscription service information; such as name, address, e-mail, phone number, purchase history, unique identifiers such as cookieIDs or deviceIDs and tracked browsing history based on these IDs. Please be aware that this list is not exhaustive as we may use any personal information collected in connection with your interactions with VELUX A/S and its websites, mobile applications, products and services.
If you do not wish to receive any further information, you can easily and free of charge unsubscribe from our marketing communication anytime. You will find ways to unsubscribe in connection with subscribing to or receiving marketing communication from us. You can also contact us by email or post to unsubscribe, see section 8. If you unsubscribe from receiving marketing communication, we will delete your personal data within two months, unless we process your personal data for other purposes within section 2.1-2.8
2.6 Visitor and customer surveys
To develop our products and services, we may collect personal data from digital platform visitors or customers as part of surveys. We will only process personal data as part of surveys if you have provided a consent. Likewise, personal data obtained through surveys will only be used for marketing purposes with your consent.
2.7 Prospective employees and contractors
When a person applies for a job or enters into a contract with us, we may collect certain information such as name, contact details, information about working history, educational diplomas, relevant record checks and information about professional interests. This may be collected from the person directly, from a recruitment consultant and from the person’s previous employers and others, including references and publicly available sources. This information is used to inform or assist us in the decision as to whether to make the person an offer of employment or engage the person under a contract.
2.8 To comply with the law
We may collect personal data as required or permitted by the law. Personal as well as non-personal data collected by us is considered confidential and will never be sold or leased to third parties, besides the exceptions mentioned in section 2 and 4.
How we collect your personal data
We collect personal data, you provide to us, when you request products, services or information from us, register with us, participate in public forums, use a chatbot or other activities on our digital platforms, respond to customer surveys, or otherwise interact with us.
