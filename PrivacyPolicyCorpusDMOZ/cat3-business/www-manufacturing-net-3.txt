General Assembly.As the pandemic washed over the world and made shipping crews unwelcome in many ports, he said, “We received very limited information, and it became increasingly difficult to get vital supplies and technical support. Nations changed regulations on a daily, if not hourly, basis.”Several months later, many borders remain closed and flights are rare, complicating efforts to bring in replacement crews for those stuck at sea and forcing their employers to keep extending their contracts.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres joined shipping companies, trade unions and maritime organizations in urging governments to recognize merchant crews as essential workers and allow them to travel more freely. With more than 80% of global trade by volume transported by sea, the world’s 2 million merchant seafarers play a vital role.Merchant ship crews are used to long stretches away from home, but as virus infections and restrictions spread early this year, anxiety mounted along with the uncertainty, Marzougui said.“Not knowing when or if we would be returning home put severe mental strain on my crew and myself," he said. "We felt like second-class citizens with no input or control over our lives."The Tunisian-born captain spent an extra three months at sea and finally made it home to his family in Florida in late May. But more than 300,000 mariners are still stranded, waiting for replacement crews; about as many are waiting on shore, trying to get back to work.Maritime officials from Panama, the Philippines, Canada, France and Kenya defended steps they have taken individually to allow safe crew changes or otherwise ease the crisis.But officials lamented a lack of international coordination among nations and shipping companies, calling for new rules to protect countries from the virus while respecting the rights of stranded crews.No figures were released for how many merchant mariners have contracted the virus, but Guy Platten of the International Chamber of Shipping said the virus risk is “relatively low" because shipping companies have strict protection measures and “have no wish whatsoever to bring infections on our ships.”He blamed “red tape and bureaucracy" for crew change delays and said border guards and local port officials in some countries are being overzealous in blocking them from coming ashore. One way goods are still able to get ashore despite restrictions is by dock workers fetching them from the ships.France proposed compiling a global U.N. list of ports that can be secured to accommodate crew changes. Kenya called for sharing costs globally for a rapid testing plan for major ports.Crews often work 12-hour shifts with no weekends, and Marzougui warned that extending stints without a break risks physical and mental strain — potentially putting ships and oceans in danger.The captain compared it to telling a marathon runner at the end of the race that they had to “do it again, right away, with no rest.”LatestOklahoma Asks Court: Make J&J Pay $9.3B to End Opioid CrisisDec 10th, 2020Company Offering Pandemic Stock Tips Accused of $137M FraudDec 8th, 2020Years of Research Laid Groundwork for Speedy COVID-19 ShotsDec 8th, 2020Biden, Top Democrats Swing Behind Bipartisan Virus Aid BillDec 3rd, 2020MoreHomeHewlett Packard Enterprise to Move HeadquartersOne of the first companies in Silicon Valley, HPE's exit is a symbolic loss for Northern California.Dec 3rd, 2020HomeVirgin Galactic Gets NASA ContractThe partnership will support NASA's Flight Opportunity program.Dec 2nd, 2020HomeUK Authorizes Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine for Emergency UseThe company's shot is the first to be backed up by rigorous scientific review.Dec 2nd, 2020HomeChina Spacecraft Collects Moon Samples to Take Back to EarthThe lander will spend two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 4.4 pounds of rocks and debris.Dec 2nd, 2020OperationsMicrosoft’s HoloLens Becomes Critical Tool for Machine OwnersThis used to be the stuff of science fiction movies, but now it's woven into our daily lives.Dec 1st, 2020EnergySan Francisco Public Utilities Chief Charged with CorruptionHe allegedly accepted meals, cash and other gifts from a construction company in exchange for insider information on city contracts.Dec 1st, 2020HomeTony Hsieh, Retired Zappos CEO, Dies at 46 After House FireHsieh spent years working to transform Las Vegas's downtown area.Nov 30th, 2020HomeUS Agency Investigating Tesla Suspension FailuresLinkages near the ball joints can fail, allowing contact between the tire and wheel liner.Nov 27th, 2020HomeAstraZeneca Manufacturing Error Clouds Vaccine Study ResultsIn a surprise, the group of volunteers that got a lower dose seemed to be much better protected than the volunteers who got two full doses.Nov 27th, 2020HomeWith Wipe and Mask Demand High, Fiber Maker Sets GrowthThe Thai chemical company subsidiary will spend $48 million to expand production.Nov 25th, 2020HomeUS-European Ocean Monitoring Satellite Launches into OrbitThe satellite’s extremely accurate radar altimeter will bounce energy off the sea surface as it sweeps over Earth’s oceans.Nov 23rd, 2020HomeFDA Allows Emergency Use of Antibody Drug Trump ReceivedEarly results suggest the drug may reduce COVID-19-related hospitalization in high-risk patients.Nov 23rd, 2020Follow UsFacebook iconTwitter iconYouTube iconLinkedIn iconMost RecentElon Musk Ditches 'Entitled' CaliforniaReport: Biden to Pick Katherine Tai as Top Trade EnvoyOklahoma Asks Court: Make J&J Pay $9.3B to End Opioid CrisisGovernor Was Warned of Would-be Regulator's Ties to Utility3 Ways to Enhance MRO Systems Integration
