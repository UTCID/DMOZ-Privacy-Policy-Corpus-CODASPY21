NON-PERSONAL DATA
Non-Personal Data (“NPD”): NPD is information that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you. Such information may include browser information, domain names, and other anonymous or anonymized statistical data related to use of the
Site.
The Site collects NPD to monitor user traffic patterns and Site usage. We may link some of this NPD to Personal Data for purposes such as personalizing and improving your experience on the Site and for general Site evaluation. More
specifically, browser information is collected when you are using the Site through log files and third-party scripts that automatically collect information that may include, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, number of
clicks, date/time stamp, and other similar information. Log files and third-party scripts may also collect general demographic and visit information. We use these log files and third-party scripts to help us analyze trends and to improve the value
of the Site and services. Finally, we may also use third party scripts to collect NPD that is necessary to optimize effectiveness of advertisements appearing on other parties’ sites.
We also collect NPD which involves cookies, action tags,
and web beacons. Cookies are stored on your computer’s hard drive and identify your web browser and the activities of your computer on the Site and other websites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you may disable them. Cookies help
us facilitate efficient site navigation, improve your experience on the Site and to allow us to take note of visits to the Site and show relevant ads on our website and across the Internet. Action tags, also known as web beacons or single pixel
GIFs, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you. Any portion of the Site, including advertisements or emails sent on our behalf, may
contain action tags. Action tags can be used to count Site users, to deliver co-branded services, or to determine whether email messages have been opened or acted upon. Action tags may be used to conduct research on behalf of certain clients, to
compile statistics for advertising purposes, for auditing purposes, or to report certain aggregate information. By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gather information to improve the Site and measure the effectiveness of our
advertising and marketing campaigns. Embedded URLs allow use of the Site without cookies and we utilize them as a tracking tool to collect NPD. Embedded URLs are exhibited as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appear in the browser
address or location toolbar. They provide limited NPD about navigation on the Site during the current session.

to assist Kibo in performing the functions set forth above. The Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Kibo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the
Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this Site and the Kibo eCommerce Services.
Kibo Client websites may contain links to third-party sites for
Visitors’ convenience and/or information. If a Visitor accesses those links, he/she will leave the Kibo client’s website and be re-directed to a third-party site. Kibo does not control those sites or the privacy practices of those third-party sites,
which may differ from Kibo’s privacy practices and those of our client. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites, and the personal data Visitors choose to provide to third-party websites is not covered by this Privacy
Statement. We encourage Visitors to review the Privacy Statement of any Website or company before submitting their Personal Information to them.

or visitors can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser provide notice when a new cookie is received,
or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if a Visitor disables the use of cookies, the Visitor may be unable to access certain portions or services in our applications or those of our clients.
