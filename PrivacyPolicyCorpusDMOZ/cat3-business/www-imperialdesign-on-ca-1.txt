Privacy Policy
We believe that your personal information deserves protection.
While you can visit Imperialproduction.com, ResinMold.com,
Imperialproductions.com
or Imperialdesign.on.ca  (the "Web Sites") without
registering or providing any personal
information, you will need to register if
you want to make a purchase.
The personal information
requested is necessary to process your order.
(As
noted in the Legal Statement on the Web Site, except where stated
otherwise, the term "Imperial" used on this website shall be deemed to include
Imperial
Productions and Distribution Inc. and its
respective
affiliates, subsidiaries, successors
and assigns.)
What does Imperial use your
personal information for?
Imperial, upon placing an order or
mailing you advertising, architectural binders or
brochures,
asks for your name, address, email
address, and other
personal information
when you create an account online or upon quotation.
You
will also be asked for personal information when you make a purchase. This
information is used to process your orders and to allow us to communicate with
you.
The information also enables Imperial to customize products or services to
better meet
your preferences and to offer you products and services from
Imperial and other sources
that may be of interest to you.
When placing an order that crosses international borders, Imperial is required by
"homeland security"
to ask for a business number or social security number to clear
products through customs.  This information is used for customs only on the bill of
lading
and is not sold or rented to a third party after the fact.
It
is confidential and kept in our records.
Phone Orders
Does Imperial take verbal
phone orders?
Except for Architectural binder orders, Imperial does not take verbal orders,
we do written quotes
for
your approval and
fax or email these to you.
All
orders are procured in writing for your protection and accuracy.
We appreciate your business and
full intend to protect your privacy.
Imperial reserves the right to
change this Privacy Policy at any time.
We
also reserve the right at any time to disclose any information in an
individual's account
a) to satisfy any law, regulation or government request;
b) if such disclosure is
necessary or appropriate to site operation;
c) to protect the rights or property of
Imperial Productions®  and its users,
sponsors,      providers, licensors or merchants.

concerns regarding privacy on our site or should you wish to
have your personal information
deleted, please send a detailed description to
