Ferner hat der Betroffene bei der Ausübung des Rechts auf Datenübertragbarkeit gemäß Art. 20 Abs. 1 DSGVO das Recht, zu erwirken, dass die personenbezogenen Daten direkt von einem Verantwortlichen an einen anderen Verantwortlichen übermittelt werden, soweit dies technisch möglich ist und sofern hiervon nicht die Rechte und Freiheiten anderer Personen beeinträchtigt werden.
Zur Geltendmachung des Rechts auf Datenübertragbarkeit kann sich der Betroffene jederzeit an einen Mitarbeiter den Reimers & Janssen GmbH wenden.
8.7. Recht auf WiderspruchJeder von der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten Betroffene hat das Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus seiner besonderen Situation ergeben, jederzeit gegen die Verarbeitung der ihn betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten, die aufgrund von Art. 6 Abs. 1 Buchstaben e oder f DSGVO erfolgt, Widerspruch einzulegen. Dies gilt auch für ein auf diese Bestimmungen gestütztes Profiling.
Die Reimers & Janssen GmbH verarbeitet die personenbezogenen Daten im Falle des Widerspruchs nicht mehr, es sei denn, wir können zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Verarbeitung nachweisen, die den Interessen, Rechten und Freiheiten des Betroffenen überwiegt, oder die Verarbeitung der Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen dient.
Verarbeitet die Reimers & Janssen GmbH personenbezogene Daten, um Direktwerbung zu betreiben, so hat der Betroffene das Recht, jederzeit Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung der personenbezogenen Daten zum Zwecke derartiger Werbung einzulegen. Dies gilt auch für das Profiling, soweit es mit solcher Direktwerbung in Verbindung steht. Widerspricht der Betroffene gegenüber der Reimers & Janssen GmbH der Verarbeitung für Zwecke der Direktwerbung, so wird die Reimers & Janssen GmbH die personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr für diese Zwecke verarbeiten.
Zudem hat der Betroffene das Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus seiner besonderen Situation ergeben, gegen die betreffende Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die bei der Reimers & Janssen GmbH zu wissenschaftlichen oder historischen Forschungszwecken oder zu statistischen Zwecken gemäß Art. 89 Abs. 1 DSGVO erfolgen, Widerspruch einzulegen, es sei denn, eine solche Verarbeitung ist zur Erfüllung einer im öffentlichen Interesse liegenden Aufgabe erforderlich.
Zur Ausübung des Rechts auf Widerspruch kann sich der Betroffene direkt an einen Mitarbeiter der Reimers & Janssen GmbH wenden. Dem Betroffenen steht es ferner frei, im Zusammenhang mit der Nutzung von Diensten der Informationsgesellschaft, ungeachtet der Richtlinie 2002/58/EG, sein Widerspruchsrecht mittels automatisierter Verfahren auszuüben, bei denen technische Spezifikationen verwendet werden.
8.8. Automatisierte Entscheidungen im Einzelfall einschließlich ProfilingJeder von der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten Betroffene hat das Recht, nicht einer ausschließlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung – einschließlich Profiling – beruhenden Entscheidung unterworfen zu werden, die ihm gegenüber rechtliche Wirkung entfaltet oder ihn in ähnlicher Weise erheblich beeinträchtigt, sofern die Entscheidung nicht für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags zwischen der betroffenen Person und dem Verantwortlichen erforderlich ist, oder aufgrund von Rechtsvorschriften, denen der Verantwortliche unterliegt, zulässig ist und diese Rechtsvorschriften angemessene Maßnahmen zur Wahrung der Rechte und Freiheiten sowie der berechtigten Interessen des Betroffenen enthalten oder mit ausdrücklicher Einwilligung erfolgt.
Ist die Entscheidung für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags zwischen dem Betroffenen und dem Verantwortlichen erforderlich oder erfolgt sie mit ausdrücklicher Einwilligung des Betroffenen, trifft die Reimers & Janssen GmbH angemessene Maßnahmen, um die Rechte und Freiheiten sowie die berechtigten Interessen des Betroffenen zu wahren, wozu mindestens das Recht auf Erwirkung des Eingreifens einer Person seitens des Verantwortlichen, auf Darlegung des eigenen Standpunkts und auf Anfechtung der Entscheidung gehört.
Möchte der Betroffene Rechte mit Bezug auf automatisierte Entscheidungen geltend machen, kann er sich hierzu an einen Mitarbeiter des Verantwortlichen wenden.
8.9. Recht auf Widerruf einer datenschutzrechtlichen EinwilligungJeder von der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten Betroffene hat das Recht, eine Einwilligung zur Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten jederzeit zu widerrufen.
Möchte der Betroffene sein Recht auf Widerruf einer Einwilligung geltend machen, kann er sich hierzu jederzeit an einen Mitarbeiter des Verantwortlichen wenden.
9. Rechtsgrundlage der VerarbeitungDer Art. 6 Abs. 1 a DSGVO dient der Reimers & Janssen GmbH als Rechtsgrundlage für Verarbeitungsvorgänge, bei denen wir eine Einwilligung für einen bestimmten Verarbeitungszweck einholen. Ist die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten zur Erfüllung eines Vertrags, dessen Vertragspartei der Betroffene ist, erforderlich, wie dies beispielsweise bei Verarbeitungsvorgängen der Fall ist, die für eine Lieferung von Waren oder die Erbringung einer sonstigen Leistung oder Gegenleistung notwendig sind, so beruht die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 b DSGVO. Gleiches gilt für solche Verarbeitungsvorgänge die zur Durchführung vorvertraglicher Maßnahmen erforderlich sind, etwa in Fällen von Anfragen zur unseren Produkten oder Leistungen. Unterliegt unser Unternehmen einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung, durch welche eine Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten erforderlich wird, wie beispielsweise zur Erfüllung steuerlicher Pflichten, so basiert die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 c DSGVO. In seltenen Fällen könnte die Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten erforderlich werden, um lebenswichtige Interessen der Betroffenen oder einer anderen natürlichen Person zu schützen. Dies wäre beispielsweise der Fall, wenn ein Besucher in unserem Betrieb verletzt werden würde und daraufhin sein Name, sein Alter, seine Krankenkassendaten oder sonstige schutzrelevante Informationen an einen Arzt, ein Krankenhaus oder sonstige Dritte weitergegeben werden müssten. Dann würde die Verarbeitung auf Art. 6 Abs 1 d DSGVO beruhen. Letztlich könnten Verarbeitungsvorgänge auf Art. 6 Abs. 1 f DSGVO beruhen.
Auf dieser Rechtsgrundlage basieren Verarbeitungsvorgänge, die von keiner der vorgenannten Rechtsgrundlagen erfasst werden, wenn die Verarbeitung zur Wahrung eines berechtigten Interesses unseres Unternehmens oder eines Dritten erforderlich ist, sofern die Interessen, Grundrechte und Grundfreiheiten des Betroffenen nicht überwiegen. Solche Verarbeitungsvorgänge sind uns insbesondere deshalb gestattet, weil sie durch den Gesetzgeber besonders erwähnt wurden (Erwägungsgrund 47 Satz 2 DSGVO).
10. Berechtigte Interessen an der Verarbeitung, die von dem Verantwortlichen oder einem Dritten verfolgt werdenBasiert die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten auf Artikel 6 Abs. 1 f DSGVO ist unser berechtigtes Interesse die Durchführung unserer Geschäftstätigkeit zugunsten des Wohlergehens all unserer Mitarbeiter und unserer Anteilseigner.
11. Dauer, für die die personenbezogenen Daten gespeichert werdenDas Kriterium für die Dauer der Speicherung von personenbezogenen Daten ist die jeweilige gesetzliche Aufbewahrungsfrist. Nach Ablauf der Frist werden die entsprechenden Daten routinemäßig gelöscht, sofern sie nicht mehr zur Vertragserfüllung oder Vertragsanbahnung erforderlich sind.
12. Gesetzliche oder vertragliche Vorschriften zur Bereitstellung der personenbezogenen DatenWir klären Sie darüber auf, dass die Bereitstellung personenbezogener Daten zum Teil gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist (z.B. Steuervorschriften) oder sich auch aus vertraglichen Regelungen (z.B. Angaben zum Vertragspartner) ergeben kann. Mitunter kann es zu einem Vertragsschluss erforderlich sein, dass ein Betroffener uns personenbezogene Daten zur Verfügung stellt, die in der Folge durch uns verarbeitet werden müssen. Zum Abschluss eines Vertrages ist der Betroffene verpflichtet, uns personenbezogene Daten bereitzustellen. Falls der Betroffene seine personenbezogenen Daten nicht bereitstellt, kann kein Vertrag mit dem Betroffenen geschlossen werden. Vor einer Bereitstellung personenbezogener Daten durch den Betroffenen kann sich der Betroffene an den Verantwortlichen wenden.
Die Reimers & Janssen GmbH klärt den Betroffenen einzelfallbezogen darüber auf, ob die Bereitstellung der personenbezogenen Daten gesetzlich oder vertraglich vorgeschrieben oder für den Vertragsabschluss erforderlich ist, ob eine Verpflichtung besteht, die personenbezogenen Daten bereitzustellen, und welche Folgen die Nichtbereitstellung der personenbezogenen Daten hätte.
13. Bestehen einer automatisierten EntscheidungsfindungUnser Unternehmen verzichtet auf automatische Entscheidungsfindung oder Profiling.
14. Google AnalyticsDiese Website benutzt Google Analytics, einen Webanalysedienst der Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA („Google“). Die Benutzung erfolgt auf der Grundlage des Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f. DSGVO. Google Analytics verwendet sog. „Cookies“, Textdateien, die auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert werden und die eine Analyse der Benutzung der Website durch Sie ermöglichen. Die durch den Cookie erzeugten Informationen über Ihre Benutzung der Website wie
Browser-Typ/-Version,
verwendetes Betriebssystem,
Referrer-URL (die zuvor besuchte Seite),
Hostname des zugreifenden Rechners (IP-Adresse),
Uhrzeit der Serveranfrage,
werden in der Regel an einen Server von Google in den USA übertragen und dort gespeichert. Die im Rahmen von Google Analytics von Ihrem Browser übermittelte IP-Adresse wird nicht mit anderen Daten von Google zusammengeführt. Wir haben zudem auf dieser Website Google Analytics um den Code „anonymizeIP“ erweitert. Dies garantiert die Maskierung Ihrer IP-Adresse, sodass alle Daten anonym erhoben werden. Nur in Ausnahmefällen wird die volle IP-Adresse an einen Server von Google in den USA übertragen und dort gekürzt.
Im Auftrag des Betreibers dieser Website wird Google diese Information benutzen, um Ihre Nutzung der Website auszuwerten, um Reports über die Webseiten-Aktivitäten zusammenzustellen und um weitere mit der Webseiten-Nutzung und der Internetnutzung verbundene Dienstleistungen gegenüber dem Webseitenbetreiber zu erbringen. Sie können die Speicherung der Cookies durch eine entsprechende Einstellung Ihrer Browser-Software verhindern; wir weisen Sie jedoch darauf hin, dass Sie in diesem Fall möglicherweise nicht sämtliche Funktionen dieser Website vollumfänglich nutzen werden können.
Sie können darüber hinaus die Erfassung der durch den Cookie erzeugten und auf Ihre Nutzung der Website bezogenen Daten (inkl. Ihrer IP-Adresse) an Google sowie die Verarbeitung dieser Daten durch Google verhindern, indem Sie das unter dem folgenden Link verfügbare Browser-Plugin herunterladen und installieren. Alternativ zum Browser-Add-On, insbesondere bei Browsern auf mobilen Endgeräten, können Sie die Erfassung durch Google Analytics zudem verhindern.

15. FacebookUnsere Website verwendet Social Plugins (Plugins) des sozialen Netzwerkes von Facebook. Dieser Dienst wird von der Facebook Inc. (Facebook), 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA betrieben. Die Plugins sind an einem der verschiedenen Facebook Logos erkennbar (weißes „f“ auf blauer Kachel oder ein „Daumen hoch“-Zeichen) oder sind mit dem Zusatz “Facebook Social Plugin” gekennzeichnet. Die Liste und das Aussehen der Facebook Social Plugins kann hier eingesehen werden: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
Wenn ein Nutzer eine Website unseres Webangebots besucht, die ein solches Plugin enthält, baut sein Browser eine direkte Verbindung mit den Servern von Facebook auf. Der Inhalt des Plugins wird von Facebook direkt an Ihren Browser übermittelt und von diesem in die Website eingebunden. Wir haben daher keinen Einfluss auf den Umfang der Daten, die Facebook mit Hilfe dieses Plugins erhebt und informieren die Betroffenen daher entsprechend unserem Kenntnisstand: Durch die Einbindung der Plugins erhält Facebook die Information, dass ein Nutzer die entsprechende Seite des Angebots aufgerufen hat. Ist der Nutzer bei Facebook eingeloggt, kann Facebook den Besuch seinem Facebook-Konto zuordnen. Wenn Nutzer mit den Plugins interagieren, zum Beispiel den Like Button betätigen oder einen Kommentar abgeben, wird die entsprechende Information von Ihrem Browser direkt an Facebook übermittelt und dort gespeichert. Falls ein Nutzer kein Mitglied von Facebook ist, besteht trotzdem die Möglichkeit, dass Facebook seine IP-Adresse speichert. Laut Facebook wird in Deutschland nur eine anonymisierte IP-Adresse gespeichert.
Zweck und Umfang der Datenerhebung und die weitere Verarbeitung und Nutzung der Daten durch Facebook sowie die diesbezüglichen Rechte und Einstellungsmöglichkeiten zum Schutz der Privatsphäre der Nutzer können Sie den Datenschutz-Hinweisen von Facebook entnehmen.
Wenn ein Nutzer Facebook-Mitglied ist und nicht möchte, dass Facebook über dieses Angebot Daten über ihn sammelt und mit seinen bei Facebook gespeicherten Mitgliedsdaten verknüpft, muss er sich vor dem Besuch des Internetauftritts bei Facebook ausloggen.
Weitere Einstellungen und Widersprüche zur Nutzung von Daten für Werbezwecke, sind innerhalb der Facebook-Profileinstellungen möglich.. Die Einstellungen erfolgen plattformunabhängig, d.h. sie werden für alle Geräte, wie Desktopcomputer oder mobile Geräte übernommen.
