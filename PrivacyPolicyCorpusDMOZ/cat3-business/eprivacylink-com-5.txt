RhinoRock Concrete Fence Learn about RhinoRock concrete fencing options RhinoRock is a uniquely designed concrete fence fabricated by combining a reinforced concrete outer shell with a structural foam core.When a reinforced concrete outer shell is combined with a foam core you end up with a surprisingly lightweight concrete fence. RhinoRock has been tested technically and proves to support over one and a half tons of water placed on the panels free spanning face, or the equivalent of a 140 mph wind load. Each 6 x 9 ft pane weighs only 270 pounds. For comparison, a solid concrete panel that is the same size weighs 25,000 pounds. RhinoRock is known for being strong and durable due to the outer shell made of high-performance fiber reinforced concrete. A small three-man crew can easily install 300-600 linear feet of RhinoRock per day by hand. Compare this to a much larger crew that relies on heavy construction equipment and cranes to put up a normal concrete fence. When you meld reinforced concrete with structural foam core, you have a fence that is easier to install, but very strong. Believe it or not, RhinoRock Concrete Fence panels are durable and very affordable. Each 6 x 9 ft panel is manuffactured to be 90% lighter than a traditional concrete fence panel. Because of this, less weight means less production, installation, and shipping costs. Did we mention it is easier to install? RhinoRock Concrete Fence panels are a great choice if your customers want a stone fence on a budget. If you are looking for the beauty of stone, the durability that premium contractors demand, and the budget that homeowners want, RhinoRock Concrete Fence is the perfect choice for you.

See what our customers are saying... "We proposed using Noodle Link on a large job for a major company, which was approved. The company has two locations. We were awarded one location. The other location was awarded to another fence company that put up chain link only and hand inserted the slats afterward. We both started at the same time. We finished more than two weeks earlier than the company that hand inserted the slats..."- Jeff in Pennsylvania
"What a time saver Noodle Link is. We will certainly use Noodle Link on our next job. We can't believe how beautiful this job turned out and it was a 10-foot installation. It was a no-brainer to consider and use this product."- Denise in Florida
"My customer tried Noodle Link last October and liked it so well that he has asked me for another Noodle Link quote for $40,000."- Adam in West Virginia
