SUBMITTING PHOTOS
By submitting photos (“Images”) to the picture submission program conducted by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc.

It is not MCINTOSH's intention that people be the focus of the images displayed in the picture submission program but rather the focus is on the equipment, the installation, and the setting. However, including people in the images is not prohibited. You state that you are the author of the Images and the sole and exclusive owner of copyright in the Images and have all rights necessary, including any personal rights of individuals that may be depicted in the Images, and that no other person has rights or the basis to make the claim with respect to the Images, nor is any permission or consent from any other person necessary for you to grant the license described above. And, you further state that the anticipated use by MCINTOSH would not violate any agreement or arrangement that you have with another party. If there are any issues in this regard, then please do not submit the Images.

If there are any “take down” requests, MCINTOSH reserves the right to discontinue the display of any Images or any one of them without conducting an investigation and without contacting you about the take down request.
Although it is anticipated that you will agree to these terms through a click-through agreement online, by submitting the Images to picture submission program, you agree to these terms and grant the license described above.
