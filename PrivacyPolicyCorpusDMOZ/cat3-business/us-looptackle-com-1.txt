Controller
LOOP Tackle Design AB, corporate identity number 556225-0471 with postal address Box 6064, 192 06 Sollentuna, Sweden is the controller of your personal data.
If you wish to exercise your rights under this Policy or get in contact with us regarding our processing of your personal data, you can do this by contacting us by telephone 0854410190 or by e-mail info@looptackle.se.
If you must share your personal data with us
This policy applies to information we collect:
On our website located at looptackle.com (the “Website”).
When you contact us for information or for customer service purposes.
When you make a purchase.
When you create or maintain a customer account.
It does not apply to information collected by:
Any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website.
We need to process some of your personal data in order to be able to conclude and administrate your purchase, provide your customer account and to be able to comply with regulatory requirements. You must therefore provide these personal information to us.
If you do not provide such personal data, you will not be able to make purchases or create a customer account with us. What personal data you must provide can be found in the tables below where the legal basis is stated to be “performance of contract” or “legal obligation”.
If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website or provide information to us. By providing us information or accessing or using our Website, you agree to this privacy policy.
How we share your personal data
Your personal data is mainly only processed by LOOP Tackle Design. However, your personal data will be shared with third parties as set out below:
In order to have a functioning IT system and conduct our business efficiently we share your personal data with our IT-suppliers. Your personal data is only shared to the extent necessary for our suppliers to perform their obligations in the contract they have with us.
In order to administer your payment, we will share your personal data with the supplier providing the payment solution that we use. If you choose to pay via invoice, the payment service provider also may share your personal data with a credit agency to assess your financial situation.
In order for us to deliver your goods to you, and to handle any returns, we will share your personal data with the carrier that you choose in the check-out.
In order to handle customer service matters, we share your personal data with the company providing customer service on our behalf.
In order to give you and other potential customers customised marketing via digital channels, we will share your personal data with the relevant third party providing the digital channel.
We share your personal data with external partners that help us manage our marketing through the digital channels.
To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of LOOP Tackle Design’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by LOOP Tackle Design is among the assets transferred.
To enforce or apply our terms of sale and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of LOOP Tackle Design, our customers, or others.
Transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA
LOOP Tackle Design, our suppliers and partners will as a main principle only process your personal data within the EU/EES. In case personal data processes outside of the EU/EES there is either a decision from the commission ensuring that the third country in question has an adequate level of protection or appropriate safeguards in the form of standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or Privacy Shield, which ensures that your rights are protected. If you have any questions regarding how we share your personal data or if you want more information about the appropriate safeguards we have in place to protect your personal data, please feel free to contact us.
Your rights
Under data protection legislation, depending on the circumstances, you are entitled to a variety of rights when we process your personal data. We set these out below.
Right to withdraw consent and to object to processing
If we are relying on your consent to process your personal data you have a right to, wholly or partly, withdraw any given consent for the processing of your personal data. Your withdrawal will have effect from the time of your withdrawal.
You have a right to object to direct marketing and automated decision marking (including profiling), such as newsletters and customised marketing.
You have a right to object to our processing when the processing is based on a “balance of legitimate interests” legal basis (read more about what this means below and we set out in this privacy policy when we process your personal data on this basis). In some other cases, the right to object does not exist (e.g. since we must store your personal data). Please note that we are not obliged to uphold your objection, if we can show compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweigh your interests or if it is for the purpose of establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.
Right to information and access
You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not we are processing personal data about you and information about the personal data that we process, such as the purposes of the processing, categories and receipts of your personal data, and for how long we store your personal data. You can gain access to this information and obtain a copy of the personal data processed by us by contacting us as described in the beginning of this privacy policy.
Right to rectification
You have a right to correct or update any inaccurate personal data concerning you that we may be processing and to ask us to have incomplete personal data completed. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Right to erasure (“the right to be forgotten”) and restriction of processing
Under certain circumstances, you have a right to request that we delete your personal data. This is the case for example where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or you withdraw your consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for our continued processing for your personal data.
You also have a right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data. That is the case for example when the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, or the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it and instead you request that we restrict our use of it.
Right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority
If you have any complaints regarding our processing of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You may do this in particular in the EU/EEA member state of your habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the applicable data protection laws. In Sweden, the Swedish Data Protection Authority (www.datainspektionen.se) is the supervisory authority. You also have the right to seek a remedy from a national court.
Right to data portability
You have a right to ask us to transfer certain of your personal data we have about you to another company (data portability). We will provide your personal data in a structured commonly used, machine-readable format.
Purpose and legal bases for the processing of your personal data
