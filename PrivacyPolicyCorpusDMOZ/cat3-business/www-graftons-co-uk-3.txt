Cookies help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate.
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember certain information about you. This can include which pages you have visited, choices you have made from menus, any specific information you have entered into forms and the time and date of your visit. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.
Two types of cookies are used on this website:
Session CookiesSession cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you close the browser. We use session cookies to carry information across pages of our site and avoid you having to re-enter information each time you enter a new page.
Persistent CookiesPersistent cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser even after the browser is closed. The length of time a cookie remains depends on its lifespan.
We use persistent cookies to collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use the website and help us improve the structure of our website.

WHICH COOKIES ARE USED BY IBD BEAUTY?
The Cookies we use are;
Name: PSCMS-SESSION [32 Character randomly generated salted MD5 hash] Host:www.ibdbeauty.co.uk Path: / Secure: No Expires: At End of Session
The PSMS_SESSION cookie is a randomly generated used to allow users to log in. When the user logs in, the value of the cookie is stored in the contact_e_sessions table of the web database against their contact ID so that when they browse the site they do not have to log in each time. The session ID is also used to track ecommerce baskets that are modified before a user has logged in, upon logging in any baskets created with their session ID will be transferred to the contact they have logged in as. Logging out will delete the contact_e_session record in the database. Closing the browser will delete the cookie.
Name: JSESSIONID Value: [22 character randomly generated base 64 hash] Host: www.ibdbeauty.co.uk Path: /cms and / Source: No Expires: At End of Session
The two JSESSIONID cookies are automatically generated by the java server but are not used. The / cookie is generated by the url rewrite package and the /cms cookie is generated by the CMS engine itself. Depending on your path through the site, you may end up with one or both of these cookies, but they are not in use and we have no plan to use them in future. Denying these cookies or deleting them at any point should have no effect.
