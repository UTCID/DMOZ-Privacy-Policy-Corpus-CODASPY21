Privacy and Security Information
Your Privacy is Important UDA holds the privacy and security
of our site visitors and clients in the highest regard. The following information
explains what kind of information is gathered on our site and how that
information is used.
We can be reached via email at info@uda1.com,
postal mail at UDA Customer Service, UDA Technologies, Inc., PO
Box 3355, Auburn, Alabama 36831 , or you can contact UDA Customer Assistance
by telephone at 1-800-700-8321 US, 1-334-821-4158 International.  What type of information is collected? You can visit our site without telling
us who you are or revealing any personal information. While IP addresses
(the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session,
the user remains anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives us an idea of which
parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. We
do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means
that a user's session is tracked, but the user is anonymous. The user's
browser also lets us know the type of computer and operating system being
used.  We retain the email addresses of only
those who have requested, downloaded or purchased products from us in the UDA Marketplace,
and those who sign up for one or more of our enewsletters.  How is information used? Email addresses are used to send you
information that you requested and periodically check back with additional
information or feedback. We never sell, rent, or loan our email lists to
outside firms: No Spam.  UDA respects your privacy and will
not release names, addresses or contact information of clients. What levels of security does UDA utilize? UDA
uses Secure Servers for Online Orders and Credit Card transactions protected
by VeriSign's NetSure Protection Plan
using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the strongest security
available today. NetSure provides up to $100,000 of protection against
economic loss due to theft, impersonation or corruption.  Copyright ©1997-2010 UDA Technologies, Inc. (UDA)
