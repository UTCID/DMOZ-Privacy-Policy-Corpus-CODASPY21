ESL Federal Credit Union Social Media Public Use Policy
ESL Federal Credit Union values open and ongoing dialogue with our customers and our community. The goal of our (Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/Instagram) page is to provide a forum for engaging, positive conversation on topics that are important and valuable to the people we serve. We hope to share information and ideas that contribute to the financial well-being of all members of our community and foster a healthy discussion on issues that are of interest to us all.
Keep in mind that banking is a highly regulated industry, so we have certain rules to follow to protect individual privacy and to provide clear and transparent communication. All content is monitored, and though we’ll make every effort to be responsive, we may not be able to reply to every comment.
Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to ESL’s Facebook/LinkedIn pages or Twitter posts:
Be polite and courteous – Abusive, hateful, offensive, bullying, profanity, or the like will not be tolerated.
Stay on topic – Keep the conversation relevant to the community and contribute to the dialogue. We will remove content that is off topic, out of context, promotional, or has an embedded link to draw traffic to another inappropriate site.
Obey all laws including, but not limited to, copyright, privacy, and proprietary rights.
No anonymous or fake posting – All postings must be from a real person and Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn profile.
Do not post personal or sensitive information on the ESL Facebook page – Connect with us directly for any customer service related questions about your accounts, complaints, or concerns and do our best to respond in a timely manner. Please note that any personal or sensitive information published on ESL pages by members/customers will be removed.
ESL reserves the right to remove any post that does not adhere to these guidelines and will block anyone who repeatedly violates them.
Following a Facebook/ Twitter/ LinkedIn/Instagram account or including an account in a Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/Instagram list does not constitute endorsement by ESL.
The posting and presence of content on Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/Instagram and on this site does not necessarily mean that ESL agrees with the content, ensures the accuracy, or otherwise approves of it. Nothing in any Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn/Instagram page constitutes a binding representation, agreement, or an endorsement on the part of ESL Federal Credit Union. Please review Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn’s terms of use when engaging on the site.
ESL employees are required to follow these additional guidelines:
ESL has a dedicated Social Media team tasked with responding to member/customers inquiries and feedback. If you are an ESL employee who is NOT part of that team do not respond to member/customer inquiries directed specifically to ESL or asking for an official company response on this site.
Familiarize yourself with ESL’s Code of Conduct Policy and Social Media Procedures – Before engaging on any social media site, make sure you have read and understand ESL’s Code of Conduct Policy and Information Security Standards/Guidelines.
Customer Service Inquiries
To protect our customers’ privacy, we do not use social media channels to address questions about ESL accounts or specific customer issues. We love to help our customers and invite you to connect with us so we can help. For a full listing of locations and services, click here.
