PRIVACY POLICY
EVOLV®
Last updated 8 March 2018.  Effective immediately.
At Evolv USA, LLC, dba Evolv North America, we recognize the importance of our customer’s personally identifiable information or data (collectively the “personal information”) and privacy.  Evolv uses your personal information mainly to improve our products, Services, and advertising.  This Evolv Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how Evolv and its parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies (collectively “Evolv”, “we”, or “us”) collect, use, share, and store information through the mail, retail stores and wholesale accounts, Evolv.com and other Evolv websites that link to this privacy policy, and Evolv mobile services, including our mobile application (the “App”) (collectively the “Services”).
By visiting any Evolv Website (the “Websites”) or App, and/or by using the Services, including but not limited to, creating a Evolv account, purchasing and/or registering a product, downloading materials, registering for newsletters or updates, participating in an online survey, accessing customer care or warranty services, or by otherwise providing any personal information or data to Evolv, you agree to the policies described herein and to the Terms of Use, which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by this reference.  Please review this Privacy Policy and contact us at info@evolvsports.us if you have any questions.
Collection and Use of Information
Personal Information.  When you access the Evolv Website or App, use our Services, or otherwise provide any personal information or data to us, we may collect, use, and store that personal information, including but not limited to your name, mailing, shipping and billing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, activity interests, date of birth, gender, and credit card information.  We may also collect information that you provide to us about other people, for example, by purchasing gifts or products for family or friends, we may collect their name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.  The personal information we collect allows us and our marketing provider(s) to keep you posted on Evolv’s latest product announcements, updates, upcoming events, and Evolv news, and helps us to improve our products, Services, content, and advertising.  If you do not want to be included on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by changing your account preferences or clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.  From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about a specific sales or service transaction, our products, their proper use, purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.  Because this information is important to you, your use of Evolv products, and your relationship with Evolv, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.  We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, processing payments and orders, and research to improve our products, Services, and customer communications.  If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, or access linked social media accounts, we may collect and use the information you provide to administer those programs.  In addition, information that you give us may be combined with other personal information (e.g., order history, demographic data, etc.) from third-party sources to improve our products, Services, and programs.  For example, we may receive updated delivery and address information from third-party sources, which we use to correct our records and insure delivery of Evolv products and materials to you.
Our App uses the GPS feature of your mobile device to determine the location of the device, activities engaged in, and similar information. We and our third-party vendors or partners may collect and use this for purposes such as the functioning of the App, to make our advertising more relevant, and to improve our services.
Non-Personal Information. We may collect non-personal information, i.e., information that is not associated with a specific individual, from you when you visit the Websites and/or use our Services.  This information may include your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet), browser type and language, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring and exit pages, operating system, date and time stamp, and other data.  The IP address does not identify your name, email address, or other personal information.  We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Websites, understand and analyze trends, learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We may also collect information, such as your occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where our products are used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products and advertising.  We also may collect information about how you use our Websites and Services from our other products. For example, some e-mail communications you may receive from Evolv Websites, Apps, and/or Services may include a clickable URL, which will automatically direct you to the Websites and collect non-personal information in the process. To avoid having your non-personal information collected, do not click on URL links presented in any Evolv electronic communications. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
We may also collect non-personal information through the use of “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.  A cookie is a file that is added to your computer so that the Websites can remember something about you, for example, to retain the contents in your shopping cart.  This helps us to better understand our customer’s use of the Websites and preferences, tells us which parts of our Websites our customers have visited and the frequency and length of such visits, helps us improve the appearance and functionality of the Websites, and measures and facilitates our understanding of the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.  We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.  When non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.  Cookies may remain on your computer after you log off the Websites.  By modifying your Web browser settings, you may refuse to accept cookies.  If you do so, you may not be able to access or use certain features of the Websites. For more information on the cookies Evolv saves, please visit,https://www.evolvsports.com/media/pdf/e8/69/6e/evolvsports.pdf.
Use of Information.  Financial and personal information that you provide is used to process your order, verify, bill, and collect payment for products that you order.  We may use your contact information from any order to send Evolv products, catalogs, emails, and other information about Evolv, its affiliates, and/or its partners.  If you register for evolvsports’s newsletter or mailing list and provide your email address to us, we will send you emails or other communications that may inform you of new products, special sales, promotional offers from Evolv, our affiliates, partners, Evolv news, and any other events or issues that we think you may enjoy or find interesting.  You may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the steps described below in "Removing, Correcting or Changing Your Information".
