Mediation Process
In the event of any controversy, dispute, or claim of any type or description arising between you, on the one hand, and EXECONNECT, on the other hand, that cannot be resolved between parties, then either one of us will refer that controversy, dispute, or claim in writing to the San Jose, California Dispute Resolution Center of JAMS for mediation, that is, an informal, non-binding conference or conferences between you and EXECONNECT in which a retired judge or justice will seek to guide all of the parties to a resolution of the controversy, dispute, or claim.
You and EXECONNECT will be free to select any mutually acceptable panel member from the list of retired judges and justices at JAMS whose names and backgrounds are available on the Internet at http://www.jamsadr.com, provided that you select as a mediator a retired judge or justice having experience in resolving contract, intellectual property, Internet, and/or electronic commerce matters.
If you and EXECONNECT are unable to agree upon a mediator within 10 business days after its receipt of a written referral from you, then, at the written request by any of the parties to JAMS, an ADR Specialist with JAMS will forward to each of us a list of 5 available mediators having background and experience as set forth above with the request that each of us independently rank all 5 mediators in order of preference with the single use of a numeral between one and five, and return such ranking within 5 business days of the receipt of such list from JAMS.
Based upon the rankings, the ADR Specialist will select the mediator.
Subsequent to the selection of a mediator, whether by the parties or by an ADR Specialist with JAMS, he or she will promptly set a date and time for the initial session or telephone conference with the parties, but not later than 30 days after the date of his or her selection.
Each of us agrees that, in addition to counsel, a representative of each of us, other than counsel, who has full settlement authority will be required to be present at all mediation sessions.
In addition, each of us may bring such additional persons as may be, in your or our sole determination, needed to respond to questions, contribute information, and participate in the sessions.
The number of such additional persons must be agreed upon in advance with the assistance and advice of the mediator.
No later than 5 business days before such initial session, each of us will deliver a concise written summary of its position together with any appropriate documents and a proposed solution to the matters in controversy to the mediator and also serve a copy on the other of us.
In the event the mediation process does not result in a mutually acceptable resolution of the controversy, dispute, or claim, only then will either of us will have the right to commence litigation only in the courts named above.
This required mediation process is to be considered settlement negotiations for the purposes of all Federal and state rules in the United States protecting disclosures made during such conferences from later discovery or use in evidence.
The costs of the mediator will be borne equally by each of us.
The provisions for this required mediation process will be deemed arbitration provisions solely and exclusively for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the obligation of each of us to fully comply with those provisions for this required mediation process.
In the event either of us is required to commence legal proceedings to enforce the other's compliance with the provisions for this required mediation process, then the one of us bringing the enforcement proceeding will, if successful, be entitled to an award of his, her, or its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such enforcement proceeding.
This provision does not nor is it intended to provide for an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with a resolution or the outcome of the underlying matters that are subject to the required mediation process.
