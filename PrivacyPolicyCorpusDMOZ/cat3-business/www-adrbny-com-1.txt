("Websites"). The information set out in this notice is provided in addition to our privacy notice,

Managing Cookies settings from within your browser
Most browsers are initially set to accept Cookies, an option you change via your internet browser settings. It may also be possible to configure your browser settings to enable acceptance of only specific Cookies or to notify you each time a new Cookie is about to be stored on your device enabling you to decide whether to accept or reject the Cookie. You can also disable Cookies by configuring your browser setting to reject all Cookies. Please refer to the help section of your browser for instructions on how to manage your Cookies settings, or follow the links below:

If you do not wish to accept Cookies from our Websites please either disable them or refrain from using our Websites. As noted above, if you disable Cookies, you may experience reduced functionality.
What is a Cookie?
A Cookie is a small file placed on your device when you visit certain websites. Cookies provide a way for the Websites to recognise users and keep track of the users' preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preference) over a period of time, so users don't have to keep re-entering them whenever they come back to the websites. Cookies perform essential functions to improve a user’s browsing experience.
You do not need to have Cookies turned on to visit most of our Websites. However, having Cookies turned on should allow for a better, personalised experience, and is required for certain parts of the Websites' functionality.
Who sets Cookies?
Cookies may be set by our Websites or by another site prior to or during your visit to our Websites.
These are known as ‘first party’ and ‘third party’ Cookies.
First party Cookies belong to the website domain that appears in the browser address bar.
Third-party Cookies belong to website domains different from the one shown in the address bar. Some web pages can feature content from third-party domains (such as banner ads). Other sites may also set Cookies on your device during a visit to one of our Websites. These sites will be approved partners of ours listed in the below cookie list.
How long do Cookies last?
Cookies can be placed either for an individual "session" or on a "persistent" basis.
"Session" Cookies are temporary and will expire at the end of a browser session; that is, when you leave a website. Session Cookies allow a website to recognize you and carry information as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website efficiently.
"Persistent Cookies" remain in the Cookie file of your browser even after you leave a website and after the browser is closed. These Cookies remain valid until their set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). These Cookies allow a website to collect and analyze (on an anonymous basis) traffic and use of the website, monitor the system and improve operating performance. For example, they enable a website to recognize you on your return, remember your preferences and provide tailored services to you. For more information about Cookies, how they work, why they are so useful and how to disable them, please visit
www.allaboutcookies.org.
Cookies on our Websites
Below we describe the Cookies we deploy on our Websites, organised by the categories defined by the International Chamber of Commerce.
This list (together with the rest of this notice) is reviewed every 3 months and is subject to change from time to time.
We will not set any cookies other than those that are Strictly Necessary without your consent. When we add new Third Party cookies we will seek your consent again, and we will always ask you to refresh your consent every 365 days.
Third Party Sites
Our Websites may contain links to third party sites (including social media bookmarking buttons which enable you to share certain content on our Websites). Please review the Cookie and Privacy policies of these sites to understand how they may use Cookies and your information.
Third Party Advertising
We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. To measure and track the effectiveness of such ads and to personalise advertising content to you, these companies will use Cookies and other tracking technologies, e.g. by setting a Cookie on your device when you click on one of our ads or visit a webpage associated with our campaigns. These companies may also use and measure information about your visits to our Websites as part of this same process. Third-party Cookies and tracking technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy or Cookies policy, not our Cookie Notice.
When accessing any third-party/external sites via links provided, you will leave our Websites. These third party sites are not controlled or endorsed by BNY Mellon, and BNY Mellon is not responsible for the contents, operation or security of these sites.
Opting-out of Third Party Advertising
You have the ability to opt out of many third-party advertisers. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”)
Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by
DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”)
Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by
NAI members.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA
Consumer Choice Page or the NAI
Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Websites or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject Cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at
www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at
www.networkadvertising.org.
