DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
THE SITES MAY CONTAIN ADVICE, OPINIONS, INSTRUCTIONS AND STATEMENTS FROM TNG, ITS USERS AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION PROVIDERS. THIS CONTENT IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR INFORMATIONAL AND ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. YOU USE THE SITES AND CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITES ARE PROVIDED BY TNG ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TNG MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SITES OR THE INFORMATION OR CONTENT INCLUDED ON THE SITES. TNG MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE SITES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, SECURE, OR TIMELY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TNG EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND THOSE ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, TRADE, USAGE OR PERFORMANCE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND THEREFORE SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER TNG, NOR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS AND SUPPLIERS, NOR EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU AND/OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PRIVACY, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IN THE EVENT OF FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR STRICT OR PRODUCT LIABILITY.

ADDITIONAL TERMS
a. Severance. If any part of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remainder will remain in full force and effect, provided that the allocation of risks described herein is given effect to the fullest extent possible.
b. No Assignment. These Terms (including terms incorporated into them, e.g., the Privacy Policy) are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign or delegate them to anyone without the express written permission of TNG. Any attempt by you to assign, transfer or delegate these Terms without the express written permission of TNG will be null and void. TNG shall have the right to transfer, assign and/or delegate these Terms to one or more third parties without your permission.
c. Disputes; Choice of Law; Export Limitations. The Sites are controlled by us from our offices within the United States of America. If you choose to access this Site from locations outside the U.S., you do so at your own risk and you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export anything from the Sites in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations or the Terms. By visiting the Sites, you agree that these Terms and all performances and claims of every nature (including without limitation, contract, tort and strict liability) relating in any way to any aspect of the Sites will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Michigan, U.S.A., without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the law of a different jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Sites or to products or services sold or distributed by TNG or through the Sites will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
d. Limitations on Actions. Any action concerning any dispute you may have with respect to the Sites must be commenced within one year after the cause of the dispute arises, or the cause of action is barred.
e. Paragraph Headings. The paragraph headings in these Terms are included to help make these Terms easier to read and have no binding effect.
f. Entire Agreement. These Terms (including terms incorporated into them, e.g., the Privacy Policy) comprise the entire agreement (the "Entire Agreement") between you and TNG with respect to the use of the Sites and supersedes all contemporaneous and prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein, and neither party has relied on any representations made by the other that are not expressly set forth in the Entire Agreement.
g. No Waiver. The failure of TNG to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms, including any failure to act with respect to a breach, will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or TNG's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We suggest that you print out a copy of these Terms for your records.
PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide TNG’s copyright agent with the following information:
