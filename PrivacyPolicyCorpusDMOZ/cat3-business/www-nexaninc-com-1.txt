Aluminum Privacy Fence - Privacy and Security... Unmatched!
Take some time off... and relax... right in your own backyard. Create a safe and secure play area for your children. Solace™ aluminum fence satisfies a timely need as the next generation in privacy and security fencing. Developed literally from the ground up, Solace™ solves the common problems associated with wood, composite and vinyl privacy fences. No nails to come out, no plastic to freeze and break... and no maintenance! Patent-pending aircraft aluminum extrusions were designed for simple and fast installation, while providing the highest strength necessary for security. Uniquely designed, interlocking panels provide complete privacy. High strength aluminum permits spanning farther and higher without extra braces and supports, creating a good neighbor fence. The powder coat finish allows for multiple UV stable color choices that blend naturally into any landscape. Solace™ is a dream come true for security and privacy needs.
