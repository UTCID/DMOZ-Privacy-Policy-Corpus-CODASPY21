THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT, OR SYSTEM INTEGRATION.

Except where the Company is liable, you agree to indemnify and hold Company harmless, and, at Company’s request, to defend Company from and against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, loss or liability, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent that such action is based upon, arises out of, or relates to: (i) your use of (or inability to use) any and all portions of the Site; (ii) your violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (iii) the infringement by you, or any other person using your password and account, of any right of any person or entity; or (iv) any other of your activities relating to your use of this Site.

14. Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises out of or relates to the Site or this Agreement or its breach (with the exception of rights to injunctive relief with respect to intellectual property rights), and the parties have not been successful in resolving the dispute through direct negotiation, then the dispute will be resolved in binding arbitration as follows: (i) the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules; (ii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) the location of the arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. or such other location as the parties may mutually agree; and (iv) the parties will have the right to take discovery of the other party by any method allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator(s) will each be a natural person who has never been employed (either as an employee or as an independent consultant) by either of the parties, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, and will be familiar with the business of the parties. The arbitrator(s) may upon request exclude from use in the arbitration proceeding any evidence not made available to the other party pursuant to a proper discovery request. The arbitrator(s) will issue a reasoned award. The cost of the arbitration will be borne equally by the parties pending the award. Upon the decision of the arbitrator(s), the prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the other party its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The parties, their representatives, other participants, the arbitrator(s) and the administrator(s) of the arbitration will hold in confidence the existence, content and outcome of the arbitration.

Subject to Section 13 herein, by accessing or using the Site, you and Company each agree that the internal laws of the State of Illinois, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict of laws provisions will govern with respect to all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement, or the use (or inability to use) any or all of the Site. Subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth above, you and Company agree and hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate State and Federal courts located in the State of Illinois, U.S.A., with respect to such matters. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Site must be filed or otherwise commenced within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
