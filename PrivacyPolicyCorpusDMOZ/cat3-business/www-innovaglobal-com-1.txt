Better Office Sound MaskingYour workers are your greatest asset. They're the face of your company, and they're the primary revenue-generating engine of your business. But studies show that the average worker is distracted up to two hours each day, and that makes it tough to focus, much less do your best work. Better Speech Privacy Technology from Speech Privacy Systems helps your workers focus on the task at hand - making your organization better at doing what it does best.Learn More about the VoiceArrest Sound Masking SystemGet a QuoteGet a No-Obligation sound masking quote and discover the dramatic privacy benefits of better office sound masking!                                                                                                                                                                               Discount quote : SPSINNOVA-01White Noise MachinesWhether it’s a noisy coworker or a noisy neighbor, intrusive noise pollution adds stress to your busy life.

Sound Masking for Small OfficesAs a small business owner, you’re constantly looking for ways to cut costs and improve your margins. And it’s those “hidden costs” that keep you up at night. You’re here because you’ve got a noise problem in your office. Odds are good it’s much more serious than simply a minor annoyance.Paying attention to your office’s acoustic environment goes way beyond feng shui. Ignoring your office acoustics actually has a strong negative impact on your bottom line. Here’s why: among professional researchers, conversational distractions are generally considered to be the biggest cause of lost productivity in open workplaces.Read MoreBenefits of Sound Masking TechnologyThe VoiceArrest™ Sound Masking System is measurably the most effective sound masking system available. Here are a few of the benefits you will enjoy as a result of new advanced technology.
Fewer Distractions & More Privacy
The primary reasons facilities employ sound masking is to reduce distractions and achieve speech privacy for confidentiality.
Reduce Distractions: workers in acoustically treated areas are more focused, better at problem-solving, more likely to make ergonomic adjustments, and experience less stress. Achieve Speech Privacy: businesses, medical facilities, churches, and law/government/military agencies often need sensitive matters to stay private. Sound masking safeguards confidential material.
The VoiceArrest Sound Masking System reduces distractions and provides speech privacy- just quieter! Anyone can mask sound with really sound, but only the VoiceArrest System can effectively do so quietly. Other masking systems must be operated at 48-51 dB in order to provide acceptable privacy conditions for most occupants. In contrats, the VoiceArrest™ Sound Masking System is normally operated at 45 dB under the same conditions.
This level of speech privacy at a lower decibel level means you get equivalent privacy but with quieter, less intrusive sound. Thus, if your application is unusual and requires greater privacy than most, you can now use the higher settings to meet those needs.
Controlled Placement of Privacy
Another fantastic benefit of the VoiceArrest Sound Masking System is the fact that it operates on Direct Field technology. Other systems function as plenum-based, meaning they are installed in the air shared above open and closed offices, often resulting in excessively built-up noise in closed offices. The only “solution” is to starve the open areas. Not ideal. In contrast, direct field systems like the VoiceArrest place the speakers directly within the ceiling tiles, thus delivering uniform, controlled speech privacy to zoned areas.
Privacy + Paging + Music
Want paging and/or music? The VoiceArrest™ Sound Masking System can also easily upgrade to add paging and/or music to your environment using the same speakers that deploy the sound masking. You will be amazed when you hear our paging system. Due to the quality of our speakers and their placement, we provide the cleanest paging in the market without the usual startle effect. Background music can be added from a wide variety of sources.
Cost Effective PrivacyThe VoiceArrest™ Speech Sound Masking System meets a compelling need by providing state-of-the-art speech privacy at a modest price. Given the technological and performance advantages the VoiceArrest™ System offers compared to the old style plenum-based systems, most people expect it to be substantially more expensive. However, typical to true disruptive technologies, these new enhancements are accomplished in a way that allows them to be offered at competitive pricing even when compared to older, less effective products.
The VoiceArrest™ Sound Masking System is even more cost-effective when compared to other methods of increasing privacy, such as upgrading ceiling tiles, adding absorbent wall panels, or raising furniture panel heights.
