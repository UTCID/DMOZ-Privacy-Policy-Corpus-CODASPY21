4. Completion of a purchase
Any orders placed by you on this Website constitute a binding offer by you to conclude a purchase with Swarovski. The binding purchase agreement comes into existence only when Swarovski accepts your order on the Website by sending you an e-mail or written communication, or by shipping the products ordered.
5. Taxes
When Swarovski is required by law to collect applicable taxes relating to your order, you authorize Swarovski to charge the applicable taxes to your selected payment method.
6. Reservations and exceptions
Swarovski reserves the right to change prices, terms, specifications and warranties for products on this Website at any time without prior notice. Swarovski attempts to post accurate information, but errors may sometimes occur. Any such errors in product specifications, descriptions, and pricing will be corrected when discovered and Swarovski reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, including after an order has been submitted. If an error in pricing is discovered after your order has been submitted, Swarovski will inform you of the error at which time you may cancel or reaffirm your order at your option.
7. Product availability
Swarovski reserves the right to limit the number of products (or the number of a particular SKU) that may be sold to a customer.
Swarovski reserves the right to reject orders from customers if there is reasonable belief that customer is in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or if customer is engaging in fraudulent or other criminal activities.
Once Swarovski accepts your order, it will attempt to promptly fill the order subject to available inventories. Should an item not be available, we kindly ask you to try back again or visit your local authorized Swarovski retailer.
8. Terms of payment
The purchase price for the products ordered by you is due upon the shipment of your order by Swarovski. Upon shipment, Swarovski will charge the selected payment method for the purchase price, the cost of shipping and handling and applicable taxes. You may not make any set off against Swarovski's claim for payment unless the amount set off is not disputed by Swarovski or has been the subject of a final and binding judgment against Swarovski.
9. Delivery and reservation of title
The products ordered by you will be delivered to either the store location requested by you or at the address entered by you through a delivery service selected by Swarovski. You agree that the products ordered and sent to you remain Swarovski's property until full payment has been received by Swarovski.
If you choose the Click & Collect option (U.S.A. customers only), we will keep your order in store for 14 calendar days after it has arrived. If the order is not collected, we will assume that it is unwanted, cancel the order and issue a refund via your original payment method.
Upon receipt the order  must be checked for accuracy and completeness.
10. Right to cancel the purchase
You may cancel this purchase for any reason up to two weeks following your receipt of the ordered products. If you cancel this purchase, Swarovski will, upon receipt of the returned products, refund or credit any payments you have made for the ordered products.
You may obtain further information and assistance concerning the return of the products ordered by selecting "MY ACCOUNT" from the Website menu. To cancel the purchase, you must send a written notice to the address specified above in paragraph 3 within two weeks of your receipt of the products, or send the products back to the following address for delivery within two weeks of your receipt of the products:
Swarovski Digital Business USA Inc.Attn: SCO Returns2 Slater RoadCranston, RI 02920
If you cancel the purchase by written notice, you must return the products to this address within 30 days of the cancellation.
In case you cancel the purchase you are responsible for the costs of and arrangements for the shipment of the products to be sent back to Swarovski. You must take reasonable care that the products are not damaged during their return.
If you decide to return only part of an order that has been purchased with a discount/offer applied, the amount refunded will be subject to the minimum purchase amount placed on the offer, the value of the discount will be adjusted accordingly, and only the amount relevant to the returned item will be refunded. If the items returned bring the remaining total below the minimum purchase level of the offer, then the discounted amount will be deducted from the refund amount. For example, a 10% discount (with a minimum purchase amount of USD 100) will be removed if the returned product(s) brings the total order value below USD 100. In case of a promotion with staggered prices, always the lowest amount will be refunded.
For items which come in a single box (“normal set”), if you wish to return any of the items within the normal set, you will have to return all the items that were part of the normal set. Swarovski will not accept returns of individual items within the normal set and will only accept returns of the entire normal set.
For bundle-promotional sets, where you enjoy a promotion or discount as a result of purchasing one or more items (e.g. buy 3 items and get 10% off each item or where savings for each product are stated), you can return any of the items purchased separately. However, in case you choose to return any items purchased as a bundled set, kindly note that Swarovski will adjust the promotional price by charging you the regular price for the remaining items that you purchased as part of the bundle. Accordingly, Swarovski will deduct from the amount to be refunded to you (i.e. the discounted price paid for the item(s) in the bundle that you have returned) the difference between the regular price and the discounted price of the remaining items in the bundle that you do not return.
11. Limited Warranty
For Swarovski in the US and the Swarovski Online Shop in the US, we offer a one year warranty for Jewelry and Accessories and a two year warranty for all other products. ANY WARRANTY IMPLIED BY STATE LAW ON THIS PRODUCT IS ALSO LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE LENGTH OF THIS EXPRESS WARRANTY. Some states, including New Jersey, do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts. Accordingly, if you live in these states, the above limitation on implied warranties does not apply to you.
