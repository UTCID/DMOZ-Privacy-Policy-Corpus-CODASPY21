SoftCafe Website Privacy Policy
At SoftCafe we are 100% committed to protecting your security and privacy. We know that when you shop online, you want to know that your name, address, and credit card details will be kept safe and secure, and we promise to do that.
All of our transactions are processed securely using Stripe, a leader in secure Internet payment processing.
Stripe's secure-server software encrypts your personal information including credit or debit card number, name and address. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code that are then securely transmitted over the Internet.
Our Mailing List
We use our mailing list a few times a year to send a newsletter or information out to our customers with new product announcements and free update notices. Any message sent to our mailing list has an unsubscribe option at the bottom for being removed from the list - just click that link and you won’t hear from us again. Or if you want to update your contact information you can notify us at our company contact page with your request.
And we promise not to pass on your personal data including your e-mail address to any third party - ever.
