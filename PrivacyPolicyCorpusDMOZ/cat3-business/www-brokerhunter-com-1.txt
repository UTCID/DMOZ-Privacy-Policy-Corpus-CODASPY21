More About Hidden (confidential) and visible (non-confidential)
We have 2 Confidentiality settings that are available to Candidates posting their Profiles on BROKERHUNTER: Hidden (confidential) and visible (non-confidential).
BROKERHUNTER.com website option – Hidden or CONFIDENTIAL:
o    For the CONFIDENTIAL setting we DO NOT display that portion of the Profile that contains the job Candidate’s name, address, phone number, resume and email address. This is only made available if the Candidate decides to release it.
o    When a CONFIDENTIAL Candidate applies to a job posting or approves contact with a firm, then personal data (including name, phone number, email, etc.) is provided to the firm. That data is made available to the firm's requesting office.
BROKERHUNTER.com website option – Visible or NON-CONFIDENTIAL
o    NON-CONFIDENTIAL Candidate Profile information is available and can be viewed by any employer/firm that is enrolled with BROKERHUNTER, so be guided accordingly when you make the decision if elect this NON-CONFIDENTIAL setting.
However, since the data is no longer under our control, we cannot accept responsibility for its misuse by the employer/firm. If you know of any instance in which information from our database is being misused or compromised, please inform us immediately.
Candidates, we recommend that, if you are concerned about Confidentiality, you not post your Profile or conduct job searches from your office computer - use your own personal computer. Your current employer, especially in the regulated securities industry, has the right to inspect outgoing and incoming email and history/usage information, which may not be what you have in mind.

About Safe Harbor
The Safe Harbor program was jointly established in June 2000 by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission, as a method for transferring personal information from the European Union (EU) to companies in the United States. The program is a voluntary self-certification process for companies operating in the United States. Companies that meet certification standards assert they are upholding privacy standards for personal information that have been jointly accepted by the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce. These standards far exceed current US privacy standards. BH has certified it is in compliance with Safe Harbor standards and requirements.
Scope
This Statement governs personal information transferred from subject countries to the United States on behalf of BH. The scope applies to personal information in on-line and off-line formats.
Safe Harbor Privacy Principles

o    Given the opportunity to keep their personal information confidential
o    Provided a unique username and password to access, update, or remove their personal information
o    Understand how to contact BH
Consistent with Safe Harbor requirements, they may be instances where BH may not be able to furnish advance notice of release of personal information. Specifically, notice is not required where the release of personal information is required by an official government inquiry; is required by applicable laws, court orders or government regulations; or is necessary to protect BH legal interests and providing such notice would interfere with those interests.
Choice:
BH will not process personal information about individuals for purposes other than those for which the information was originally obtained or subsequently authorized by the individual unless the individual affirmatively and explicitly consents ("opt-in"). BH also provides individuals with the opportunity to withdraw consent at any time ("opt-out"), in which case their personal information will no longer be available.
Data Integrity:
BH seeks to ensure that any personal information held about individuals is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained. BH collects only the personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be utilized. Individuals have a responsibility to assist BH in maintaining accurate, complete and current personal information about them. Statement (the "Statement") sets forth the privacy principles followed by BROKERHUNTER.com LLC (hereinafter referred to as 'BH') in connection with the transfer and protection of personal information received from residents of the European Union (EU), European Community (EC) and other countries adhering to the European Commission Directive on Data Protection.
