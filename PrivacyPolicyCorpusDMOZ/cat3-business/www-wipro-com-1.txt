Cookies and other technologies
A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded to a user's computer or mobile device when the user accesses certain websites. Cookies are then sent back to originating website on each subsequent visit. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. They are used for a wide variety of purposes such as website analytics – counting visitors and their behaviour, targeted advertising, recording user preferences or for authentication.
Strictly Necessary Cookies - These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
Performance cookies - These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Functionality cookies - These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Targeting Cookies - These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

Wipro discloses information to third parties only for legitimate purposes such as our service providers and agents who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of personal information and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose. Wipro will ensure through formally executed contracts that the service providers are committed to “same level of data protection” as applicable data protection laws and regulations.
Further, Wipro may make disclosures to law enforcement authorities or regulatory bodies subject to applicable law.

Disclosure of information:

It shall also take steps to ensure that the information transferred to a third party is not further disclosed by it except where permissible under law.
International transfer of Personal Information:
Wipro may transfer certain personal information across geographical borders to Wipro entities or service providers in other countries working on our behalf in accordance with applicable law.  A Transfer of personal information has a broad meaning and occurs when information is communicated, moved, accessed or otherwise sent to another country.
In cases where personal information would need to be transferred outside of a country where Wipro operates, towards other jurisdictions, specific requirements may apply for such Transfer to be allowed.
For instance, data protection laws of the EEA and of Switzerland authorize the Transfer of personal information:
to countries which have been recognized by the European Commission as offering an adequate level of protection for personal information.
if appropriate measures in compliance with the European Union data protection legal requirements are in place in order to ensure the protection and the confidentiality of personal information in the countries that do not offer an adequate level of protection.
This is the case where the recipient Wipro entity or Third Party concludes with the exporting relevant entity of Wipro an agreement based on the European Union standard contractual clauses, to ensure the protection of personal information.
Wipro may also Transfer personal information to a Third Party located outside the EEA or Switzerland without having to implement the above measures where one of the following conditions is met:
the Data Subject has given her/his consent to Wipro for the Transfer her/his Personal Information;
Wipro needs to carry out the transfer of personal information to perform or conclude a contract with the Data Subject; the transfer of personal information is necessary (i) to protect the Data Subject's vital interests (i.e. in case of a life or death situation), or  (ii) to allow Wipro to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or (iii)  for reasons of public interest;
the Transfer covers personal information publicly available (for instance from a public register).
Wipro ensures the “same level of data protection” as per applicable data protection laws and regulations when it transfers your personal information to any other body corporate or a person in any country
Authenticity:
Wipro shall not be responsible for the authenticity of the personal information supplied to it by its service providers, whose duty it is to ensure that the information provided by it or its employees is authentic.
Grievance Redressal:
Any grievance or complaint, in relation to processing of personal information, should be sent to Wipro in writing to following contact email ID. Grievance shall be redressed as expeditiously as possible.
Email: dpo-europe@wipro.com
Effective Date:
This Privacy Statement is effective from May 2018 and it supersedes all existing polices on the subject matter.
