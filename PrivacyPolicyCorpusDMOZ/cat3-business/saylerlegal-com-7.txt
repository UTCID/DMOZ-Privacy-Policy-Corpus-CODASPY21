We cannot guarantee your documents will be filed the same day, due to the volume impact at the courts. The clerks can only work so fast in reviewing/accepting/rejecting new electronic filings. If there is a problem with the documents late in the day, we may not be made aware of this until the clerks respond.
Small Claims Court – Please note that hearings on small claims matters are normally held at the Marina Branch Court. However, if the case goes to appeal, those hearings are normally held at the Monterey Branch Court. You may file your small claims documents at the Monterey Branch Court.
