MEMBERSHIP ACCOUNT, PASSWORD, AND SECURITY
If you wish to establish a membership with GBE, you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete, and accurate information as prompted by the applicable registration form.

You may not use anyone else's account at any time without the permission of the account holder.
TRIAL MEMBERSHIPS
You are limited to one trial membership in any six-month period. In the event you enroll for more than one trial membership in any six-month period, GBE reserves the right to charge you for one-month's full membership at the generally advertised subscription rate at that time.
MEMBERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUAL USE ONLY
Your membership to the GBE site is for your individual use only, and you are prohibited from using your membership for any commercial purpose. As a condition of your use of your membership, you will not use the membership for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices.

COMMODITY TRADING
WARNING: FUTURES AND OPTION TRADING INVOLVES HIGH RISKS AND YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF MONEY.
When investing in futures, you may lose more than the funds you invested. When purchasing options, you may lose all of the money you invested.
Trading on commodity futures or options involves substantial risk of loss. According to many experts, most individual investors who trade commodity futures or options lose money.
Being a successful PAPER TRADER during one time period does not mean that you will make money when you actually invest during a later time period. Market conditions constantly change.
Notice: Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over- compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Hypothetical trading results are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
GBE contains information regarding some of GBE’s successful hypothetical trades. GBE also has hypothetical trades where it lost money (not including fees and commissions). Past Results are not necessarily indicative of Future Results.
For customers trading options, the futures charts are presented for informational purposes only. They are intended to show how investing in options can depend on the underlying futures prices; specifically, whether or not an option purchaser is buying an in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money option. Furthermore, the purchaser will be able to determine whether or not to exercise his right on an option depending on how the option’s strike price compares to the underlying futures price. The futures charts are not intended to imply that option prices move in tandem with futures prices. In fact, option prices may only move a fraction of the price move in the underlying futures. In some cases, the option may not move at all or even move in the opposite direction of the underlying futures contract.
