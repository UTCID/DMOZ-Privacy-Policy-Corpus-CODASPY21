Affiliate is eligible to earn Royalties from such payments during the term of this Agreement.
For an Affiliate Customer's or Customer's transaction to qualify as an Eligible Sales Transaction, all of the following must occur:
(i)	An Affiliate Customer or Customer must place an order for Content on an Alacra Site;
(ii)	An Affiliate Customer's or Customer's order must be approved by Alacra and the Content must be processed by Alacra;

8.2	Royalties may be earned by Affiliate during the term of this Agreement in two (2) ways:
(i)	Royalties for Affiliate Customer Transactions.
For Affiliate Customers, Affiliate may earn Royalties for any and all Eligible Sales Transactions undertaken by an Affiliate Customer within the first seven (7) calendar days after a Commencement Date, whether or not such Eligible Sales Transaction occurred through Affiliate, Affiliate's Site or an Alacra Link.
(ii)	Royalties for Other Transactions.
For Customers who do not qualify as Affiliate Customers AND/OR for Eligible Sales Transactions of an Affiliate Customer that take place after seven (7) calendar days after a Commencement Date, Affiliate may earn a Royalty for the particular Eligible Sales Transaction that is a direct result of an Alacra Link on an Affiliate Site or directly through an Alacra Site.
8.3	The Royalty for each Eligible Sales Transaction, whether completed by an Affiliate Customer or Customer, shall be twenty-five percent (25%) on Net Revenue for the relevant Content purchased ("Royalty").
8.4	No Royalty will be earned or awarded by Affiliate in the event of the following:
(i)	Credit card fraud, bad debt, and credits due for cancellations or returns;
(ii)	An Affiliate Customer, Customer or Eligible Sales Transaction cannot be correctly tracked or credited by our internal ordering system.
It is Affiliate's responsibility to ensure that the Alacra Links between the Affiliate Site and the Alacra Site are properly formatted.
Alacra will pay Affiliate a Royalty only if the Affiliate Customer, Customer and Eligible Sales Transaction is tracked on our internal online ordering system from the time the Link is initiated on your Affiliate Site to the time of the completed, Eligible Sales Transaction; or
(iii)	Affiliate attempts to artificially increase the Royalties.
If Alacra determines, in our sole discretion, that Affiliate has engaged in any of the foregoing activities, Alacra may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Alacra) withhold any Royalties otherwise payable to Affiliate under this Agreement and/or immediately terminate this Agreement.
9	ACCRUAL, REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES
9.1 	Alacra shall accrue Royalties, if any, on a monthly basis for Eligible Sales Transactions in the applicable month.
At such time as the cumulative value of the Royalties accrued by Affiliate is equal to or exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000) (the "Minimum Royalty Threshold"), Alacra will begin to pay, by check, any Royalties due Affiliate.
No Royalties will be paid to Affiliate until the Minimum Royalty Threshold has accrued, and Alacra has received payment in full from Affiliate Customers and Customers for the relevant Eligible Sales Transactions.
In the event that the monthly Royalties payable to Affiliate are less than the Minimum Royalty Threshold, Alacra will hold the Royalty payment to Affiliate until the aggregate total Royalties meet or exceed the Minimum Royalty Threshold.
Payment of any Royalties to Affiliate shall be sent by check to Affiliate's main contact listed on the Program Application thirty (30) days after the close of the financial quarter in which the aggregate total Royalties accrued is equal to or exceeds the Minimum Royalty Threshold and will follow in successive quarterly intervals.
Affiliate may request that Royalties be paid by wire transfer, providing, however, that the cumulative value of the Royalties equals or exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
Alacra reserves the right to charge Affiliate for any and all wiring fees that may apply to such wire transfers.
Affiliate will be solely and entirely responsible for any and all taxes and/or other fees or obligations associated with the receipt of the Royalty under this Agreement.
9.2	Alacra shall provide Affiliate with access to certain reporting tools on a secure World Wide Website that will enable Affiliate to review statistics relating to completed, Eligible Sales Transactions and Royalties, if any, accrued by Affiliate.
Any representations or statistics provided to Affiliate through these reports regarding Eligible Sales Transactions and/or Royalties may not reflect any taxes or processing, or other applicable, fees.
Accordingly, the Royalty payment paid to Affiliate by Alacra may differ from the amount reflected in any reports made available to Affiliate by Alacra.
Alacra reserves the right to utilize the services of a third party to assist in fulfilling its tracking, reporting and or Royalty payment requirements hereunder.
9.3	 Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Royalties shall remain payable by Alacra to Affiliate in accordance with Section 12 below.
9.4	Alacra is obligated by United States federal law to obtain tax information from Program participants who are United States citizens, United States residents or United States corporations and from Program participants who are not United States citizens or residents but whose businesses are taxable in the United States.
If Alacra believes that Affiliate is a Program participant from whom we are obligated to obtain tax information and Affiliate does not provide this information to Alacra after we have requested it, Alacra may withhold Affiliate's Royalty payments until such time as Affiliate provides this information to Alacra or otherwise satisfies us that Affiliate is not a person from whom we are required to obtain tax information.
