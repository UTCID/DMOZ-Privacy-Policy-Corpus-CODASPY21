Aerofilm Systems ontwerpt, ontwikkelt en produceert luchtkussens en luchtkussen transportsystemen. Deze vorm van intern transport is de ideale oplossing om lichte tot zeer zware objecten op een veilige, ergonomische en kostenbesparende manier te verplaatsen en positioneren. Ook voor gevoelige en daarom vaak dure objecten is het ideaal, omdat luchtkussens geen trillingen veroorzaken tijdens verplaatsing.
