APO/FPOAPO / FPO Shipping TermsThere is no tracking option available for APO/FPO shipments.To ship to an APO/FPO address, our warehouse must ship your order to our Orange offices and repackage them for re-shipping. This is why our rates to APO/FPO addresses have a shipping charge (our actual shipping cost) plus $25.00 handling fee (waived on orders greater than $500.00).When shipping to an APO/FPO address, we will need to calculate the shipping charges by working with the APO/FPO carrier. You will be notified via email or phone of the shipping charges; per our policy, we will not ship the order until we receive your authorization.For APO/FPO shipments, any delivery time estimate that you receive is based on delivery to the stateside APO/FPO box address.We will do our best to make this a smooth process when shipping to APO/FPO addresses. We are aware that military personnel are not able to check their email as often as others and we will do our best to handle things on our end without further correspondence from our military customers.If you are a repeat customer and need a shipment handled quickly, please pre-authorize additional shipping charges if possible by stating that you authorize any additional shipping charges in the "Special Instructions" field on the checkout page. This will greatly reduce email correspondence and avoid any delays in shipment.We apologize for the inconvenience, however this is the only method available to us at this time to ship to APO/FPO addresses.APO/FPO orders are typically shipped via USPS Priority Mail Insured or USPS Parcel Post Insured.
