If delivery is expected to take more than 2-3 weeks, we will ask for your confirmation, and we will take the payment after you have confirmed that this is O.K.
We will take payment from your account only when the products are ready for shipment.
We will inform you of the shipping details, including the shipment consignment number, so that you can track your order.

Returns, Faulty Items, and Unwanted Items
Note: do not return faulty or unwanted items to us without first obtaining a returns number. We are not responsible for any items that are returned to us if no returns number has been given to us.
To return unwanted, incorrect, or faulty items back to us, you will first need to obtain a Returns Number by emailing us at sales@sparksdirect.co.uk with the details of your order and the reason you want to return the item/s. Please note, we do not take back unwanted light bulbs or LED lamps or LED drivers / drivers (unless they are faulty), nor can we take back any electronic items or items that are clearly marked as non-returnable (please see the description of the items before purchase).
Damaged Items
If the items you have received are faulty or damaged, you have the obligation to notify us by email as soon as possible.
If the items you have bought are damaged, we will replace them. If the items become faulty within 30 days, we will replace them free of charge. After the 30 days period, you will have to send them back to us, and we will replace them (you will be responsible for the carriage charge).
Damaged items can be either refunded or replaced; in either case, please contact us to obtain a returns number and upon receipt and inspection, and we will replace or refund the faulty fitting. If the item is found not to be faulty or misused beyond the limits of everyday use, the items will be returned and you will be responsible for the carriage costs.
Faulty Items
According to the Distance Selling Regulations (Sale of Goods Act), we at Sparks offer a 30-day no-quibble returns guarantee; if the items are faulty within 30 calendar days from receiving them, you can return them for a full refund or for replacement.
If the items you have received are faulty or damaged, you have the obligation to notify us by email as soon as possible.
In all cases, the manufacturer's guarantee passes to the end-user. If the items are damaged or faulty after 30 days, we will pass on the manufacturer's contact details, so that you can resolve the issue with them directly.
Please note: Faulty items may need to be returned to the manufacturer for testing - if the items are found faulty, we will replace the item free of charge; if they are not found faulty, a minimum charge of £10 + VAT will be incurred to cover delivery costs.
Unwanted Items
If within 30 days from receiving your order you decide you do not want the items you ordered, please contact us by email to obtain a returns number (you will support the carriage expenses). The original carriage charge will not be refunded.
A returns number must be obtained and sent or brought with the returned items.
The unwanted items must be in their original packaging; we reserve the right to deny the refund if the items are not in a re-saleable condition.
If the items you ordered are on a special order, if they are customised for you, or they are on orders where there was no carriage charge, there will be a 15% handling charge applied. In the instance where the carriage charge was not charged, this will be deducted from the total.
If the items you ordered clearly state in their description that they are non-returnable, then we cannot take them back for a refund.
If No-One is Home to Receive the Parcel
Two attempts will be made by the courier to deliver the parcel/s. After the second attempt no-one is home to receive the parcel/s, the parcel/s will be returned to us. Any parcels that are returned due to non-delivery will incur a charge of £15 + VAT. If you would like us to send it to you again, you will be charged a further £6.00 + VAT for the carriage of the redelivery.
In-Store Pickup
After 90 days, if the order is still not picked up in our store and there is no communication, we cannot be held responsible for the items on your order (they may be disposed of with no refund of the order).
