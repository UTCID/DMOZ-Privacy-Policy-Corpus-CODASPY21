Major Card Data Breaches
When major merchants indicate their stores may have experienced card breaches, you can usually find up-to-date information on the merchant's website.
At Home Savings Bank we continue to monitor these situations carefully. You may call customer service at
608.282.6000
with questions or concerns about your account.
Customers are protected by their banks when these point-of sale breaches happen, regardless of where the breach actually occurred. Per Visa regulation, financial institutions are required to take a variety of steps to protect customer's accounts.
Being Proactive Helps Protect Your Card
Here are steps you can take to help protect your card:
Review your account history online and look for suspicious transactions.
If there are suspicious transactions on the account, please report them immediately to the bank or credit card company.
If you would like to get a new debit card/credit card, please call Home Savings Bank customer service at
