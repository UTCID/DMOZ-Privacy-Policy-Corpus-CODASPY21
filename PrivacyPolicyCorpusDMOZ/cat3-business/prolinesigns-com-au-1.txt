Privacy Film & Window Frosting
Privacy film and frosted window signage are an ideal way of advertising whilst maintaining visibility and light. Whether to increase privacy or have subtle brand continuity throughout the building, Proline Signs’  window frosting can be customised to suit your requirements. Bands of frosting emblazoned with your logo or message can be applied to windows giving a private one-way vision effect.
Proline Signs can customise your frosted windows to include colour effects, window lettering or large format digital images. We also create one way vision by using perforated adhesive back vinyl so that visibility is maintained for only one side of the glass. This can also be used for vehicle windows.
Talk to our team to find a window signage solution that suits your specific requirements.
