Safeguarding your personal information
Please be assured that we will protect the confidentiality of any personal information we may acquire about you. We will not sell or rent information about you to anyone. However, we may disclose personal information to our affiliates, third party service providers or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
Information we collect from our website
Any information you enter into our website will be treated as personal information. Personal information may include your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as well as other information. We may also collect information about how you use our website. We may obtain this information by tracking when you use our Website, which pages you view at which times and similar data through our web server software and “cookies”.
Our use of cookies
A cookie is a small data file that a website can send to the browser on your computer when you link to that website. It is not a computer program. A cookie does not extract personal information about you, such as your name and address, from your computer. It does not read data on your hard drive or instruct your computer to perform any function.
A cookie sent to your browser from our website can be used by the website’s server software to recognize your computer whenever you subsequently log onto the website. A cookie may also be used to assemble information about your usage patterns, such as how frequently you log in to the website and which pages you use, when and for how long.

You may also be able to use your browser or other software to clear cookies from your hard drive any time you wish. However, deleting a website’s cookie may mean that the website will not recognize you as a repeat user.

Your browser will indicate when you are within a secure area of our Website by displaying a symbol, such as a locked padlock or an unbroken key. Encryption technology scrambles transmissions so it is incomprehensible to third parties. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Internet transmissions cannot be made absolutely secure. We will not be liable for the unintended disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of or breaches of security by third parties.
