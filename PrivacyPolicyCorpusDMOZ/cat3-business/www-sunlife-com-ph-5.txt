Protect your Data
Did you know that over 9,000,000,000[1] records in the world have been lost or stolen since 2013? The famous Comeleak incident alone accounted for 77,736,795[2] in that total number. Thieves, fraudsters and hackers have become ultra-sophisticated these days that even the most cautious companies have become their victims. They are always ready to attack - while you are opening an account, paying your bills or merely surfing the net.
Although there is no guarantee that data breaches will not happen, we can adopt measures to minimize our risk. Sun Life ensures that we have adequate controls to keep your records with us secure. You can also do your share to help us protect your data. Here are some ways:
Take extra precaution when using wireless connections, especially the free ones. They may cost you more. Did you know that many hotspots in public areas like airports, hotels and restaurants reduce their security so it is easier for individuals to access and use their networks? [3]
Check if the website you are surfing is secure. Look at the address bar of the website to determine if it begins with "https" rather than "http". "Https" indicates that the website is secure.
Strengthen your passwords and change them regularly. According to a Slovakian IT security company, the recent Yahoo breach revealed that the most common passwords used are"123456" and "password".[4] Do not set your name and birthdate as your passwords. Vary your passwords across different websites and change them on a regular basis.
Do not click on any suspicious mail, especially if it requests you to provide some personal information. Be wary of fraudulent calls and texts. Most phishing attacks come in the form of calls, emails, posts and SMS that promise you a freebie or a prize in exchange for your personal data!
Maximize the use of alerts – Take advantage of facilities that notify you if your credit card, debit card or other accounts have been used or accessed.
Use social media wisely. Do not include personal information such as birth date, mother's maiden name, contact number and other similar information in your profile. Reconsider changing the setting of your social media accounts especially if they are open to the public.
Utilize different cards for online shopping, standard bills and physical shopping. Some banks issue an e-credit card linked to your physical credit card for online transactions bearing a different number and code.
Review your account and policy statements and notices regularly for any unusual transaction.
Do not over-share your personal information!  Think twice if someone is asking for your name, phone number, email address, postal address or birthdate for no clear reason.
Report breaches immediately. If your policy contract, policy/account statement or credit/debit card has been lost or stolen, notify the related company the soonest. Be quick to change your password and/or pin or block your card as applicable. Call our Client Care, SUNLINK, at 8849-9888 or email us at sunlink@sunlife.com if you believe that your account or information has been compromised.
Shred your documents.  Do not just toss your policy/account statements and official receipts into the bin. Information contained in these statements, receipts or other documents may be used to enable account take-over or commit fraud.

Let's outsmart the thieves out there. By not giving an opportunity, there is lesser chance of falling prey to them!
