5.How we use what we collect
We use information about you to:
Present site content effectively to you.
Provide information, products and services that you request, or (with your consent) which we think may interest you.
Carry out our contracts with you.
Allow you to use our interactive services if you want to.
Tell you our charges.
Tell you about other goods and services that might interest you. We will also let other people do this, and we (or they) may contact you.
If you are already our customer, we will only contact you electronically about things similar to what was previously sold to you.
If you are a new customer, you will only be contacted if you agree to it.
If you don't want to be contacted for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box that you will find on screen.
Please note: We don't identify individuals to our advertisers, but we do give them aggregate information to help them reach their target audience, and we may use information we have collected to display advertisements to that audience.
In addition, if you don’t want us to use your personal data for any of the other reasons set out in this section in 5, you can let us know at any time by contacting us at [Email Address], and we will delete your data from our systems. However, you acknowledge this will limit our ability to provide the best possible [products and] services to you.
In some cases, the collection of personal data may be a statutory or contractual requirement, and we will be limited in the [products and] services we can provide you if you don’t provide your personal data in these cases.
6.Where we store your data
We may transfer your collected data to storage outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may be processed outside the EEA to fulfil your order and deal with payment.
By giving us your personal data, you agree to this arrangement. We will do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure.
Payment will be encrypted. If we give you a password, you must keep it confidential. Please don't share it. Although we try to provide protection, we cannot guarantee complete security for your data, and you take the risk that any sending of that data turns out to be not secure despite our efforts.
We only keep your personal data for as long as we need to in order to use it as described above in section 5, and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it. In any event, we will conduct an [annual] review to ascertain whether we need to keep your personal data. Your personal data will be deleted if we no longer need it.
7.Disclosing your information
We are allowed to disclose your information in the following cases:
We can disclose it if we have a legal obligation to do so, or in order to protect other people's property, safety or rights.
We can exchange information with others to protect against fraud or credit risks.
We may contract with third parties to supply services to you on our behalf. These may include payment processing, search engine facilities, advertising and marketing. In some cases, the third parties may require access to some or all of your data. These are the third parties that have access to your information:
Kantar (media monitoring – member benefit)
Communicate (industry media – member benefit)
PR Moment (industry media – member benefit)
WIPR (independent group – administration)
GWIPR (independent group – administration)
Question and Retain (research - internal)
The Pulse Business (research - internal)
Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the obligations of the third party under GDPR and the law.
8.Your rights
In a majority of instances, our justification for processing your personal data will be consent or legitimate interests. The former can be managed here, the latter will be highlighted along with an opt-out, and both are done in line with the ICO’s best practice.
Under the GDPR, you have the right to:
request access to, deletion of or correction of, your personal data held by us at no cost to you;
request that your personal data be transferred to another person (data portability);
be informed of what data processing is taking place;
restrict processing;
to object to processing of your personal data; and
complain to a supervisory authority.
