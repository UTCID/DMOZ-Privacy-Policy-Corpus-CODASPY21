Mentoring Complete Privacy Policy
At Mentoring Complete, we’re committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to our websites: Mentoringcomplete.comMentoringuniversity.comand Subscription Services and governs our data collection, processing, and usage practices. By using our Websites and Subscription Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Websites or Subscription Services.Note: We periodically update this Privacy Policy, so please occasionally check it for any revisions. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please don't hesitate to contact us. How our Subscription Service WorksWe use an online subscription service through HubSpot. To understand how HubSpot's subscription service works, we're quoting directly from HubSpot's privacy page regarding this matter:"Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and HubSpot itself) to build marketing webpages on our servers where visitors can learn more about the company, download content, and provide their contact information and other demographic information. This information, which is stored and managed on our service providers' servers, is then used so that the visitors can be contacted about their interest in the company's goods or services and interact with the company. HubSpot provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing and lead generation, and we use it on our Websites for our own marketing and lead generation." – HubSpot privacy policyHubSpot's agreement with Management Mentors, Inc. prohibits us from using the Subscription Service to collect, manage, or process Sensitive Information. "Sensitive Information" refers to credit or debit card numbers, personal financial account information, Social Security numbers, Social Insurance numbers, passport numbers, driver's license numbers or similar personal identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health condition or information, or other financial or health information.NOTE: HubSpot is NOT responsible for the information we collect. In other words, if you have a problem with our Websites or Subscription Services, blame us, not HubSpot.Information We CollectWhile you don't need to provide any information in order to explore and enjoy our Websites, we do collect Navigational Information.In addition, we sometimes request that you provide Personal Information when you're seeking certain things from us (like our downloadable white papers, for example)."Navigational Information" refers to information about your computer and your visits to this website, such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, and pages viewed."Personal Information" refers to any information that you voluntarily submit to us and that identifies you personally, including contact information, such as your name, email address, company name, address, phone number, and other information about yourself or your business. Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into via the Websites, and information about you that is publicly available on the Internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google, or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers.Information about Children Our Websites and Subscription Services are not intended for or targeted at children under 13, and we do not knowingly or intentionally collect information about children under 13.

In other words, we won't sell your information to a company so that they can market to you.That said, if we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by our Websites and the Subscription Services.We use your personal information to make your web experience better.In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Information to improve your browsing experience by personalizing the Websites and to improve the Subscription Services with more targeted content.If you choose to download something from our site (or some similar action), you will need to provide, at the very least, an email address.
