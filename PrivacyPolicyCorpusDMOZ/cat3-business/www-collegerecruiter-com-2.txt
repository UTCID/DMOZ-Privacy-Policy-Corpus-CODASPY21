1. Introduction
Welcome to the websites and online services of College Recruiter, Inc. ("College Recruiter," "we," or "us"). These Terms of Use are a contract between College Recruiter Inc. and yourself, and explain the terms and conditions by which you may use and/or access our services and websites, including, but not limited to www.CollegeRecruiter.com and any other College Recruiter-owned sites and applications (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use agreement (the, "Agreement"), whether or not you are a registered user, partner, or customer of the Services. This Agreement incorporates the College Recruiter Privacy Policy and any other Specific Terms of Service as applicable.
We reserve the right to amend this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy and any Specific Terms of Service) at any time by notifying you as provided in this Agreement. Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms of this Agreement, do not use or access (or continue to access), the Services. This Agreement applies to all persons and entities who visit any of our websites and/or use or access any of the Services ("Users").
THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES, TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEED IN COURT. THE DISPUTES/ARBITRATION PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION. DO NOT ACCESS OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY.
Certain features of the Services may also have their own specific terms and conditions that you agree to when you sign up for that particular product, function, or service ("Specific Terms of Service"). A Specific Terms of Service supplements this Agreement, but if any term of this Agreement expressly conflicts with any term of a Specific Terms of Service, the conflicting term in the Specific Terms of Service will control but only with respect to the applicable product, function or service. All other terms and conditions in both this Agreement and the Specific Terms of Service will remain in force.
Types of Users:
The word "you" as used in this agreement will apply to visitors who browse College Recruiter websites and individuals who access and use the Services on their own behalf and/or on behalf of an entity.
Users that use the Services to search for employees, view resumes, profiles, or curriculum vitae, and/or post and/or distribute job openings ("Job Advertisements"), on behalf of themselves and/or a third party are also referred to in this Agreement as, a "Client".
If you use College Recruiter on behalf of an employer, organization, agency, institution, or other entity, then (a) "you" includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity's behalf
In addition to the rest of this Agreement, please review the terms of Section 9 carefully if you are using the Services as a Client.
If you use the Services to register for job alerts by email or any other method made available to you, or to upload your resumé or CV, or to search for or apply to Job Advertisements, we refer to you as, a "Job Seeker".
In addition to the other provisions of this Agreement, please review the terms of Section 8 carefully if you are using the Services as a Job Seeker
2. USE OF THE SERVICES
A. Eligibility
You must be a resident of the United States of America. We provide non-USA country and other geographic options to those registering only for the convenience of the user who resides in the USA but who prefer to use an address in another country to facilitate their interaction with Clients and other users. By way of example, a resident of Pennsylvania who is seeking an internship or educational opportunity in China may prefer to use a mailing address in China if they feel it would increase the likelihood of the employer or school accepting their application.
You must also be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction, whichever is older, in which you reside so that you can form a binding contract with College Recruiter.
You may not use the Services if your use of the Services has been previously terminated or suspended by College Recruiter unless we provided you with specific written authorization to re-use the Services.

3. USER CONTENT AND USERS
The Services may allow Users to post and/or provide content that may be viewable by other Users, including, but not limited to, Job Advertisements, company information, a job seeker's application information, content of messages, resumes/CVs, logos, trademarks, comments, questions, and other content or information ("User Content").
User Content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that provided the User Content. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, providing or publishing it.
The following list is intended to be illustrative of the types of User Content that is prohibited, but is not an exhaustive list: You agree not to post or provide User Content that (i) may create a risk of harm to any person or property; (ii) provides instructional information about illegal activities; (iii) involves the transmission of junk or unsolicited mail or other communications, 'phishing' or 'scamming'; (iv) provides links to material that is illegal or offensive, or targets or solicits personal information from, anyone under the age of 18; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party's trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (viii) contains any information or content that is false or misleading; or (ix) violates the Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy of any third party. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property Rights" means patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction. If you are a Client providing or submitting Job Advertisements, you further agree that such content will not contain any personally identifiable information including but not limited to email addresses and phone numbers.
You agree that College Recruiter makes no representations, warranties, promises or guarantees regarding any content provided or generated by third parties, including, without limitation, the content of messages, Job Advertisements and resumés. You further agree that College Recruiter acts as a passive conduit for the distribution, provision, and publication of User Content, and has no obligation to screen or verify the accuracy, legality, legitimacy, truthfulness, or completeness of User Content, and accordingly, you accept that College Recruiter is not responsible and has no liability, for User Content. You understand that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, incomplete, illegal, misleading, false, offensive, constitutes spam, or is otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you accept that it is your responsibility to verify the quality, accuracy, truthfulness, legality or reliability of User Content, including, without limitation, resumes/CVs and Job Advertisements and content of messages and to immediately notify College Recruiter in writing at support@CollegeRecruiter.com should you become aware of any User Content that may be inaccurate, incomplete, illegal, misleading, false, offensive, constitutes spam, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose. Your reliance on any User Content is at your own risk.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, although College Recruiter has no obligation to screen User Content, to the extent that College Recruiter becomes or is made aware of, User Content that may or does (i) violate the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement you have with College Recruiter, or (ii) violate any law or regulation, or (iii) violate the rights of third parties, or (iv) create liability for College Recruiter or otherwise negatively impact College Recruiter, College Recruiter reserves the right to reject and/or remove such User Content, and suspend and/or terminate any User Account associated with such User Content.
Please note Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act ("CDA") (and the equivalent or similar laws in your jurisdiction), which are intended to exclude or limit the liability of online service providers such as College Recruiter, which provide or make available access to third-party user generated content (see § 230 (c)(1) which states: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider).
The decision by College Recruiter to remove or not post or distribute any User Content, does not by itself amount to participation in the creation of such User Content and accordingly, does not constitute a waiver of the immunity afforded by the CDA. Additionally, § 230 (c)(2) of the CDA specifically provides: "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.."
You understand and agree that College Recruiter does not, and cannot, confirm that each User is who he/she/they claim to be. We are not responsible for authenticating Users and therefore it is your responsibility to conduct the appropriate due diligence before communicating or interacting with other Users, including, without limitation, Job Seekers, employers, staffing agencies, and recruiters. You assume all risks associated with Users with whom you come into contact. If you have any disputes or issues with any User you agree to pursue any remedies directly with the applicable User and you release College Recruiter, its subsidiaries, and their respective employees, directors and agents from all claims, demands and damages of every kind (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
College Recruiter reserves the right to disclose User Content and any information related to the provider of such User Content, to third parties in connection with the operation and provision of the Services, to enforce the terms of any agreement that we have with you, to comply with legal obligations and requests from governmental authorities, law enforcement agencies, court orders, subpoenas, etc., and to protect the interests of College Recruiter where necessary. For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that we have the right to disclose your identity to a third party who is claiming that any User Content you posted, provided or uploaded is fraudulent, false, or misleading or constitutes a violation of the law, or a violation of their intellectual property or ownership rights, or of their right to privacy.
4. USER CONTENT LICENSE GRANT
By posting, submitting, providing and/or otherwise making available any User Content, you expressly grant, and represent that you have a right to grant, to College Recruiter, a royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sublicensees), perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, sell, reproduce, adapt, translate, sublicense, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works from and otherwise exploit, all such User Content in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for the purposes of posting such User Content on the College Recruiter websites, distributing such User Content through the College Recruiter distribution and publishing network and in job alerts to job seekers, and to promote College Recruiter and the Services. This license continues even if you stop using the Services.
If you are a Client, you acknowledge and agree that College Recruiter has no obligation, and may be unable, to remove your Job Advertisements and other content (including any logos and/or trademarks contained therein) once they have been (i) distributed via the College Recruiter distribution and publisher network, (ii) listed in search engine results, or (iii) distributed on websites and in job alert emails, or (iv) incorporated into fixed media displays of College Recruiter or any third party, and in each case (i) to (iv) above, the license grant from you above will be perpetual and irrevocable for such uses. To the extent your User Content is a trademark, trade name, service mark or service name protected by law, the foregoing license also extends to the use by College Recruiter to identify you as a User of the Services in any promotional and marketing materials to promote College Recruiter and the Services. Further, to the extent you have given College Recruiter the right to access certain User Content that is present on another website or service you own or control, you give College Recruiter the right to scrape such website as required to retrieve such User Content for use on the Services as contemplated in the license grants above.
You represent and warrant that you have the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights described in this section to User Content that you submit, provide, make available or post, via the Services, that the use by College Recruiter of your User Content will not violate any law or infringe the rights of any third party, and that your User Content and any other information that you provide to us is legal, complete, legitimate, truthful and accurate.
5. OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
With the exception of content owned by, or licensed from, third parties, the Services and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and content (the, "College Recruiter Content"), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of College Recruiter. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under, any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any materials or content accessible on the Services.

Accordingly, you understand and accept that College Recruiter will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, commercialize and exploit the Feedback as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind and without compensation to you. You agree not to provide any Feedback that is false or misleading or that breaches any agreement you have with a third party.
6. PAID SERVICES
A. Billing Policies
Certain aspects of the Services may be provided for a fee. If you elect to use paid features of the Services, you agree to the pricing and payment terms for the applicable Services, as we may update them from time to time. Recurring charges, at our option, may be billed in advance of service. College Recruiter may add new services and products for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion. We may also provide certain services via our third-party partners and you agree that your use of such third-party services is subject to the contractual (including payment) terms presented by such third parties should you wish to use their services. You further agree that College Recruiter has no responsibility for such third-party services and your use of such services is entirely at your own risk. Any change to the fees for paid services shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you.
B. No Refunds
You may cancel your subscription to paid services at any time and you accept that you will not receive a refund of pre-paid fees for such cancellation. In the event that College Recruiter suspends, limits, conditions, or terminates your access to the Services and/or your account due to your breach of this Agreement or any other agreement that you have with College Recruiter, you understand and accept that you will not receive a refund for any unused time with respect to fees that you have pre-paid for a subscription plan, product or service, and to the extent that you have not paid the applicable fees, you will remain liable to pay College Recruiter the entire fees due for the subscription, product or service, as applicable.
C. Payment Information; Taxes; Delinquent Payments
All information that you provide in connection with a monetary transaction must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred and in USA currency using checks, credit cards, debit cards, Automated Clearing House transactions, wires, or other financial instruments through your USA bank or other financial institution. You will also pay any applicable taxes relating to such transactions. If at any time College Recruiter is required by a taxing authority to pay any taxes not previously collected from you, you will promptly submit such taxes (including applicable penalties and interest, if any) to College Recruiter upon written notice.
If you elect to add additional paid services or products to your selected subscription or upgrade your subscription, we will invoice you for such services, products and upgrades, and/or charge your credit or debit card (or other payment method) accordingly.
Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by College Recruiter in collecting delinquent amounts, except where the delinquent amounts are due to billing inaccuracies. In addition, if you are late in payment of any fees, we reserve the right to either (i) immediately suspend or terminate your access to the applicable Services without notice, and in the event of any such suspension or termination, you will remain responsible for the entire amount of fees owing for such Services; or (ii) bill your credit/debit card on file with us under this or any other agreement. Unless your subscription plan is terminated timely and correctly, you will continue to accrue charges even if you don't use the subscribed Services.
D. Credit and Debit Cards
In the event that you pay for any Services using a credit card or debit card, you authorize College Recruiter to charge your credit or debit card (or other acceptable payment method that you have chosen from those offered) ("Payment Method"), for the applicable fees for the duration of the applicable term of your selected subscription plan or other paid service or product, together with any applicable VAT, sales, use, excise, consumption or other similar tax applicable to the Services. You represent that you are authorized to use the Payment Method on your company's behalf and you agree to accept an electronic record of a receipt. If at any time your Payment Method will not accept the charge for fees due, you agree that College Recruiter may suspend or terminate your access to the applicable Services and that you will continue to remain liable for the full payment for such Services even after your access to the Services has been terminated or suspended. By providing any Payment Method, you agree that applicable credit card, debit card and billing information may be shared with third parties such as payment processors and credit agencies, and/or collection agencies for the purposes of checking your credit, effecting payment, collecting payments and late fees if applicable, and for providing the applicable Services to you or in order to enforce our agreement with you. We may also share this information with law enforcement authorities and in response to subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants.
E. Free Trials and Subscription Services (for Client that have not executed a paper contract)
(i) Free Trial. If you have been offered a free trial to the job posting Services ("Free Trial"), you may be required to: (a) select a desired subscription plan ("Subscription Plan") and (b) provide valid credit card/debit card and billing information. Your credit/debit card will not be charged until the expiration of the Free Trial (if you don't cancel before the end of the Free Trial). You can cancel at any time during the Free Trial by calling us at 952.848.2211. You may also send us an email at sales@CollegeRecruiter.com. It is your responsibility to timely cancel your Free Trial prior to the expiration of the term of the Free Trial to avoid any unwanted charges. Once your Free Trial is cancelled you will lose access to information regarding candidates, Job Advertisements and other features of the applicable Subscription Plan. If you don't cancel prior to the end of the Free Trial term, we will automatically charge your debit/credit card for the first 30 days (if, for example, you are on a monthly Subscription Plan) or the first year (if you chose an annual Subscription Plan) or other applicable recurring period depending on the selected Subscription Plan ("Initial Plan Term"). We will continue to charge your debit/credit card at the beginning of the applicable renewal period following the Initial Plan Term unless you notify College Recruiter that you do not wish to renew prior to the end of the Initial Plan Term.
(ii) Subscription Plans and Renewals. Subscription Plans will automatically renew for recurring periods depending on the duration of your selected Subscription Plan (e.g., every 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, annual or other period), unless you notify College Recruiter of any changes or requests not to renew (i.e., to cancel), prior to the end of the Initial Plan Term (each, a "Renewal Plan Term") or each Renewal Plan Term. Cancellation requests should be made in accordance with the instructions provided on the applicable College Recruiter website or in accordance with Section 7 E. (iii) below. At the time of automatic renewal, if you have provided a credit or debit card, the applicable subscription or other fees will be charged to the debit or credit card provided and/or associated with your account, or you will be invoiced for payment.
(iii) Cancellation. For paid Subscription Plans, you may cancel at any time effective at the end of the Initial Plan Term or any Renewal Plan Term by calling us at 952.848.2211. You may also send us an email at sales@CollegeRecruiter.com, and one of our representatives will contact you.

You agree and accept that you will not receive any refund if you request a cancellation and that the cancellation request shall become effective at the end of the Initial Plan Term or Renewal Plan Term in which the cancellation notice is received by College Recruiter.

College Recruiter can suspend or terminate your access to the Services and/or this Agreement in the following instances: (i) if you breach this Agreement and cannot correct the breach within that period required by College Recruiter if the breach is capable of cure; (ii) immediately, if you fail to pay any monies owed to College Recruiter for paid services or if you become the subject of a bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar proceeding; (iii) immediately in the event of recurring violations of this Agreement; and (iv) for convenience via email notification to you and in the event of such termination for convenience, you will receive a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid fees pertaining to Services paid for, but not provided, for the balance of the applicable term of your then-current Subscription Plan. In the event of any termination or suspension of your access to the Services and/or termination of this Agreement or any other agreement you have with College Recruiter (other than a termination for convenience by College Recruiter as described in such agreements), you remain responsible for the entire amount of the fees pertaining to the applicable Services. College Recruiter may suspend your access to the Services without notice in the event of a suspected violation of this Agreement. You may terminate this Agreement if College Recruiter materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure the breach within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from you, which notice must be emailed to: sales@CollegeRecruiter.com. Pre-paid fees are non-refundable, except in the case of an uncured material breach by College Recruiter, in which case you will receive a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid fees pertaining to Services paid for, but not provided, for the balance of the applicable term of your then-current Subscription Plan.
7. ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO JOB SEEKERS
As a Job Seeker, you can (i) use the Services to search for jobs, (ii) apply for jobs ("Job Applications"), (iii) receive job alert emails, where such features are available to you ("Job Alerts"), and (iv) include your resume and other applicable information in the Resume Database. For purposes of this Agreement, references to "resume" or "CV" shall also mean a curriculum vitae, profile, references, recommendations, and other similar written overviews or assessments of a person's experience and qualifications.
You agree that if you have a College Recruiter account or if you have provided your resume/CV to College Recruiter and/or if you have signed up for job alerts, we may use the information you provide to send you information about Job Advertisements that may be of interest to you and you also agree that we may provide your resume/CV (to the extent that you have not designated it as private), to an employer, recruiter, or other entity who may be interested in candidates who have shown an interest in roles similar to the type advertised on College Recruiter, that you searched for, or that you applied to.
To the extent that you wish us to share your information and resume/CV with potential employers, recruiters, staffing agencies, or other Clients and partners (including but not limited where you have submitted your resume/CV to the Resume Database or because you have applied to a Job Advertisement on a College Recruiter website), you consent to our sharing your resume/CV, together with any additional information you provide to us during the application process. This means that you give us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license (and right to sub-license), of any rights, including intellectual property rights, in your resume/CV and any additional information you provide to us, to share or otherwise use such resume/CV and additional information.
A. Job Applications in General
You can choose how to submit your Job Application using the options offered through the Services. If you elect to apply through a third-party account such as Facebook or LinkedIn.com, you will be asked to log-in to the applicable account, and the profile, resume and other information that you have provided as part of any of those accounts will then be provided to the entity that posted the applicable Job Advertisement.
Once you submit a Job Application, your resume and other applicable information will be shared with the entity that posted the Job Advertisement. You should therefore ensure that the information you provide is complete and accurate, and only contains information that you are comfortable sharing.
If you ask College Recruiter to submit a message to any employer or third party or if you apply for a job using the Services, you accept that College Recruiter does not guarantee that the recipient entity will receive, access, view, or respond to your requests or Job Applications, or that the transmission of data will be error-free. Any screener questions provided by the entity posting a Job Advertisement are entirely in the control of that entity and if you require alternate screener questions or application process, you must contact the applicable entity directly.
B. Applying to Job Advertisements on a College Recruiter Website
When you apply to a Job Advertisement on a College Recruiter website, we will send the resume associated with your account (to the extent an account was created as described in Section 7.C. below).
IMPORTANT: It is your responsibility to ensure that the resume associated with your account is always updated, current and accurate before you apply to a Job Advertisement so an employer receives the most up-to-date information about you. If you have opted in to the Resume Database, make sure that employers see the most up-to-date information about you. In order to delete old resumes, edit your resume, or upload a new resume, please go to the Profile settings in your User account.
C. Account Creation.
In addition to your ability to manually create a College Recruiter account yourself, a College Recruiter account will automatically be created for you in the following circumstances if you don't already have an account:
When you sign up for job alerts with College Recruiter;
When you apply to a Job Advertisement on a College Recruiter website, using for example, the 'Apply Now' or 'Quick Apply' buttons; or
When you opt-in to the resume database.
When an account is automatically created for you, you will receive an email with your user name (which is usually your email address) and a link to reset your password. Whether or not you choose to reset your password, the account will exist under your email address and the resume associated with the action you took (e.g., applying for a job, signing-up for job alerts, etc.), will be connected with that account. So, before applying to a Job Advertisement, please ensure that your resume is up-to-date so that employers receive the most recent information about you.
If you do not wish to have an active College Recruiter account, please contact support@CollegeRecruiter.com or go to your account settings and inactivate your account. Note that the inactivation of your account may not delete any of your data but may, at our discretion, only prevent you from logging into or otherwise using your account.
D. Job Alerts
You can manually sign up to receive job alerts by email. In addition to a manual sign up, if you apply to Job Advertisements on a College Recruiter website and/or create an account, you also consent to receiving email job alerts based on the type of role you selected. You can edit or change the type of job alerts want to receive by following the instructions in the job alert. You may opt out of job alerts by clicking on the unsubscribe link in your job alert email.
E. Resume Database
College Recruiter has a feature which permits job seekers to include their resume/CV and other applicable information in a resume database (the, "Resume Database") to be stored on the service and potentially to be accessed by employers.
If you have added your resume/CV to the Resume Database, you consent to College Recruiter matching words, skills, or certifications that are present or implied in your resume or other application materials to words, skills, or certifications present or implied in a Job Advertisement or an employer's or recruiter's search of terms, and if there are any matches, to present matching resumes/CVs to the applicable employer, recruiter, or other Client and to send information to you that may be of interest to you.
If you submit a resume/CV, you acknowledge that we may 'parse' the resume and other applicable information into another format to create a profile view and/or enable searchable text for a Company; the Company may also be able to see your resume in the form in which you originally submitted it to College Recruiter.
F. Interactions with Other Users; Scams; Confidentiality
You are solely responsible for your interactions with Users whom you contact or who contact you. Note: there are risks, including, but not limited to, the risk of physical harm, that may arise when dealing with strangers, including persons who may be acting under false pretenses. You should therefore use caution with regard to the information you elect to share as part of your User Profile or Job Application or resume/CV that. Only list the contact information that you are comfortable disclosing to Clients and other Users of the Services.
In addition to carefully reviewing this section and Section 3 above, you should conduct your own due diligence on potential employers and Job Advertisements that may be of interest to you. As mentioned in Section 3, College Recruiter does not authenticate Users or guarantee that a Job Advertisement is suitable, legitimate or real. If you are concerned about any particular communication you have received from a potential employer (either because it's unsolicited or you received the communication in response to your Job Application), or if you are concerned about any particular Job Advertisement you find on College Recruiter, or if you find a Job Advertisement that is fake or fraudulent, you should do the following:
Contact College Recruiter immediately at support@CollegeRecruiter.com and do not respond to the sender of the communication; and concurrently,
Conduct your own Internet search of the company and the person who emailed you.
Many scammers use the names of legitimate companies to defraud job seekers. So, look up the email of the human resources department and/or recruiting department of the company that is purporting to contact you about the job, and ask them to verify that the person who contacted you is actually connected with the company. If the email address of the person contacting you doesn't include the name of the company, that should also alert you to conduct further checks.
An Internet search may alert you to complaints about the individual and/or the company concerned because it's likely that you aren't the first person that has been 'scammed'. There may be online forums that warn people about potentially fraudulent job advertisements.
U.S. job seekers should check whether any complaints were made to organizations such as the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). The FTC provides recommendations on its website regarding job scams, including, but not limited to: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0243-job-scams.
If you discover that an email received is connected to a fake or fraudulent Job Advertisement, you should send that email to email provider that hosts the scammer's email address and request that the account be closed. Some of the more common fraud departments are:
Yahoo: mail-abuse@cc.yahoo-inc.com
Google: abuse@googlemail.com
Hotmail: report_spam@hotmail.com
If you have already disclosed your bank details or received funds into your account you should contact your bank immediately to stop any transactions and ask their advice regarding next steps. You should also file a police report.
US job seekers should file a complaint with the FTC at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&panel1-1, their State Attorney General and their local Consumer Protection Agency. You can find more information by reviewing the video at:https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/media/video-0052-job-scams and https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/jobs-making-money.
Remember, if the job or the job offer sounds too good to be true, you need to be extra vigilant and conduct your own checks before responding to any communication or taking any action.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of red flags that should alert you to check whether a communication is legitimate and/or whether any particular Job Advertisement is fake or fraudulent ("Scam"). But, this list doesn't cover every scenario; it's merely intended to highlight some of the more common Scams. For more information, you should visit the websites listed above. Be on the alert:
If you're offered a job soon after submitting your resume/CV, without having to go through an interview or other usual hiring process. Usually, when you apply for a vacancy, you expect to wait a few days or weeks to hear back, and then go through a hiring and interview process. Scams will offer you the job almost immediately;
If the 'employer' claims that they found your resume/CV on a website and offers you the job immediately;
If the 'employer' sends you a check (to cover your initial salary or buy equipment for example) and asks you to deposit the check in your bank account and send them a check for some smaller amount. In addition to contacting College Recruiter, you should take the check and any records of the communication to your local Police Department and file a police report;
If the 'employer' requires you to spend money on training or materials;
If the 'employer' asks you for personal details and/or financial details that you didn't include in your resume/CV. The requested information may be your bank details or your birth date, passport number or copy of your passport, social security number, etc. This type of information isn't typically required until you've gone through a hiring process including a formal interview, possibly met the employer in person, and receive a formal offer letter or contract of employment;
If the email or other communication from the 'employer', contains misspellings, grammatical errors, is badly written or disjointed, and/or contains exclamation marks and words or sentences in capital letters, and/or requires you to accept the job offer immediately;
If you applied for a role that is less senior to the one that is offered to you or offers a salary that is more than you would expect for the role you applied to; or
If a Job Advertisement provides a lot of detail about a role but very little information about the type of candidate that is desired.
Additionally, although College Recruiter requests that companies maintain the confidentiality of the Job Applications and resumes/CVs they receive through the Services, College Recruiter cannot and does not guarantee that the information you provide will be held in confidence or properly secured by the applicable recipient.

B. Distribution of Advertisements and Access to the Resume Database
College Recruiter will make reasonable efforts to distribute Job Advertisements to third-party services, publishers, job boards and/or other entities in our distribution network, or in job alert emails (collectively, "Distribution Channels"). However, you acknowledge and accept that we have no control over the Distribution Channels or communication networks, and therefore we provide no guarantee that your Job Advertisements will actually be delivered over the Internet or via communication networks, be accepted by an entity in the Distribution Channels or be received and/or read by a Job Seeker. You accept that entities in the Distribution Channels have no obligation to use or display a Job Advertisement and may reject a Job Advertisement for any reason or no reason. You agree that College Recruiter is not liable to you or any third party if your Job Advertisement is rejected or not posted, and you will not be entitled to any refund for Job Advertisements not posted or distributed. By submitting a Job Advertisement, you give us permission to distribute that Job Advertisement in the Distribution Channels and on College Recruiter websites.
We make no guarantee as to the number or quality of candidates that you will receive as a result of your Job Advertisement. You are solely responsible for interviewing, performing background and reference checks on, verifying information provided by, and selecting an appropriate candidate. In certain cases, entities in the Distribution Channels may require that you agree to additional service policies in order to allow your Job Advertisement to be distributed on or via their services, and you hereby agree to such additional service policies as they apply to the distribution of your Job Advertisements.
C. Authorized Users

D. Removal of Advertisements
You acknowledge and agree that College Recruiter may, with no liability or penalty, remove any Job Advertisement or other content, communication or information posted, which in the sole judgment of College Recruiter, violates or may violate this Agreement, applicable laws, rules or regulations, or third party terms; or may adversely affect College Recruiter; or is false, inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, fraudulent, libelous, defamatory, immoral, offensive, obscene, pornographic, disruptive, threatening, abusive or illegal; or which may violate or lead to the violation of the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety and privacy of any third party.
E. Job Seekers

16. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
This Agreement contains an Arbitration provision, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit disputes you have against College Recruiter to binding and final arbitration. You will only be permitted to pursue claims against College Recruiter on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding, and you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.
If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 16 is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:
A. Binding Arbitration
This Section 16 is referred to in this Agreement as the "Agreement to Arbitrate". Unless you opt-out pursuant to the opt-out procedures set forth below, you agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and College Recruiter or its affiliates, whether relating to the Services, this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), or otherwise (each a "Dispute"), shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, each available at www.adr.org, or such other alternative dispute resolution body and arbitration rules that may be mutually agreed upon by you and College Recruiter. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by such rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and College Recruiter may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
B. Restrictions
You and College Recruiter agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between College Recruiter and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
C. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
You and College Recruiter agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or College Recruiter intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.
D. 30 Day Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 16 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to support@CollegeRecruiter.com or to the U.S. mailing address listed at the bottom of this Agreement. The notice must be sent to College Recruiter within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
17. GENERAL
A. Governing Law and Location
The Services are controlled and operated by College Recruiter from within the United States of America. College Recruiter makes no representations that the Services or the materials available via the Services, are appropriate or available for use in locations outside of the United States. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all United States of America laws as well as local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other jurisdiction, this Agreement and any Disputes shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. An arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same User to the extent required by applicable law. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all arbitration and other litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction of any dispute between you and College Recruiter related to this Agreement shall be located in Hennepin County, Minnesota.
You may not use the Services if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.
B. Assignment
This Agreement shall be personal to you and you may not assign, transfer, sublet, lease or delegate all or any of your rights and obligations, without the prior written consent of the General Counsel of College Recruiter or his/her designee. College Recruiter can assign this Agreement or delegate its obligations without restriction.
C. Relationship of the Parties
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, employer, contractor or employee of the other. Neither party shall have or hold itself out to any third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound.
Except as set out in this Agreement, only you and College Recruiter may enforce this Agreement as this contract is between you and College Recruiter; no other party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement.
D. Notification Procedures
College Recruiter may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our websites, as determined by College Recruiter in its sole discretion. College Recruiter reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. College Recruiter is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. We recommend that you whitelist all emails from the domain CollegeRecruiter.com in your email address book to help ensure you receive email notifications from us.
Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users of the Services receive the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
