Guest Images
Any guest images on this Website are protected by an access code and guest name printed on the sitting record given to the guest in the studio.  To access the images, you must create an account and enter the access code.
Creating an Account
By creating an account, you represent that you have the lawful right to enter this Website and have permission from the access code owner to view, share, create, print and/or order portraits, products and/or services from images photographed at JCPenney Portraits or under the JCPenney Portraits brand (together “Guest Images”).  An authorized user is licensed to use the Website for personal purposes only.  No commercial use is authorized or intended.  If you do not agree with any of these Terms, do not use the Website.
Access Code Security
You are responsible for keeping the access code and account password secure.  By sharing the access code or account password, others will have access to the Guest Images and may also have the ability to share the access code and Guest Images with others.  By sharing your entire portrait sitting/album, the access code will automatically be shared.  If you forward individual images, the access code will not be included.
Image Quality
The Guest Images on this Website are published in a low resolution format for uploading speed and viewing.  Any Guest Images that are printed or downloaded will not be as crisp as a high resolution print.  High resolution, professional quality prints are available for purchase through this Website.
Internet Communications
Information, including Guest Images on the Internet are electronic communications which can be forwarded, intercepted, printed and stored by others and could be randomly accessed by anyone.  Your sittings/albums are stored on a secure server and access is protected by access code and guest name.  By claiming your images and/or purchasing the Archival Service (where available), you authorize us to place and retain the Guest Images on the Internet, understanding the nature of the Internet and possibility of random access by hackers or others.
Permitted Use of Images
Professional portraits are copyright protected.  The images you view are low resolution, intended for electronic viewing and sharing only.  You may order our professional, high quality prints by selecting the “order” tab at the top of every page throughout the Website.  Guest Images may not be used for any commercial purpose without our prior written approval.  Use of a Guest Image on a business card, resume, Facebook, LinkedIn, or other personal social networking page is permissible and not considered a commercial use.  Using a Guest Image to create goods or services from the image for resale is a commercial use and prohibited.
No items may be included with or forwarded to any person or entity with unlawful intent or content.  Use must comply with the laws of the United States.
Length of Time Your Images are on the Website
Generally, images are available for 90 days from the date of sitting.  If you have purchased the Archival Service (limited to select studios at this time), images will be accessible on this Website for 24 months from the date of purchase of the Archival Service, or 90 days from the date of the sitting, if longer.  Orders for portraits or products must be made within that time.
Archival Service (Where Available)
The Archival Service is available in select studios.  The following additional Terms apply to Archival Service:
Adding Sittings/Albums to the Archival Service
If you have purchased the Archival Service and do not use the same JCPenney Portraits location and same guest name under which the Archival Service was purchased, you must claim your sittings/albums online within 90 days of the date of the sitting.  Otherwise, the sitting/album will not be archived.
Storage Limitation of Archival Service
The Archival Service allows storage of up to 25 sittings/albums.  An additional storage fee will be charged for each increment of 25 additional albums.
Termination of Access to Guest Images
You agree and acknowledge that we, in our sole discretion, may terminate your access to or use of the Guest Images and/or the Archival Service and remove and discard any content including, but not limited to, any and all information, communications, with respect to the Guest Images, at any time, without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to:
