LWTA PRIVACY POLICY
Our Privacy Policy has been updated and is now
available.  It will become effective 30 days from publication.  If
you have any questions, please reach out to us using the information provided
under the “Contacting Us” section below. Please note that specific provisions
of this Privacy Policy may be applicable only to residents of the State of
California.
Last Updated: December 19, 2019
AS America, Inc. d/b/a LIXIL Water Technology
Americas (“LWTA”), is a business unit of the LIXIL Group Corporation, and holds
a leading market position in a key region of the world.  Brands in its
portfolio include American Standard, GROHE and DXV, among others.  LWTA,
of course, recognizes that privacy is of key importance and we want you to be
familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your information.  This
Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of LWTA as well as its
subsidiaries in connection with information that we collect through various
channels including the websites we own and operate (collectively,
the “Websites”), through the software applications made available by us
for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “Apps”), through
our social media pages that we control (collectively, our “Social Media
Pages”), through email messages and through your communications with us
(collectively, including the Websites, the Apps and our Social Media Pages,
the “Online Services,” and together with offline and sales channels,
the “Services”).  Our Privacy Policy does not govern our collection
of information through any means other than through the Services and it does
not govern the collection of information by any third parties. This Privacy
Policy applies to Websites on which it is found posted.
By using our Websites or Services, or by
providing any information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this
Privacy Policy.
Collection of Information
“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to
an identifiable individual.  “Other Information” is any
information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly
relate to an individual.  Personal Information and Other Information is
herein collectively referred to as “Information”.
We may collect Information such as name,
address, telephone number and email address, date of birth, or goods and
services purchased, special requests made, and information about your
preferences and user account, either directly or through third parties.
We may also collect browser and device information, App usage data and
information collected through other technologies, as well as demographic and
aggregated information.
If you submit any Information relating to
other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services
(e.g., if you make a purchase or register for another individual), you
represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the
Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We and our service providers may collect
Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through Our Online Services: We may collect Information when you place an order or otherwise
purchase goods and services from us, communicate with us via online chat
services, inform us of any special requests or preferences you may have,
or sign up for a newsletter or participate in a survey, contest, or promotional
offer.
Through Our Offline Services: We may collect Information from you offline, such as when one of
our representatives visits your home, when you place an order over the
phone or contact customer service.
From Other Sources: We may receive your Information from other sources, such as public
databases, joint marketing partners, and other third parties. This may
include information from your credit card provider, and other partners,
and from social media platforms (including from people with whom you are
friends or otherwise connected to).  Certain Information from your
social media account may be linked to other Online Services and shared
with us, which may include Information that is part of your social media
account or your friends’ account.
From Authorized Licensees: LWTA may from time to time enter into a license or similar
agreement with a third party to sell products and services under a LWTA
brand.  Such an “Authorized Licensee” is independent from LWTA and
may provide information to us about your purchases or your intersection
with its sales or service departments.
Through your browser or device: Certain Information is collected by most browsers or
automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC)
address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution,
operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model,
language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of
the Online Services (such as the Apps) you are using. We use this
information for business purposes such as ensuring that the Online
Services function properly.
Through your use of the Apps: When you download and use an App, we and our service providers and
business partners may track and collect App usage data, such as the date
and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information
and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
Payment information: While payment information may be required if you elect to pay for
certain goods or services via credit card, we do not collect and do not
have access to complete credit card numbers.  This information is
passed through directly to our service provider, which processes
payment.  We do not take any responsibility for the acts or website
of the service provider regarding the processing of this
information.  We do retain “masked” or portions of credit card
numbers for limited purposes such as confirmation of credit card payment
receipts.
Using cookies: We collect information through the use of cookies which allows us
to, among other things, tailor our advertisements or offers to you. If you
do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a
simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline
cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to
your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.
If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some
inconveniences such as needing to log in every time you visit or you may
not receive offers from us that are relevant to your interests and
needs.  At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track”
signals.
Using pixel tags and other similar
technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web
beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Online
Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Online
Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our
marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Online
Services and response rates.
Google Analytics: We also use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which use
cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about
use of the Services and report on activities and trends. These services
may collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and
online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners,
and opt-out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on,
available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
You can learn more about Adobe and opt-out by visiting http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html.
Using Adobe Flash technology (including
Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies: We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other
things, collect and store information about your use of the Online
Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can
block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website
Storage Settings Panel. You can also control
Flash LSOs by going to the Global
Storage Settings Panel and following the
instructions.  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict
or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality
of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with the
Online Services. For more information, you may also wish to refer to https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.
IP Address: Your
IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that
you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address may
be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a
user accesses the Online Services, along with the time of the visit and
the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard
practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and
other services. We use IP addresses for several purposes, such as
calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the
Online Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP
address.
Physical Location & Mobile
Location-Based Services: We may collect the
general physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite,
cell phone tower, WiFi signals, or other technologies. We may use your
device’s general physical location to provide you with personalized
location-based services, advertising and content.  If you have
downloaded one of our Apps, you may enroll to receive special offers by
agreeing to the use of technologies that enable us to collect information
about your precise location through your mobile device’s Bluetooth or
similar capabilities. We will collect this precise location information
only if you opt-in through the App (either during your initial login or
later) to receive the special offers and by enabling these capabilities on
your mobile device.
By aggregating information: Aggregated Information does not personally identify you or any
other user of the Services (for example, we may aggregate Information to
calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area
code).
Use of Information
We may use and disclose Information for
various purposes, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable
law.  Such purposes include:
To provide the products or services you
request.
To complete your order and provide you with
related customer service.
To receive limited payment information from
the payment processor to validate credit card payment receipts against our
orders.
To send you administrative information,
marketing communications, promotional offers, periodic customer
satisfaction, market research or quality assurance surveys.
To personalize your experience and with
respect to the Online Services by presenting products and offers tailored
to you.
To allow you to participate in sweepstakes,
contests and other promotions and to administer these activities. Some of
these activities have additional rules and may be operated by service
providers who have their own rules, as well.  Please read any such
rules carefully as they could explain how your Information is used and
disclosed.
For our business purposes, such as data
analysis, audits, security and fraud monitoring and prevention, developing
new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying
usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns
and operating and expanding our business activities.
We may also use Information in connection with
loyalty programs and/or other expressly subscribed rewards based programs to:
Send you information regarding your account
status and activities;
Assess the benefits to which you are entitled;
Administer points earned;
Manage your choices regarding how you wish

programs) and track your points and transaction activity.

aware that Information may be transferred to or received by such affiliated
entities in the U.S. or in other countries, which may have different

that Authorized Licensee and not to this Privacy Policy.

each sweepstakes, contest or promotion in which you participate through
the Services, as they may contain additional information about the

you post or disclose through these services will become public and may be
available to other users and the general public.

responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third
parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which
