Terms & Conditions
Effective January 7, 2019
www.taurususa.com Web Site Terms of Use
IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE. THESE TERMS AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEB SITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS WEB SITE.
About This Agreement
This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) governs your use of this web site and its associated services (the “Site”). Taurus Holdings, Inc. through its subsidiary, Taurus International Manufacturing, Inc., (collectively, “Taurus,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) owns and operates this Site.
In addition, please review the Site’s Privacy Policy, which explains our information collection practices, such as the types of information we collect regarding visitors to the Site and how we may use that information.
Why you Cannot Order or Purchase Firearms from this Web Site
Federal law prohibits the interstate sale of firearms to persons or entities not possessing a valid Federal Firearms License (FFL). Taurus does not sell firearms to individuals or even to federally licensed individuals or retail dealers. Rather, we sell firearms directly to a small number of independent, federally licensed wholesale firearm distributors, who in turn sell firearms to federally licensed retail dealers, who in turn sell their firearms to legally authorized retail purchasers in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations.
Any reference to an independent licensed wholesaler or retailer on this Site does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of any such independent entity by us. They are not within our control, and we are not responsible in any manner for any of their policies or practices. If you have any questions concerning a firearms wholesaler or retailer, you should contact them directly, or contact your local law enforcement or regional Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office listed in your local telephone directory.
Copyrights and Trademarks
The Site consists of (1) copyrighted materials, such as information, articles, opinions, other text, directories, guides, graphics, photographs, illustrations, images, video and audio clips, music, advertising and promotional materials, data, software, compilations, designs, graphical interface, and overall “look and feel,”; (2) trademarks, logos, trade names, service marks, trade identities, and the domain names and URLs associated therewith, whether registered or unregistered (collectively the “Trademarks”); and (3) other forms of intellectual property (all of the foregoing collectively and individually are referred to as “Site Content”). All right, title, and interest in and to the Site Content is the property of Taurus or its licensors, and is protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, patent, or other proprietary rights and laws.
