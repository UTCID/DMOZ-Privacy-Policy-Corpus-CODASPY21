I’ve been using Sayler for about six months. I’ve been practicing law for 43 years and they’re the best attorney service I have ever used.
David Smyth, Esq.

Sayler Legal is a top notch attorney service and can handle anything that any law office would need, from court filings, process service, records requests, photocopying on site and remote, etc. You are the best!
Continued success to you, Stephanie, and your very efficient staff.
Warmest regards always,
Carol Bradley Lauderdale
Legal Assistant
I wanted to take a minute and email ya’ll and let you know how proud and honored to do business with your company. When I saw that you had returned one of our checks because we had already paid the invoice … you have no idea how that just touched me. Since we have had this company for 22 years and finding an honest and ethical company to work with is extremely rare. So with that being said THANK YOU!!!

I have been using Sayler Legal for a few years and they have always come through. From Process Serving to filing documents with the court, I know I can count on them to do a great job. They are timely and always keep me informed of the status of my requests. The staff is friendly and I appreciate their attention to detail.

Dear Colleagues:
God knows I complain when I get bad service, so I should probably do the opposite when I get exceptional service.
I have used Sayler Legal Service for a few things related to an active matter in Monterey Superior. I switched to them when another company just couldn’t seem to get things done in that courthouse.
The last thing they did for me, they really went above and beyond and they seem to know how things work at that courthouse.
If you got anything in Monterey Superior I do recommend these guys.

Stephanie, Misha and Sommer — I just want to let you know that our office appreciates your service so much! Everyone on Sayler’s staff is extremely efficient and professional. You make it so easy — and treat each filing or subpoena request that I send as if it is the most important and most urgent assignment you have ever received. Having Sayler just a quick email away is almost like having another legal assistant on our staff! I appreciate your speed, quality, and follow-through. Thank you!

Several days ago I contacted Sayler Legal Service to request copies of several documents filed in a civil case in Monterey and e-mail them to me in Las Vegas where I live. Through a stroke of very good luck, my inquiry was answered by Misha Conrad.
He was knowledgable, efficient, and clearly a credit to your organization. Within hours of my initial contact, he provided me with a credit card payment form and two days later I had my documents. He researched the reason why the Monterey clerk’s office initially could not locate the appropriate file, he sent me the Register of Actions that enabled me to request several additional documents that will be useful.
Misha’s professionalism is akin to a ray of sunshine cutting through a bureaucratic haze. We are so used to delays and errors (like the clerk’s office misplacing the file) that when someone comes along who does their job so well, it is worth taking the time to recognize them. My compliments to you and Sayler Legal Service.

I have relied upon Stephanie and her staff for over 15 years, and have been very pleased with the service her company has provided. The professionalism
demonstrated time and time again is what keeps the business relationship very strong. Being able to count on Stephanie each and every time ensures a lasting relationship well into the future.
