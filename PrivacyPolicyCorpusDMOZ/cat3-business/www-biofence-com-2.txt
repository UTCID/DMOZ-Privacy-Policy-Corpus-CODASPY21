Any information that We collect from Your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings You have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS privacy and data practices.
(a) Information Collected Via Technology
Information Collected by Our Servers. To make Our Site and Service more useful to You, Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from You, including Your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for Your visit.
Log Files. As is true of most websites, We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users" movements around the Site, gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole, and better tailor Our Site and Service to Our users" needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when You visit the Site or use Our Service again, it will recognize You and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to Your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.
Cookies. Like many online services, We use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to Your computer"s hard drive while You are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once You close Your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on Your computer until You delete them) to provide You with a more personal and interactive user experience. This type of information is collected to make Our Site and Service more useful to You and to tailor the experience with Us to meet Your special interests and needs.
Pixel Tags. In addition, We use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user"s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow Us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that We are sending only messages that are of interest to Our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a User. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Our users" Personal Data.
Flash LSOs. When We post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as "Flash Cookies," to store Your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by Your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.
Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and use Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to Our Site. We use the information We get from Google Analytics only to improve Our Site and Service. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to You on the date You visit the Site, rather than Your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with Your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on Your web browser to identify You as a unique user the next time You visit the Site and use Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google"s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about Your visits to the Site and use of Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

We may also use this information to show You and other users that You may know each other or have shared contacts. We rely upon You to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party"s names and e-mail addresses as required above.
