Polar Beverages encourages you to review the privacy statements of web sites you choose to link to from Polar Beverages so that you can understand how those web sites collect, use and share your information.

This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Polar Beverages to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
Polar Beverages web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Polar Beverages or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Polar Beverages; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Polar Beverages, or the public.
Use of Cookies
The Polar Beverages web site use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Polar Beverages pages, or register with Polar Beverages site or services, a cookie helps Polar Beverages to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Polar Beverages web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Polar Beverages features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Polar Beverages services or web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Polar Beverages secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Polar Beverages secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
Polar Beverages will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Polar Beverages encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Polar Beverages is protecting your information.
