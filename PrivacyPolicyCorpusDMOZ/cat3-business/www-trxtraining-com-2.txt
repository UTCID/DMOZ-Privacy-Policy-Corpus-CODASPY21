Additional Terms are either listed in these Terms, on the Site within the Application, within TRX Services or accompanied with a TRX Product, or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the additional TRX Offering. If these Terms of Use are inconsistent with Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control with respect to the TRX Offering for which it applies. For purposes of these Terms of Use, any references to TRX Services or TRX Products shall be deemed to include any TRX Offering included within or combined with the TRX Services or TRX Products.
c. Changes to these Terms and TRX Services. THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY TRX IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME.

When changes are made, TRX will make a new copy of the Terms available at the Site and within the Application and any new supplemental terms will be made available from within, or through, the affected TRX Services on the Site or within the Application. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms of Use.

Your authorizations in this section also apply to our payment processor and any other company who acts as a billing agent for us. You hereby authorize us to charge your specified payment method, in advance, for any purchases made through TRX Services or the TRX Site and/or to place a hold on your payment method with respect to any unpaid charges. You authorize the issuer of your selected payment method to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these Terms shall be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the payment provider to pay any amounts described herein, without requiring a signed receipt from you.

You acknowledge and agree that neither TRX, nor any TRX agent, will have any liability whatsoever for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred by you as a result of attempts to charge, and/or place holds on, your specified payment method as contemplated by these Terms. If you provide a debit card number instead of a credit card number, you authorize all charges described herein to be applied to such debit card unless and until you provide a credit card number.
e. Third-Party Payment Processor. You agree to pay us, through our payment processor or financing partner (as applicable), all charges at the prices then in effect for any purchase in accordance with the applicable payment terms presented to you at the time of purchase.

b. Termination for Breach. TRX may, in TRX’s sole discretion, suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) for TRX Services or block or remove any User Content (defined below) that you submitted if TRX determines that you have violated these Terms or that your conduct or User Content would tend to damage TRX’s reputation and goodwill.
