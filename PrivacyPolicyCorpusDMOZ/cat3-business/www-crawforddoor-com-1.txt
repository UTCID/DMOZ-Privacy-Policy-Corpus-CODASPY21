Overhead sectional doors
Attractive and easy to operate, glazed or panel, steel or aluminum, overhead sectional doors are a durable, tight-sealing fit for industrial use. Sliding up and under the ceiling, they maximize space around the door opening.
Loading dock equipment
Loading dock equipment is key in the efficient and safe handling of goods. Levelers, shelters, loadhouses and other accessories make loading and unloading more convenient and sustainable.
Vertical-lifting fabric doors
A unique vertically stacking design for large door openings and tough environments. Despite their size, they handle both high wind loads and other weather extremes.
High speed doors
High speed doors provide smooth traffic flow, access control and separation of climate zones in both interior and exterior high-traffic applications. High speeds, tight seals and intuitive safety features help improve efficiency in any facility.
Folding doors
Folding doors are ideal where space is limited around the opening, minimizing the ceiling space required inside the building. Few moving parts contributes to high reliability.

As your dedicated partner for any entrance solution, we support you all the way – from design and installation to modernization and service – ensuring a seamless flow of people, goods and vehicles through your doors.

Our heritage
Crawford started out manufacturing garage doors in the 1950's and has since then expanded into the industrial sector. In 1966 the first industrial overhead sectional door was delivered in Sweden and after that Crawford began specializing in loading dock equipment, folding doors and high-speed doors.
In 2011 Cardo, the parent company of both Crawford and Megadoor was acquired by ASSA ABLOY Group. Determined to set new standards in customer experience, ASSA ABLOY Entrance Systems gather all products and services under one brand. For you this means we have gathered the expertise and experience and still offer superior industrial doors and loading dock equipment as well as Megadoor vertical-lifting fabric doors. To complement your industrial doors, we also offer a broad range of automatic pedestrian- and high-performance doors as well as service.
