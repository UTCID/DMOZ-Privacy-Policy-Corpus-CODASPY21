Our response to COVID-19 outbreak
March 30, 2020
Dear IVolatility subscriber, we would like to give you an update on IVolatility's response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
We implemented measures to safeguard our team and fully transitioned our workforce to work from home status as of two weeks ago.
We can assure you that we will continue to operate our tools and services providing you and users around the world with crucial market volatility updates. Due to abnormal activity in the market, there is a strong technical overload on all data transmission channels, and we constantly monitor data services and adjust and split the data stream to process data without delays or interruptions. Further, our support and sales team are available as usual, and we are looking forward to hearing how we can help you!
We want you to feel informed and confident when working with us. We have several initiatives we're deploying to help our clients in this complicated time, including free subscriptions to our live market tracker, discounts on data, and more that will be announced very soon. We understand these are volatile times, but together we'll get through it stronger than before.
Take care of yourself and your family, safeguard your safety and wellbeing, and remember to wash your hands frequently.
We appreciate your loyalty, and we look forward to serving you with the most accurate, consistent, and up-to-date volatility data available, since for options, we are Big Data!
Thanks,
IVolatility team

Welcome to IVolatility.com Knowledge Base - your only starting point
for Options Analysis and Trading Education!
For
those who are relatively new to the Options trading world we recommend
excellent materials provided by The Options Industry Council (OIC), a non-profit
association created to educate the investing public and brokers about
the benefits and risks of exchange-traded options. They can be
contacted directly on 1-888-678-4667. The OIC educational materials not
only cover basic topics (such as what option contract is) but also give
an introduction to some Advanced Concepts (such as what Implied
Volatility and Greeks are). The site also covers most known options
Strategies - must to read material.
To get yourself
started with Volatility concept we advise you to read the articles:
Putting
volatility to work written by Ravi Kant Jain and published in the
Active Trader Magazine (April 2001),
Exploring
the Edge written by Jack Walker in 2010.
Our Understanding IVolatility.com
Data section provides an in-depth description of Implied and
Historical (Stock) Volatilities as well as our 'Implied Volatility
Index' - a unique characteristic which represents a composite
Volatility for a stock by taking suitable weighted individual option
volatilities. We also provide pretty detailed and simultaneously
easy-to-understand description of the most significant values
sophisticated traders can't live without - such as volatility surface,
volatility skew, correlation and lots of other indicators including
unique ones available only to IVolatility.com subscribers. Get yourself
familiar with these to be able to use our services effectively and
successfully!
The IVolatility Jargon section explains some
terms widely used throughout the site. The FAQ sections also worth looking at - you might find
some of your questions answered here.
Though we
tried to make our services quite intuitive and easy to use, sometimes
you need a bit of advice using it. Every service on the site has a
quick intro page - please refer to the IVolatility services list to find a 'Detailed
information' link with service screenshots and description of the
service usage. For our most powerful and sophisticated services we also
provide detailed service guides available for download (Adobe Reader
required).
Sometimes the easiest way to find answer
to your question is to make use of the Site Search feature. We indexed all educational
content available on our site so you could quickly look up word or a
phrase.
If you have any questions or ideas you
would like to share with Ivolatiity.com members club - welcome to our Forum (broken into Methodology and IVolatility Services
sections).
Our newest addition is IVolatility RT
Spread Scanner blog with Bud Huslett. The Blog author is Bud Haslett -
veteran options trader with over 23 years of options experience
including 20 years as a market maker on the trading floor and three
years as an institutional options money manager.
