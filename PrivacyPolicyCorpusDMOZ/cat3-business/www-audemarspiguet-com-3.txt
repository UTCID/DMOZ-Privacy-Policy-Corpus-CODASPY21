Cookie Policy
WHAT IS A COOKIE?
A Cookie is a small text file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer or other electronic device (“Device”) used to access our website(s), mobile application(s) and any other online media or electronic communication service that we operate (“Services”). Your web browser stores information on your Device regarding your visit to and use of our Services for record-keeping purposes (e.g. logging in) or track information.
We use Cookies to improve your user experience, monitor statistics and optimise advertising campaigns when you use our Services. You can choose whether to accept or decline Cookies by changing the settings under Manage my Cookie Settings below or directly on your web browser. We do not use Cookies to collect personal information such as your name; however, Cookies might help us relate information to the personal information you provided us through other means (e.g. general website registration).
We also use Pixels to operate, analyse, and optimise our advertising campaign on third parties’ platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn).
A Pixel is a small graphic file placed in the webpage code of our Services. It collects data from a user’s behaviour and reports the action to a server to measure the performance of our advertising. However, they are not stored on your web browser. Pixels can be used by third parties to improve the functionalities of their services and generate their own Cookies based on your interests and use of our Services. By using Pixels, third parties determine our website visitors’ specific target group to provide Audemars Piguet targeted advertising on their own platform. It also helps third parties to analyse the effectiveness of their adverts, done for Audemars Piguet, while enabling us to see whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on an advert.
WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?
When you access our Services, the types of Cookies listed below may be placed on your Device. They are categorised by source, technical features and purposes. These categories are not mutually exclusive; a Cookie may belong to several of the following categories.

First-party Cookies are placed on your Device directly by us and can only be read by our Services. They can be “session” or “persistent” Cookies (see below). For example, we use first-party Cookies to speed up the log-in process or enhance your user experience.
- COOKIES FROM EXTERNAL SOURCE (THIRD-PARTY COOKIES)
Third-party Cookies are placed on your Device by some of our third-party partners. For example, they are used in relation to audience measurement analysis and to improve the relevance of our Services’ content.
- SESSION COOKIES
Session Cookies are temporarily stored on your Device while you are using our Services. They become invalid once the browser session is closed. We and our partners use session Cookies to manage and measure your access and use of our Services during a single browser session and ensure the best performance of our Services.
- PERSISTENT COOKIES
Persistent Cookies are placed on your Device during a browser session and remain stored on your Device for a defined period of time after you leave our Services.
