Terms of Use & Privacy Policy
At Royal Appliance Mfg. Co. d/b/a TTI Floor Care North America (“Oreck”), we respect the privacy of your information. We provide this explanation about our online information practices as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy.
The Information We Collect
At the time you make a purchase request on Oreck.com, we collect and store your name, address, credit card numbers and other personally-identifying information. We need this information to provide and to authorize our retail partners and service providers to provide goods and services that you request and to let you know of additional goods and services in which you might be interested. We also use this information to customize your experience using our Website.
We may ask you for personally identifying information at other times, such as if you enter into a promotion, communicate with us, or complete a survey. If you opt-in to receive information regarding a promotion, you give us your permission to share your name and e-mail address with the third parties involved in offering and administering the promotion.
In addition, we automatically gather general non-personal, statistical information about our Website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We use this data in the aggregate, for example, to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally-identifying information without your permission. We may also match user information we collect with offline data available from other sources in order to carry out our services and conduct target advertising and promotions more effectively.

Cookies, Log Files, and Other Information Collection
Oreck.com uses cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on other websites. We also use cookies as a service to our users by saving the contents of your shopping cart. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s hard drive. Many online services and mobile applications use cookies, as well as other technologies, including but not limited to web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers in order to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. Oreck may also utilize these technologies to collect information when you use the services offered through our partners. Cookies and other similar technology can only record about you what you have already chosen to tell us and cannot retrieve or transmit information you do not authorize. Please be aware that cookies are required to add items to your shopping cart and then proceed through the checkout process. You are usually able to disable cookies through your internet browser options; however, by doing so you will limit the functionality we can provide to you during your visit at Oreck.com.
In addition, we use IP addresses to analyze trends and combine information collected by our affiliates or other third parties with information collected on Oreck.com. We may also let other companies use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, and other similar technologies on Oreck.com. These companies may collect information regarding your use of Oreck.com and other websites, as well as other online services in order to, for example, analyze trends, track data, understand your online activity, ascertain content popularity, and deliver targeted advertisements for Oreck and other companies.
Third Party Practices
Oreck.com may contain links to third party sites or host other advertising or promotional services. The privacy policy of an advertiser, promotional service, or other third party appearing at our site may differ from ours, and Oreck is not responsible for any third party privacy practices and has no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations treat your personal information. These terms of use and privacy policy apply only to information collected by Oreck.
The Way We Use Information
We do not sell or rent personally-identifying information collected during your use of our Website without your permission.
We use non-personally-identifying information we collect at our site to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site’s content, layout, and services.
We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests, which we may use to customize our service for you.
We use your e-mail address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of the site. We will not send you promotions or announcements unless you give us permission to do so. You can opt out of receiving such contact by either clicking the “unsubscribe” link in one of our emails or contacting our customer service department at our Contact Us page.
If you place a request for products or services, we use your personal information to ship your order; if the products or services are from a retail partner, we may provide your relevant information to that retailer for purposes of the transaction. If you establish a credit account with us or our providers, we collect additional information, including billing information, credit card number and expiration date, tracking information from checks or money orders, and other relevant information.
We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and/or improve our products and services.
During the normal course of doing business, we will continue to share your information among our business units, our affiliates and unaffiliated third parties as necessary. If you obtain goods or services provided by one of our retail partners or service providers, we may exchange with the vendor personally-identified information about you for purposes of your transaction.
At times, we need to share the e-mail addresses of those who have unsubscribed from our email list with our partners (list brokers, affiliates and broadcast email vendors) for the purpose of making sure that they too remove those email addresses from their lists. At times, we do share physical mailing addresses with reputable, trusted catalog vendors who offer quality products we think might be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share your physical mailing address with other companies, please let us know by contacting us at our Contact Us page, and include your name and physical mailing address.
Security
We employ reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. When you place an order at Oreck.com, our secure sockets layer (SSL) encrypts all the information you input before it is sent to us, including your name, address, phone number and credit card number. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
