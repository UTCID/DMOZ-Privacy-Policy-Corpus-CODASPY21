Privacy
IIAT’s Privacy Policy is available at https://www.iiat.org/about-us/privacy-policy
PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
Notice of alleged copyright infringement by any Materials on the IIAT website must be made in writing to IIAT, by directing a Notice of Alleged Infringement (“Notice”) to:
WEBMASTER
Independent Insurance Agents of Texas (IIAT)
at one of the following addresses:
For U.S. mail: P.O. Box 684487, Austin, TX 78768;
For courier delivery: 1115 San Jacinto Boulevard, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78701;
For electronic mail: webmaster@iiat.org
The Notice to IIAT must include:
(i) a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
(ii) specific identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single Notice, a complete, itemized identification of such works. This may require the provision of a copy of the work(s) alleged to have been infringed, if not voluminous, or if voluminous, excerpts from the work(s) sufficient to identify the work(s) without ambiguity;
(iii) identification of the specific material on the IIAT website that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, and that is requested to be removed or access to which is requested to be disabled, together with information sufficient to permit IIAT to locate the material on the IIAT website easily;
(iv) contact information sufficient to permit IIAT to contact the complaining party, including a full name, address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address, at which the complaining party may be contacted; and
(v) a sworn and notarized statement that (a) the complaining party has a objective good faith belief that use of the allegedly infringing material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law; (b) the information provided in the Notice by the complaining party is accurate; (c) the User-contributor who has posted the materials alleged to be infringing is not authorized to have used such copyrighted work in whole or part in the manner complained of; and (d) the complaining party is the owner of the copyright that is allegedly being infringed (or is authorized by the copyright owner to act on that owner’s behalf, together with a copy of a written, notarized authorization to that effect from that owner).
If a Notice of Alleged Infringement does not comply with these requirements, IIAT may attempt to contact the person making the Notice and obtain additional information that complies with these requirements, but IIAT is not obligated to do so. IIAT may, at its discretion, not act on the basis of a Notice that is incomplete or that, on its face, is internally inconsistent or contradictory, or that appears to be legally flawed or patently implausible.
Once a proper written Notice is received by IIAT, and if it appears to state an objectively supportable legal claim on its face, IIAT will:
(A) remove or block access to the allegedly infringing material; and
(B) notify the User-contributor supplying the allegedly infringing material of IIAT’s action.
If the User-contributor supplying the allegedly infringing material provides IIAT a timely written counter-notification with the elements described below, IIAT will:
(1) send a copy of the counter-notification to the person making the claim of infringement; and
(2) inform the person making the claim of infringement that IIAT may unblock or permit the reposting of the blocked or removed material in ten (10) business days, unless the person making the claim of infringement notifies IIAT in writing that he/she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the IIAT User-contributor from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity relating to the material in question, and provides a file-stamped copy of the complaint initiating such a lawsuit.
Counter-Notification
Counter-notification must be in writing to IIAT’s designated agent, who will be identified by IIAT in the IIAT notice to the User-contributor supplying the allegedly infringing material, and must include:
(w) the physical or electronic signature of the User-contributor of the material alleged to have infringed the complaining party’s copyrights;
(x) specific identification of the material that has been blocked or removed and the specific location in the IIAT website at which it appeared before it was removed or blocked;
(y) a sworn and notarized statement either that the User-contributor has an objective good faith belief that the challenged material was removed or blocked as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material removed or blocked, or that the User-contributor has a clear legal right to use the challenged materials in the manner complained of, together with documentary support for that assertion; and
(z) the User-contributor’s name, address, and telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address, together with a statement that the User-contributor consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which the User-contributor’s address is located (or if the User-contributor’s address is outside the United States, for the judicial district in which Independent Insurance Agents of Texas (IIAT) is located), and that the User-contributor will accept service of process from the person who made the claim of infringement or an agent of such person.
Disclaimer of warranty; limitation of liability
THE USER OF THE IIAT SITE ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR THE USE OF THE SITE, THE MATERIALS AND THE INTERNET GENERALLY. IIAT AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR ENDORSEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARD TO THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR USE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
IIAT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR ANY WARRANTY ABOUT, AND DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LEGAL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR, THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY MATERIAL ON THE IIAT SITE. IIAT WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, DIRECT, ACTUAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, OR LOST OR FORGONE PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE MATERIALS ON THE IIAT SITE. IF THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR THE EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY IS HELD INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN IIAT'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL TYPES OF DAMAGES CUMULATIVELY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $100.
THE MATERIALS ON THE IIAT SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. NO INFORMATION GIVEN BY INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS OF TEXAS (IIAT), ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or the disclaimer or limitation of duration of an implied warranty, so the limitation or exclusion stated herein may not apply to all Users. This disclaimer of warranty will not apply to the extent that any provision of this disclaimer of warranty is prohibited by any federal, state, or local law that cannot be preempted or waived by contract or other consent. If the User’s state law does not permit such disclaimers of implied warranties, that User may have specific legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
No endorsements
Reference on the IIAT website or in any Materials to any products, services, or processes, or hypertext or other links to third parties or other information, by trade name, trademark, service mark, or to any manufacturer, supplier or otherwise does not imply endorsement, sponsorship, approval or recommendation by IIAT.
Modification of Terms and Conditions of Use from time to time
IIAT reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions of Use at any time, in its sole discretion; the User agrees to abide by these Terms and Conditions of Use as they may be posted on this website from time to time, including any modifications by IIAT, whether or not separate notice of such modifications has been provided to the User; and the User agrees and acknowledges that it is the User’s responsibility to check this website periodically to determine if these Terms and Conditions of Use have been modified.
Governing law; venue; severability
This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, with the exception of its choice of laws provisions, so that Texas substantive contract and other law shall apply to the interpretation, application and enforcement of this Agreement. Venue for any claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement will be exclusively in the state courts of Travis County, Texas, or the federal district courts of the Western District of Texas, Austin Division. If any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect.
