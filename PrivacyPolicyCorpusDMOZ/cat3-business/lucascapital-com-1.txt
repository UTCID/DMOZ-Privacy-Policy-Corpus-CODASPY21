Terms of Use

Please read the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Use”) before using the Lucas Capital Management, L.L.C. (the “Firm”) website (the “Website”). Your access to and use of the Website is subject to these Terms of Use and all applicable laws and regulations. The Terms of Use constitute a legal agreement between you and the Firm. The Website is available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Website is not available to persons under age 18. By accessing and using the Website, you accept, without qualification, these Terms of Use. If you do not approve and accept these Terms of Use without qualification, you should exit the Website immediately.
PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE LIMITATION
The Website is for your personal and non-commercial use. The Firm grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited personal license to access and use the Website, conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms of Use. You may not modify, copy (except as set forth below), distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, products or services obtained from the Website. You may not link other websites to the Website without the Firm’s prior written permission. You may print one hard copy of the information and download one temporary copy of the information into one single computer’s memory solely for your own personal, non-commercial use and not for distribution, provided that all relevant copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices are kept intact. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of the Website. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact the Firm immediately for a new password. If you provide your password to any third party, you will be solely responsible for any actions taken by such a third party using your password. All information on the non-public (i.e., password-restricted) areas of the Website is confidential and private and you may not disclose or distribute such information to any other person for any purpose and is made available solely for your personal use in connection with your investment activities. You are prohibited from using the Website to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation. You also are prohibited from using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Website for any purpose without the prior written permission of the Firm. You may not take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Website or any activities conducted on the Website, or bypass any measures that we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Website. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR INVESTMENT ADVICE
The funds that the Firm advises are not offered through the Website. An offer regarding any such fund may be made only after you have received a Confidential Offering Circular or Private Offering Memorandum concerning that fund and have had the opportunity to discuss all matters concerning any prospective investment that you desire. The Website does not provide all information material to an investor’s decision to invest in any such fund, including, but not limited to, risk factors. For more information, please refer to a fund’s Confidential Offering Circular or Private Offering Memorandum and read it carefully before you invest.
The information on the Website is intended to enable investors to understand the nature of the Firm’s financial advisory services. It is not intended as and does not constitute investment advice or legal or tax advice or an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any securities. The information in the Website should not be construed as the Firm’s endorsement, recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or retrieving any information found on the Website, and the Firm urges you to make sure that you understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Website. You should evaluate the information made available through the Website, and you should seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other information.
The Firm’s services are designed to integrate with the services provided by its clients’ other financial, legal and tax advisers, not to replace their services. The Firm advises its clients from time to time on non-investment related matters, but clients must rely on their other professional advisers for final approval and/or implementation of non-investment matters.
You acknowledge that any of your requests for information are unsolicited and any information shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice from the Firm to you or to form an investment advisory relationship, or any other client relationship between you and the Firm or any of its affiliates or employees. The Firm strongly recommends that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. The Firm does not guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. The Firm may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Website.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT COMPARABLE
The performance data presented on the Website reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and net figures reflect the deduction of expenses, management fees, and incentive fees and allocations.
Past performance does not indicate future returns. The performance results have not been compiled, reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. Results for the current year are based on the internal books and records of each fund and are subject to adjustment when that fund’s financial statements for the current year are audited.
The Firm believes that comparing each fund’s performance to any single market index or other benchmark is or may be inappropriate. These indices and benchmarks are provided for comparative purposes, but only as examples of general market performance. Unlike these indices and benchmarks, each fund’s portfolio may contain options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls) and other derivative securities, futures and other commodity interests and currencies, and may include short sales of securities, margin trading, securities of smaller capitalization companies and types of securities that are different than those reflected in these indices and benchmarks, and is not as diversified as these indices and benchmarks. Due to the differences between the composition of a fund’s portfolio and these indices and benchmarks, the Firm cautions potential investors that no such index or other benchmark is directly comparable to any fund.
TRUTHFUL INFORMATION
As a condition to your use of the Website, you represent and warrant to, and agree with, the Firm that, all of the information that you provide shall be truthful, accurate and complete.
