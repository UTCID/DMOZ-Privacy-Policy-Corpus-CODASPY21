Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 – Section 54 - requires organizations that operate in the United Kingdom having an annual revenue of £36m or above to produce a Slavery and Human Trafficking statement each year.
Greenwich Associates has a commitment towards the global eradication of human trafficking, taking specific measures to ensure no breaches of the modern slavery laws are occurring with our active suppliers.
Any potential breaches that are brought to our attention or otherwise identified within our supply chain will be reviewed with the supplier. Greenwich Associates will revisit our relationship with the supplier(s) deemed to be out of compliance with the regulations or acting in violation of the law and determine if we are able to assist them to gain compliance or whether we should continue to conduct business.
We conduct business in an industry generally recognized as low risk in relation to potential breaches in the Modern Slavery Act. Each supplier is reviewed for the likeliness of the risk associated with these laws and an assessment is made where necessary.
Firm Organization
Greenwich Associates LLC, is a privately held partnership registered in the state of Delaware. The company is managed by a subset of partners (“Managing Group”) who are responsible for ensuring that all policies are published and understood by employees within the organization and that our supplier contracts include requirements to ensure adherence to all applicable global laws and regulations including the Modern Slavery Act of 2015.
A Human Resources Department exists with the responsibility to know and understand the legal employment requirements for each location we operate in.
Employee Statement
Employees are paid no less than the applicable local minimum wage for the location they are assigned. Employees are made aware of the firms obligations through appropriate handbooks, policies and signage as required by local law.
Annual Business Conduct training includes the requirement to follow all laws and regulations including the Modern Slavery Act.
Human Resources ensures that all employees are legally able to work for the Firm and their employment meets local laws. We do not employ staff under the legal age of employment.
The standard business hours of the firm are published in the Employee Handbook provided to each new hire and published on our Intranet. Any additional hours required to complete work functions are an allowable exception managed through our management team.
