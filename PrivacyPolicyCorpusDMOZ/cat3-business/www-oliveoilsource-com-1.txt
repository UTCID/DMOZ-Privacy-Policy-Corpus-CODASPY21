THE OLIVE OIL SOURCE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE
1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
The Olive Oil Source, The Olive Oil Source Wholesale Store, and the Olive Oil Source Boutique provide a collection of online resources, including classified ads, forums, and various products and services, (referred to hereafter as "the Service") subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Use ("TCU"). By using the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TCU. In addition, when using particular services of The Olive Oil Source, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all services of The Olive Oil Source, which may change from time to time.
Should you object to any term or condition of the TCU, any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with The Olive Oil Source in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of The Olive Oil Source.
The Olive Oil Source has the right, but is not obligated, to strictly enforce the TCU through self-help, community moderation, active investigation, litigation and prosecution.
2. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time.
Such modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. You must review this agreement on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes.
3. CONTENT
You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, or other materials ("Content") posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item ("Item") of Content that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that The Olive Oil Source does not control, and is not responsible for Content made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Furthermore, The Olive Oil Source site and Content available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of The Olive Oil Source.
The Olive Oil Source makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or authenticity of the information contained in any such site.
Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk.
You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will The Olive Oil Source be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that The Olive Oil Source does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that The Olive Oil Source shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete, or move any Content that is available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the TCU or for any other reason.
You agree that The Olive Oil Source shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that The Olive Oil Source is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release The Olive Oil Source, its officers, employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and / or our service. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
