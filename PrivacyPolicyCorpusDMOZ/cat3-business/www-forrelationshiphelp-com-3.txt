You got here because something isn't feeling right with your relationship. Let's figure a few things out.
A Healthy Relationship often feels like this:
“I feel relaxed most of the time, knowing that my partner has my back”“I know that I can say what’s on my mind, or express my feelings, and I won’t be belittled or laughed at, or questioned about the validity of my feelings.”“Most of the time I am very confident that my partner has my best interests at heart.”“I have no fear about my children being treated well, or about what they are seeing or hearing from my ex.”“Drama is very rare in our household.”“I know where I stand, and I feel connected to my partner.”“We are able to discuss very difficult or emotional things, and there is always mutual respect and compassion.”“My partner/ex listens to me and we make solid agreements.” Having a healthy, emotionally mature and intimate relationship is a thing to celebrate! If you’re almost there, or have been there but something’s missing lately, let’s get to the bottom of it now!
The 3 Must-Haves of Healthy Adult Relationships
A Toxic Relationship often feels like this:
“I can’t put my finger on what’s wrong anymore and feel like I am going crazy.”“I feel like I have to live on high alert. I don’t know what’s coming next.”“Nothing I do is right or good enough.““It’s always my fault…even when it isn’t.”“I am confused all the time, things are unpredictably awesome or horrible, and nowhere in between.”“I’m tired of the silent treatment.”“Sometimes I think my partner really hates me.”“I’m concerned for my children, what they’re seeing and hearing.”“I’m so tired of the drama, the outbursts, the attacks, and the cycles.”“Should I stay or should I go?”“Can this relationship ever get better?”  I know it’s very debilitating to feel like you never do it “right”, or well enough. These feelings come from emotional abuse.If you’re feeling these on a regular basis, it IS time to find out what’s really going on.
