Last updated August 27, 2018
For more information or if you have any questions about these terms of use, please contact us at help@globalmed.com.
Acceptance of Terms of Use
These Terms of Use (“Agreement”) between you and GlobalMedia Group, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, doing business as GlobalMed (“GlobalMed”), set forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of software applications, related mobile applications, and sites owned and operated by GlobalMed (collectively, the “Site”).  By using the Site in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site or any third-party services offered on or through the Site (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to be bound by this Agreement.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THIS SITE.
YOU MAY NOT USE THE SITE IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18.  THE USE OR ACCESS OF THE SITE BY ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 IS UNAUTHORIZED, UNLICENSED AND IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
We may modify this Agreement, or any policy or guideline of the Site, at any time at our sole discretion.  Any modifications will be posted on this page and will be effective immediately, so we suggest you review this page on a regular basis.  Your continued use of the Site after any modification will mean you agree to this Agreement as modified. If you do not agree to any amended terms, do not use the Site.
GlobalMed offers the Site through which Providers, patients and authorized third parties may connect for purposes of delivering, receiving, supporting and/or verifying telemedicine services.  GlobalMed operates, supports and maintains the Site.  GlobalMed is not a Provider and is not directly involved in transactions, nor a party to any contracts, between a Provider and a patient, a Provider and a third party, or a patient and a third party. Moreover, GlobalMed does not: (a) provide medical assessment, advice, diagnosis, and/or treatment; (b) control the quality, accuracy, scope or legality of any assessments, advice, diagnosis, treatments, information, or recommendations made by a Provider; (c) control any aspect of a Provider’s decision or the decisions of any third party such as an insurance company’s decision on whether or not a claim or service is covered by such insurance company or the patient’s policy; or (d) verify the accuracy, validity, legality, or appropriateness of any assessments, advice, diagnosis, treatments, information, and recommendations made by Providers.  GlobalMed shall not be liable to you or any other person for any of the Services you obtain from a Provider or any third party.
Telemedicine
THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE SITE ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL CARE YOU MAY NEED.  YOU USE THIS SITE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP.
Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare services such as medical assessments, diagnosis, advice and treatment via a virtual platform such as the Site where the patient and the healthcare provider are not in the same physical location. GlobalMed, through the Site, offers an online platform by which users can engage an independently licensed healthcare professional to obtain healthcare services such as medical diagnosis, medical advice and medical treatment of certain conditions.

The Site is available to individuals who are at least 18 years old and to minors (under 18 years of age) but only if the use of the Site is supervised by at least one parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years old.

The failure of an electronic connection, server, computer, or other systems or technology could interfere and/or delay the communication between you and a Provider and the ability of the Provider to diagnose and evaluate the problem and provide medical advice.
The failure of privacy and security protocols as technology continues to evolve and individuals attempt to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our Site.
