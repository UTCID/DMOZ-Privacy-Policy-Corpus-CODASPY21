Information Collection
We do not collect any personally identifiable information on our website unless you submit the information or give your consent. We use website monitoring software to gather aggregate information about our visitors’ browsing activities in order to improve our website and better serve our members/consumers. We use this data to analyze trends, track visitor movement, and gather demographic information. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We provide calculators and other online tools to assist visitors in making financial decisions. These tools do not collect or store any information entered by web visitors. Applications for services, accounts, or loans you submit through Online Banking, Open an Account, and/or Apply for a Loan and forms that you complete and submit on our website are protected in accord with this Privacy Policy.
We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under age 13 on our website.
When you log in to Online Banking, Open an Account, and/or Apply for a Loan, your identity is no longer anonymous; each username corresponds to a specific member/consumer and that information is collected and retained. To ensure the security of your accounts and information, all actions are monitored and tracked. You should never share your username and/or password with another person to ensure the security and privacy of your accounts and information. Refer to the Online Banking, Open an Account, and/or Apply for a Loan disclosures for complete privacy, security, and usage information.

We understand the confidential and secure nature of your personal and financial data and have multiple security measures in place. Applications for services, account(s) or loan(s) that you submit through Online Banking, Open an Account, or Apply for a Loan and forms that you complete and submit on our website are submitted through secure, encrypted web pages. You can verify the security of a web page by looking for the “locked padlock” icon which most browsers display as a sign of a secure web page. To ensure the encryption of your web visit, you should ensure that you are using the most current web browser available. When you have logged in to Online Banking, Open an Account, or Apply for a Loan, all transactions and information are secure. We utilize the latest in technology to monitor Online Banking, Open an Account, and Apply for a Loan activity to protect your transactions and information.

Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer’s free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Calling us at 1-888-556-7376.
Visiting https://www.cefcu.com/forms/contact/ccpa
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf by granting the authorized agent written permission to do so (in which case we may require you to verify your identity directly to us) or by providing the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request to exercise access, data portability, or deletion rights must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:
Account Number (if current member)
ID Number (if current member)
Name
Address
Date of Birth
Phone Number
Place of Employment
A signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request if we are unable to successfully verify your identity
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We will confirm receipt of a verifiable consumer request within 10 days of our receipt of the verifiable consumer request and provide information about our verification process and when you should expect a response, except in instances where we have already granted or denied the request. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period (which can be up to 90 days from receipt) in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
For exercising any of your rights under the CCPA, we will not discriminate against you by:
Denying you goods or services.
Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
We do not currently provide financial incentives for the collection, sale, or deletion of personal information.  However, the CCPA allows us to offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that could result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we might offer in the future would reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program that we might offer in the future requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
