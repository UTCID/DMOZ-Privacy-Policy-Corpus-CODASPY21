Skip to content(888) 252-5561 | research@hiresafe.comClient LoginNewsletterEmployment Background Check BlogThe California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA,
is an unprecedented privacy law that went into effect January 1, 2020. CCPA is
expected to be the strictest data privacy law in the U.S. and will accomplish
three major objectives, giving California residents the right to:Know what information
businesses are collecting about themTell a business not to
share or sell their personal informationProtections against
businesses that do not uphold the value of their privacy.CCPA compliance is a fast-approaching reality for organizations across the USA and the world. If they receive personal data from California residents, then they must implement a number of new procedures including:Right to Access: Organizations subject to the CCPA must honor consumers’ requests regarding the right to access their personal information. The disclosure process of the information requested must be free of charge for a consumer and sent by physical mail or electronically.Right to Delete: Organizations subject to the CCPA have an obligation to honor consumers’ requests regarding the right to delete their personal information.HireSafe, and all FCRA-compliant Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRA’s), are specifically EXEMPT from this legislation. There is no need for action with the data requested and processed by HireSafe on your behalf in the course of our background screening process for your applicants.Posted in California Regulations, Compliance, Uncategorized
