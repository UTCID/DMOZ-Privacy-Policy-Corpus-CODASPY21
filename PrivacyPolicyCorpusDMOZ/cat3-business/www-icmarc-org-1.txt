HomeAbout UsPolicies and DisclosuresICMA-RC PoliciesICMA-RC PoliciesThe information contained in sections such as MarketView is intended for use by ICMA-RC participants and employers, is for informational purposes only and is not investment advice. Reference to any fund or asset class on this site is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold that fund or asset class. ICMA-RC and its affiliates ("ICMA-RC") are not responsible for any investment action you may take as a result of this information or interpretation of this information.
Contact ICMA-RC Investor Services for applicable disclosure documents or prospectuses which contain more information on management fees, other fund expenses, and investment risks and objectives. You should read these documents before you invest. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ICMA-RC Investor Services may be contacted by calling -800-669-7400 or by writing to 777 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4240.
The Asset Class Guidance, Fund Advice and Managed Accounts services provided under Guided Pathways Advisory Services® are offered to participants through ICMA-RC, a federally registered investment adviser. As part of Guided Pathways Advisory Services, ICMA-RC has entered into a contract with Morningstar Investment Management LLC ("Morningstar Investment Management") to serve as the Independent Financial Expert. Morningstar Investment Management is a SEC registered investment adviser and wholly owned subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc., a global investment research firm that is not affiliated with ICMA-RC. ICMA-RC does not independently verify Morningstar data.
Availability
Account Access is normally available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, service availability is not guaranteed. Like other Internet-based services, Account Access may be subject to external transmission problems that are beyond the control of ICMA-RC. Accordingly, ICMA-RC will not be responsible for any loss (or foregone gain) you may incur as a result of service being unavailable or delayed.
Inability to Conduct Business
ICMA-RC is normally open for business and operating when the NYSE is open for business. However, unusual circumstances including, but not limited to, severe and extraordinary weather conditions, flooding, other natural disasters, pandemic flu or other health epidemics, regional power failures, fires, market disruption, civil disturbances or other emergencies may prevent ICMA-RC from conducting business on a given day or for longer periods of time. In such an event, transactions may be delayed and not effected until ICMA-RC resumes normal business operations. In addition, in some cases, ICMA-RC may be open for business but operating on a limited basis and may require that investment transactions and other orders or directions be sent via the internet through Account Access. ICMA-RC's Investor Services and Field Sales representatives also may be unable to take orders or instructions by telephone or in person, and the processing of orders or instructions sent by mail or facsimile may be delayed.
Account Access is normally available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for your convenience except during scheduled maintenance periods. However, service availability is not guaranteed. ICMA-RC is not responsible for any loss (or foregone gain) you may incur as a result of the service being unavailable.
ICMA-RC cannot and does not accept any financial responsibility or liability for market fluctuations in the value of a participant's investments that may occur while ICMA-RC is unable to conduct business as described above.
