LegalSmart print and document management systems are allowing legal firms to exceed client demands and stay competitive.
Traditionally, legal document management has involved cumbersome mountains of paper, case files and supporting records.
The subsequent processes for sorting and editing this documentation have been inefficient and costly.
In a fast moving digital age, firms are now looking beyond incremental digital improvements and are embracing the opportunity for widespread change and innovation.
Smart print and document management solutions are top of the wish lists of forward thinking legal firms – with Paper-Lite processes delivering wide ranging benefits.
To stand out in the age of the client, a ‘digital-first’ model which incorporates managed print services and document management systems will provide clear and far-reaching wins, helping firms become more responsive to client needs, improve productivity, enhance security, support collaboration and improve business resilience.
Control Costs
Typically, firms are unaware of the full scale of their print costs, or the print volumes of departments and individual team members.
A DMC Canotec service delivers business intelligence and transparency on all printing expenses and staff print volumes, as well as complete control of materials usage.
Improve Efficiency
Automated scanning and recognition software allows you to improve efficiency and deliver files easily to the appropriate fee earning teams, with minimal human intervention.
Process volumes of matter-centric documents, forms and statements in seconds, whilst integrating seamlessly into team workflows or directly into case, document or practice management software.
Go Paperless
A shift to service and information on demand is hampered by paper. Digitising documents allows knowledge workers to deliver on client expectations.
With a paper-lite system, electronic documentation can be captured and shared easily across multiple sites and teams, as well as filed directly into the relevant case, document or practice management systems.
Secure Your Workplace
Deliver improved client confidentiality and security around all elements of your document workflows.
DMC Canotec’s multilayered security features allow you to protect against unauthorised printing, copying and scanning, as well as incorporate secure document processing systems into your every day activities, protecting the firm, its clients and its people from inadvertent or deliberate data breaches.
Schedule your free print & document management audit
42% of law firms believe that the burden of maintaining legacy IT infrastructure is hampering growth.
36% of firms say that existing systems are neither agile or scalable enough to support future expansion.
64% of IT managers state that their printers are likely infected with malware.

Remove Bottlenecks

Access Files Remotely
Paper-lite practices enable digital files to be utilised for client meetings and remote working, reducing the need for large document bundles.
Improve Security
Flag unauthorised printing, scanning, copying and document access, plus blog hacking opportunities to MFDs in your organisation.
Enhance Client Experience
Smarter working practices allow matter-centric documentation to be digitally routed to recipients for action without delay.
