Buy Online & Pickup In-Store
Diesel accepts the following payment methods for online orders:
Credit or debit cards.
Paypal and Paypal Express.
Klarna.
PAYMENT WITH CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD
We accept payment by credit or debit cards issued by Visa, MasterCard or American Express.
We guarantee that every transaction on our website is secure. Payment and delivery data are collected through the most technologically advanced codification systems (TLS) and our store uses a VeriSign secure server and an ATW certificate to ensure maximum protection.
PAYMENT WITH PAYPAL
You can select PayPal as a payment method from the cart page. Simply click "PayPal Checkout" and log in using your PayPal credentials. After this, you will be prompted to enter your shipping and billing information.
If you do not have a PayPal account, you can create one quickly and safely by clicking REGISTER from the PayPal login page.
In case of Paypal Express purchases, you will have the chance to review all details before confirming and completing the order anyways.
In case you did not log in before paying with PayPal Express, you can review the order detail in the Order Status page that you can find in the Help Area, by using the email connected to your PayPal account and the order number.
PAYMENT CHARGES
For orders paid by credit card, you will be charged on the date the package is shipped.
For PayPal orders, your account will be charged on the date in which your order is placed.
PAYMENT WITH KLARNA
You can select Klarna as a payment method after entering your shipping and billing information. Klarna will be shown at checkout:
“SLICE IT” WITH KLARNA: Separate your purchase in 3 equal payment. The first payment will be collected from your card at the time of the order. The remaining two payments will be charged automatically after 30 and 60 days. Do not worry, you will receive a reminder when the payment must be completed and when it will be collected.
There are zero interests, commissions or costs for delayed payment – always.
If you have problems to complete the order with Klarna, it may be due to:
1. Klarna payments are subject to the user's financial circumstances. Klarna may have refused your payment request at a later time or later than 3. We advise you to choose another type or payment or to place an order for a lower amount.
2. You may have outstanding payments on previous Klarna purchases.
3. You may have lost a mandatory field at the cashier, for example by entering your date of birth.
Note that Klarna is an independent payment company and Diesel has no influence on whether or not to accept payment with Klarna.
