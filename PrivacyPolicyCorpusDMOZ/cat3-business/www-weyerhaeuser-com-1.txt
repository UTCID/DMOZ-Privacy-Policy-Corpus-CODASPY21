Strong Governance
Disciplined processes
SustainabilityStrong Governance
The work we do matters. We manage one of the most sustainable, versatile resources on Earth, and we’re experts at using trees to make products people need. That’s why it’s so important we carry out this work the right way so that our forests last forever, our mills continue operating and supporting communities across North America, and our company endures for another 100 years and beyond.
To ensure we can operate sustainably and deliver shareholder value over the long term, we follow sound corporate governance practices and adhere to robust compliance processes that are integrated into all our decision-making processes. By upholding integrity as a core value, reducing risk throughout our supply chain, and maintaining proactive board of directors oversight of our sustainability strategy, we ensure our ability to deliver value for investors, customers, employees and the communities where we live and work.
Maintaining Board Oversight of Sustainability
Our Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight on our sustainability strategy and annually reviews our performance and progress toward our many rigorous and measurable goals.
Leading with Good Corporate Governance
Our corporate governance practices and policies promote the long-term interests of our shareholders, strengthen the accountability of our board of directors and management, and help build public trust in our company.
Being Ethical and Transparent
Throughout our company’s history, integrity has remained a core value, and we view our reputation for doing business honestly as a competitive advantage.
Participating in Public Policy
Our ethical and transparent involvement in public policy includes coalition and relationship building, advocacy, political contributions and grassroots activities.
Ensuring Disciplined Risk Management
We use disciplined processes to manage our environmental, safety, social and public-policy risks so our leaders and employees can make safe and informed decisions.
Determining What’s Significant
To determine what's important to include in our sustainability strategy and reporting, we consider the relevance of environmental, social and governance topics to our company and how these topics affect our ability to create value.
MAINTAINING BOARD OVERSIGHT OF SUSTAINABILITY
Weyerhaeuser’s board of directors is focused on informed, thorough and proactive management of the company’s sustainability strategy over the long term.
The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight of our sustainability strategy, including matters related to climate change, and annually reviews our performance and progress toward our goals. The committee also provides oversight for environmental and safety matters, ethics and business conduct, political activities and human resources practices. Based on guidance from this committee, our chief administration officer has accountability for the implementation of our sustainability strategy.
We also complete an annual sustainability significance assessment, performance review and trend analysis. This assessment is managed by our corporate sustainability director and reviewed by our board of directors and senior management team.

LEADING WITH GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our corporate governance practices and policies promote the long-term interests of our shareholders, strengthen the accountability of our board of directors and management, and help build public trust in our company. Our governance framework is built on a foundation of written policies and guidelines, which we modify and enhance on a continuous basis to reflect best practices and feedback from our shareholders. Our corporate governance practices also align with the governance principles set out in the corporate governance framework established by the Investor Stewardship Group, or ISG, for U.S.-listed companies.
Some highlights from our corporate governance framework: 11 of our 12 board of director nominees are independent, all directors are elected annually, and the board chair and CEO roles are separate. We have a robust shareholder engagement process, shareholder proxy access, and shareholders have a right to call special meetings. We also have clear requirements on executive and director stock ownership, as well as a prohibition on hedging or pledging company stock.

BEING ETHICAL & TRANSPARENT
When Frederick Weyerhaeuser founded our company in 1900, he wanted to call it the Universal Timber Company. His partners overruled him, honoring their friend with a company name they felt carried a reputation for integrity. More than 120 years later, integrity remains a core value at our company, and we view our reputation for doing business honestly as a competitive advantage.
Our robust compliance and ethics program ensures our employees understand and follow our Code of Ethics, which describes our fundamental beliefs and expectations for ethical business conduct. Our employees also participate in regular compliance and ethics training, role-model and promote ethical behavior, and are instructed on how to communicate concerns of unethical behavior.

PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC POLICY
Our ethical and transparent involvement in public policy includes coalition and relationship building, advocacy, political contributions and grassroots activities. As active members of our communities, we participate in the political process to help shape policy and legislation affecting our company and industry and do so without regard of private political preferences of executives. All political contributions are managed by our government affairs team under a general delegation of authority from our general counsel. Public policy and legislative priorities are reviewed annually with senior business leaders and our board of directors' Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee.
Our political engagement is tied to our business strategies and is an important way to maintain our license to operate. Current issues of importance to us include:
Taxation of timberlands in the United States
Softwood lumber trade between the United States and Canada and trade policy in Asia
Forest management policies, conservation benefits of forest management and the use of herbicides in silvicultural practices
Energy policy, including the role of biomass in renewable energy policies
Climate policy, including impacts on manufacturing costs and positive recognition of sequestered carbon in forests and forests products
Clean air and water policies, including impacts on manufacturing processes and forest management activities
Green building programs and standards and recognition for the sustainable attributes of wood and forest products, including mass timber construction
Conservation of, and access to, the boreal forest and protection of caribou in Canada
Recognition for all credible forest certification standards
We follow both the letter and the spirit of the laws governing lobbying. Our managers receive regular training on current laws and practices, and we work fairly and honestly with public officials at all levels. We are members of more than 100 local, regional, provincial and national associations; some of our main associations are listed in our GRI Index 102-103.
Some states allow companies to contribute directly to campaigns for state and local offices and for ballot measures. We file these contributions as required at state and local levels. We also sponsor a U.S. Weyerhaeuser Political Action Committee, which solicits voluntary contributions from eligible shareholders, employees and our company board of directors. WPAC contribution reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission, and we provide a summary in our annual report of WPAC political donations. We disclose all our donations annually in our GRI Index 415-1.

ENSURING DISCIPLINED RISK MANAGEMENT
Making the right decisions for our business requires understanding risk. We use disciplined processes to manage our environmental, safety, social and public-policy risks so our leaders and employees can make safe and informed decisions.
Our annual enterprise risk assessment evaluates the likelihood of various risks and determines the potential magnitude of impact to our company. The analysis is conducted under the guidance of our chief compliance officer with assistance from other members of the management team and is reviewed by our board of directors. We share our business and industry risks in our annual report each year.
We conduct internal audits regularly to ensure compliance with environmental, safety, financial, disclosure and other regulations; voluntary standards; and our own company policies. When noncompliance issues are identified, we develop, implement and track corrective action plans to ensure timely resolution.
An independent public accounting firm audits our accounting processes, financial reporting and internal controls on an ongoing basis.
We also maintain and regularly update other company policies that guide our business, inform our employees, and help manage our identified risks, including the following:
Anti-Bribery Policy
Chemical Management Policy
Environmental Policy
Health and Safety Policy
Human Rights Policy
Product Stewardship Policy
Supplier Code of Ethics
Sustainable Forestry Policy
Threatened and Endangered Species Policy
Wood Procurement Policy
Back to Strong Governance Overview
DETERMINING WHAT’S SIGNIFICANT
We focus on environmental stewardship because our long-term success depends on a healthy, sustainable supply of trees — and it's the right thing to do. We also depend on strong relationships with our communities because their support and success allow us to continue operating. Perhaps most of all, we depend on a constant flow of diverse and talented people who are excited to join our team and build a rewarding career at our company.
To determine what is important to include in our sustainability strategy and reporting, we consider the relevance of the topics to our company and how those topics affect our ability to create value. For example, where we operate, what we make, and who we hire are topics relevant to our company. How we practice sustainable forest management, attract investors and employees, and make and sell our products affect our ability to create value. We solicit feedback from stakeholders throughout the year and review our assessment annually to ensure the identified topics are still relevant, significant and aligned with our companywide enterprise risk assessment.
We are an integrated forest products company, primarily selling directly to other companies. We do not outsource the making of our products or the management of our forests. That means most of our topics are significant only within the boundaries of our company. When we are reliant on entities outside our own boundaries, we discuss our relationship with those suppliers in the relevant portions of this website's sustainability and business sections.
We share our sustainability performance exclusively online. This section of our website is updated annually and serves as our company sustainability report.
