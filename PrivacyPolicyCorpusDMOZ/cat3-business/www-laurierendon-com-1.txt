Privacy policy
I know that confidentiality is important to all my clients and potential clients. I am committed to safeguarding your privacy.
I never give, sell, barter, or trade any information about you with anyone, without your express permission. In addition, I use all reasonable means to protect the confidentiality of any information you provide to me, including your name and the contents of any correspondence or manuscripts exchanged between us.
Sometimes I need to ask a trusted colleague or consultant to help with formatting or computer problems. When it is necessary to share a file with such persons, I hide or remove identifying information from the file if possible, and the third party is constrained by a similar privacy policy.
