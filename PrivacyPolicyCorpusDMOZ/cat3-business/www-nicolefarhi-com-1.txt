If required by law, we may need to collect and process your data.  For example, we may need to process personal data to comply with our legal obligations to share data with law enforcement or to comply with an order from the court.
Legitimate Interest
We process your data to our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
These legitimate interests include the following:
Direct Marketing and good customer Service
It is a legitimate of interest of our business to contact our customers for the purposes of direct marketing.
Subject to their marketing choices, we send customers who have transacted with us personalised communications in relation to new products and ranges and offers by email and we do so on the basis of our legitimate interests. Again, subject to their marketing choices, we also send our customers personal communications in relation to new products, new ranges and offers  by post on the basis of our legitimate interest.
We use the data we have to offer you promotions and products that are likely to be relevant to you.
You can, of course, decide not to receive any direct marketing from us.  Section 8 provides details as to how you can opt out of direct marketing from us or change your marketing preferences.
Surveys
From time to time, we may send you requests to take part in a customer survey to improve our products or your shopping experience.  It is entirely optional as to whether you wish to take part in any such survey.  These messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. We have a legitimate interest to do so as this helps make our products more relevant to you.
Of course, where we ask you for personal data to improve your shopping experience, it is always your choice as to whether you give us that information.  If you want to change how we use your data, please see the details in the section 8 of this policy.
