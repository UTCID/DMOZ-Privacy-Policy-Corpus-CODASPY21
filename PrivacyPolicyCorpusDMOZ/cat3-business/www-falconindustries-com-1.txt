Our Products
Helicoid Flight
Helicoid flight is a continuous one-piece helix formed from square or rectangle bar, round bar or cut plate.
Sectional Flight
Sectional flights are individual turns, wraps, or segments of wraps formed into a helix.
Ribbon Flight
Ribbon flight is a continuous, large diameter one-piece helix formed from bar or cut plate.
Shaftless Flight
Shaftless flight is heavier gauge helicoid flight that is produced to outside diameter and pitch specifications with an open center. This product works well when moving sticky products and large sized lumps.
Complete Screws
Falcon has the machining and assembly capabilities to manufacture the most complicated and demanding conveyor augers and mixing screws to our customers’ specifications.  Complete screw weldments or augers are produced by mounting helical or sectional flight to a shaft, pipe, flange, hub, posts or other means to turn the screw.
Maintenance & Repairs
One of the inherent problems associated with conveyor screws, augers and auger flighting is wear.  Falcon’s experience and expertise saves our customers time and money by repairing existing assemblies rather than building new.
