The General Data Protection regulations defines you as a «registrant» when you are an end user and identifiable individual with personal data processed.

In order to ensure compliance with our terms and conditions.
In order to maintain and further develop the Services.
In order to communicate with your regarding your subscription, editorial content and relevant offerings.
In order to provide, personalize and measure the effect of advertising.
More about purpose no.
1:
NHST Global Publications processes your personal data in order to be able to provide you with the Services and fulfil any customer agreements we have with you. This includes for instance giving you access to the Services, allowing you to administer your user and customer relations, delivering newspapers or magazines to your address, sending invoices and reminders to your email address, and informing you about important matters related to your customer relationship or the Services.
More about purpose no. 2:
NHST Global Publications also uses data about you to be able to personalize the Services to your user profile, for example by customizing some of the content that is shown to you. Profiling means that we create a profile on your user, based on information we have about you and your use of the Services. Through profiling we can personalize the content, adverts and marketing of NHST Global Publications’ Services, to make it more useful and interesting for you.
More about purpose no. 3:
Data about you is also used to prevent misuse of the Services. Misuse may be attempts at logging onto other people’s accounts, trying to swindle people, “spamming”, hate messages, harassment, and other acts that are forbidden according to relevant legislation and our terms and conditions.
More about Purpose no 4:
NHST Global Publications uses data about you and your use of the Services to make sure you get an optimal user experience, and to learn more about how we can and should develop the Services further.
More about purpose no. 5:
NHST Global Publications uses data about you for direct communication and marketing purposes through traditional channels like emails, text messaging, letters and telephone calls, unless you have opted out from such communication or in other ways have withdrawn your consent.
More about Purpose no. 6:
NHST Global Publications is partly financed by advertising revenue and is therefore dependent on providing, personalizeing and measuring the effect of adverts and other marketing in the Services. This is done internally at NHST Global Publications within the Group and in collaboration with third parties, for example like Google Ireland Ltd, as described in more detail in chapter 4-6 and in the paragraphs here.
The data are also used by us and our advertisers, restricted to the Services for profile and segment-based marketing, further developing targeted advertising products, programmatic advertising, automatic marketing, and so-called «retargeting».
By «Programmatic advertising» we mean automated trading of digital advertising via an exchange where we make available our ad impression inventory, and the advertisers can place bids on the impressions based on their criteria. Ads are served real-time. By «Retargeting» we mean repeated and targeted advertising towards an end-user.
3. Overview of NHST Global Publications’ processing basis
Any processing of personal data requires a legal basis. This means that before NHST Global Publications starts processing your personal data, we must ensure that we are entitled to carry out that processing (that NHST Global Publications has a legal basis). That basis may come directly from you for instance in the form of an agreement with us (for instance our subscription terms), or in the form of an active consent (for instance if you have accepted receiving offers via email from us while being a non-subscriber). Here is an explanation of what bases NHST Global Publications uses to process personal data and when we use them.
NHST Global Publications neither can, nor will we, process other personal data about you than what is expressly stated, and neither can nor will we do it in other ways than those described in this policy.
3.1 Agreement
If you are a registered user or an active user with NHST Global Publications, then NHST Global Publications must be able to process personal data on you in order to be able to fulfil the user agreement with you. It is only the processing that is necessary for meeting NHST Global Publications’ obligations under the agreement that is carried out with this processing basis.
What processing is necessary to fulfil the agreement will depend on the user agreement between you and NHST Global Publications. The user agreement will either be “Subscription terms and conditions” or “Terms for registered users”. The agreement will vary somewhat for end users, based on what kind of subscription is agreed. Your user agreement will be available and you should read it before you accept the agreement. The user agreement will also be accessible on your profile page, “My Page” and on subscription information pages on the websites.
One example of processing based on an agreement: If you have a subscription with NHST Global Publications for delivery of a newspaper to your door, NHST Global Publications needs to know the address the paper should be delivered to. Another example is that NHST Global Publications has to process personal data in order to have the correct invoice sent out and make sure it is paid.
3.1.1 Newsletters and notices
A daily newsletter and a weekly hand-picked selection of articles from the Editor-in-Chief is included in your subscription to any NHST Global Publications title. You may cancel these newsletters easily via the newsletters themselves. NHST Global Publications may also publish other types of newsletters and notices from our newsrooms, which you as a registered user can choose to sign up for. You will not receive such other types of regular newsletters unless you actively sign up for them. You control the sign-up or if you want to you can cancel it freely yourself on «My Page» or via the newsletter itself.
3.2 Legitimate interest
Moreover, NHST Global has a legitimate interest in some forms of processing, such as advertising purposes, marketing purposes etc. Such processing based on a legitimate interest applies to users with a registered profile or a subscription, or passive users (former subscribers) as described in chapter 1.3).
If you want to read more about the assessment NHST Global Publications has made, the balance test of your privacy weighed against NHST Global Publications’ legitimate interest, the measures implemented to reduce the risk of processing, and the conclusion on legitimate interest, you will find it in Appendix 1.
For end users with a user profile your settings on your Dashboard will show that the processing of your data that NHST Global Publications has a legitimate interest in carrying out, are “switched on”.
You have a right to «Opt out», which means that you are allowed reserve yourself against the processing, as described in point 8. This means that you can choose to switch off this processing in the settings on your Dashboard if you do not want NHST Global Publications to carry out the processing. Alternatively, you can always contact NHST Global Publications via the
Contact page.
NHST Global Publications does not have any terms and conditions linked to such opting out, but we would like to make it clear that the user experience of the Services may be affected for those who use their right to opt out or withdraw consent.
3.3 Consent
You are free to use the Services without giving us your consent to process your personal data. The Services may lose some functionality and user friendliness without certain consents. Another example is that we have to have consent to be able to send you good offers when you are no longer considered to be an active user.
Consent can also be regulated by you in your settings on the Dashboard, where you will get the opportunity to give consent, see what consents you have given before, and withdraw consents if you change your mind.
