Without limiting anything set out elsewhere in this Agreement, if a user views content or receives communications allegedly inconsistent with this Agreement, the user may send an e-mail to privacy@simon.com stating, in reasonable detail, the observed behavior.

remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the App.
The foregoing limited license is not a sale of the App, and we otherwise retain all rights, title and interest in and to the App. We may terminate your license to the App at any time, in our sole discretion. Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided by this Agreement, is void.

This Agreement, which include any specific terms appearing at discrete areas of the Platform, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Simon regarding the Platform. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
