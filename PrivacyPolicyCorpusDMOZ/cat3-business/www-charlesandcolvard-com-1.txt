These Terms are important and affect your legal rights, so please read them carefully. Note that Section 21 of these Terms contains a mandatory arbitration provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis and limits the remedies available to you in the event of certain disputes.
By accepting these Terms, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older and that, if you have accepted these Terms on behalf of any person or entity, you represent that you have legal authority to do so and that such person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or such person or entity violates these Terms.
If you do not agree to every provision of these Terms, you may not access, browse or use the Site or order, receive, or use products made available through the Site (the “Products”) or any services made available through the Site (collectively, the “Services”).

These Terms may be revised at any time for any reason, and Charles & Colvard may provide you notice of these changes by any reasonable means, including by providing notice through the Site. You can determine when we last updated the Site by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms.

If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may not access or use the Site or order, receive or use Products or Services made available through the Site.

2. Forward-Looking Statements
Statements included on the Site and the documents available through the Site may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements expressing expectations regarding our future and projections relating to products, sales, revenues and earnings are typical of such statements and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, representations and contentions and are not historical facts and typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “continue” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently.
All forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in predicting the future. You should be aware that, although the forward-looking statements included herein represent management’s current judgment and expectations, our actual results may differ materially from those projected, stated or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, our dependence on consumer awareness, acceptance and growth of sales of our products resulting from our strategic initiatives; our dependence on a limited number of customers; the impact of the execution of our business plans on our liquidity; our ability to fulfill orders on a timely basis; the financial condition of our major customers and their willingness and ability to market our products; dependence on our exclusive supply agreement with Cree, Inc. for the sole supply of the raw material; intense competition in the worldwide jewelry industry; our ability to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; our current wholesale customers’ potential perception of us as a competitor in the finished jewelry business; quality control challenges from time to time that can result in lost revenue and harm to our brands and reputation; general economic and market conditions; the risks of conducting business in foreign countries; the risk of disruption of our operations by natural disasters; the pricing of precious metals, which is beyond our control; the potential impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the risk of a failure of our information technology infrastructure to protect confidential information and to prevent security breaches; the impact of significant changes in e-commerce opportunities, technology or models; the failure to evaluate and integrate strategic opportunities; the possible adverse effects of governmental regulation and oversight; and the impact of anti-takeover provisions included in our charter documents, in addition to the other risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our most recent earnings release and our most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur except as required by the federal securities laws, and you are urged to review and consider disclosures that we make in the reports that we file with the SEC that discuss other factors relevant to our business.
3. Payment and Billing Information
By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your Order. In the event you want to change or update payment information associated with your Charles & Colvard account, you can do so at any time by logging into your account and editing your payment information.
4. Pricing and Availability
All prices are shown in U.S. dollars, and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice. We will not, however, be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes.
While we make every attempt to avoid errors in pricing and product information, some information (including prices) may be inaccurately displayed on the Site due to system or typographical errors. We reserve the right to correct any and all errors in pricing or product information when they occur, and we do not honor inaccurate or erroneous prices. If a Product’s listed price is lower than its actual price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping the product or cancel the Order and notify you of such cancellation. If the Order has been shipped, you agree to either return the Product (at your own expense) or pay the difference between the actual and charged prices.
All of our Products and Services are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order and to discontinue offering certain Products and Services without prior notice.
5. Taxes
Sales tax is applied in accordance with individual state regulations. Appropriate sales tax charges will appear on the Order page during checkout.
All items entering a foreign country are subject to customs inspection and assessment of duties and taxes in accordance with each country’s applicable laws. You are solely responsible for all duties and taxes incurred. Charles & Colvard cannot determine these fees during the checkout process. For more information, please contact your local customs office.
In the event that you refuse delivery of the shipment, you are solely responsible for payment of all return shipping charges, duties and taxes; in this case, return shipping charges, duties and taxes will be billed to you in accordance with the method of payment you selected in the checkout process.
6. Shipping and Handling
Separate charges for shipping and handling will be shown on the Order page during checkout. Please note that we do not ship to hotels or Post Office boxes. We require a signature upon delivery of all shipments.
You agree to pay any shipping and handling charges shown at the time you make a purchase. Shipping is handled by a third party courier. Actual delivery dates may vary. You agree that you will not obtain, or direct shipment of, a Product for export. All Products purchased from us are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that title to and the risk of loss of such Products passes to you upon our delivery of the Product to the third party courier.
7. Product Images
We have attempted to accurately depict the Products offered on this Site. However, because the color you see is dependent on your computer monitor, we cannot guarantee that the color you see will be accurate. The products may also appear larger or smaller than their actual size depending on your monitor. Some photographs of products may have been enlarged to show detail.
8. Deliveries
You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery.
9. No Resale
You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products or Services for commercial purposes.
10. Returns and Refunds
If you are dissatisfied with any Product you purchased through the Site, you may return the Product within sixty (60) days of the date you purchased the Product by contacting 877-202-5467 and following the shipping instructions we supply; provided, that all returned Products must be unused and in their original packaging. After we receive your returned Product, we will issue you a refund for the price you paid for the Product (less any applicable shipping and handling charges).
All returns require a return authorization number. Please contact Customer Service at (877) 202-5467 to obtain your personal return authorization number.
You may use the return shipping method of your choice, at your own expense. We strongly recommend that you use a carrier that offers shipment tracking for all returns and either insure your package for safe return or declare the full value of the shipment so that you are protected if the shipment is lost or damaged in transit. You are solely responsible for any loss or damage to the Product during shipping.
Upon receipt of a returned Product, we may take up to fourteen (14) business days to process your return.
If you do not comply with the terms of this section, you will be ineligible to receive a refund. We are unable to issue refunds for Services.
In order to offer the best shopping and product-return experience to as many guests as possible, Charles & Colvard, Ltd. reserves the right to limit purchase activity or place limitations on returns if we have reason to suspect misuse of our generous returns policy (such as excessive returns, reseller activity, or fraud).

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 1542, WHICH STATES “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH CHARLES & COLVARD AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, YOU AND CHARLES & COLVARD AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE FINALLY DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION GOVERNING, AS APPLICABLE, CONSUMER OR COMMERCIAL DISPUTES BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury); arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and result is subject to very limited review by courts. In an arbitration you have the right, at your expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief under these Terms that a court can award under these Terms. You and CHARLES & COLVARD agree that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in the United States in the same county and state as your billing address if a consumer dispute and otherwise in Wilmington, Delaware. CHARLES & COLVARD further agrees that your filing fee for an arbitration will be capped at the amount set by the American Arbitration Association. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and CHARLES & COLVARD are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and the termination of your use of the Services. REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM, YOU AND CHARLES & COLVARD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CHARLES & COLVARD agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
22. Modifications to the Site and Products
We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site (or any features or parts thereof) or the provision of any Products or Services at any time.
23. United States Only
The Site is controlled and operated by us from the United States of America, and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States of America. We do not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part of the Site, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Site’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.
24. Termination
Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Site and to order or receive and use the Products or Services, at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
25. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
Charles & Colvard operates the Site from its offices at 170 Southport Drive, Morrisville, North Carolina 27560, U.S.A. These Terms and the transactions they contemplate, including without limitation their interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, U.S.A., without reference to conflict or choice of law provisions, as applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such State.
