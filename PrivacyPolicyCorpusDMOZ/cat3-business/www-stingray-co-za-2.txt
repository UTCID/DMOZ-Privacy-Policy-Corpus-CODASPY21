Delivery Charges      Delivery charges may be applicable for your online order. All orders to a value of less than R400 incl. VAT or deliveries to outlying areas will attract a delivery surcharge.

Should       you accept the additional charges, payment may be made using payfast as in the original transaction.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the correct delivery address is provided during the ordering process – any additional delivery costs due to wrong or incomplete addresses will            be for your account. This applies to packages considered undeliverable (when there is no answer at provided address, or no-one authorised to accept the delivery) too.
PLEASE NOTE:           Delivery options only refer to business days, therefore an express overnight on a Friday will only arrive on the Monday.
Next day delivery is only applicable to orders placed before 12.30pm on a given day
