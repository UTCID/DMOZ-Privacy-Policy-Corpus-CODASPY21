Policy - Climate Change
Climate Change
Go Back
ITI and our member companies have established three strategic commitments in our efforts to address global climate change:
First, the tech sector aims to further reduce the carbon footprint of our operations by advancing corporate goals and policies that focus on conserving energy, reducing emissions of fossil fuels, and generating or using renewable energy whenever possible.
Second, ITI member companies commit to reducing the carbon footprint of our tech products over the course of their lifecycle.
Third, ITI and our member companies will help enable transformational innovation. In this regard, the Internet of Things (IoT) will transform our lives and economy in ways as significant as the Internet itself did over the past two decades.
IoT advances offer nearly limitless possibilities for incorporating smart technologies into our lives in ways that could not have been imagined even a few years ago. With smart cities, smart transportation, and other innovations, we are able to raise the quality of life in society, while decreasing our footprint on the Earth and its climate.
In addition to these strategic commitments, ITI will continue to support government policies that emphasize an innovation agenda for mitigating and adapting to our changing climate.
