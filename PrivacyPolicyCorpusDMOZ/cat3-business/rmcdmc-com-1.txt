corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise.
This may include Personal Information that you provide to us, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, gender and any payment details that you may provide us with.
Information we collect about you. Each time you use the Site, we may automatically collect the following information, which may be considered to be Personal Information when combined with other information about you:
IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs. This Site’s web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors. Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. This information is collected in an aggregate form only. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site’s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
Cookies. We may use a technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the Site. When you visit the Site, a cookie will be placed on your computer and when you visit the Site again, the cookie will help the Site recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor and that information along with information about other visitors to the Site collected using cookies help provide us with an understanding of how visitors to the Site use the Site (e.g., which pages of the site are most visited and whether a particular user tends to go to certain sections of the Site more than others). We utilize two types of cookies – “session” and “persistent”. A persistent cookie continues to collect information about your visits and behavior on the Site each time you visit the Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. For example, if you use a standard browser, you should have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate). For more information on modifying your browser preference, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. You can also visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu for comprehensive information on how to manage cookies.
Pixel Tags. We and our service providers may also use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened.
How Information We Collect Is Used

Where We Store Your Personal Information
To make the Site available to you or to provide any services to you via the Site, we may share your Personal Information within the RMC (Rocky Mountain Connections Inc.) group of companies. If you are located in the EEA, this may involve transferring your Personal Information outside of the EEA. Many of our external third parties are based outside of the EEA so their processing of your Personal Information will involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.
Wherever we transfer your Personal Information outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission. For further details see here.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give Personal Information the same protection it has in the EEA. For further details, see here.
Where we use providers based in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Information shared between the EEA and the USA. For further details, see here.
Please contact us at privacy@rmcdmc.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.

They will only process your Personal Information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. While RMC (Rocky Mountain Connections Inc.) takes all appropriate steps to safeguard Personal Information under our control, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that Personal Information supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
