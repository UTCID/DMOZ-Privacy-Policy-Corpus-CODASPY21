Use of Cookies
The NextSigma Inc. Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
to a specific page. For example, if you personalize NextSigma Inc. pages, or
register with NextSigma Inc. site or services, a cookie helps NextSigma Inc.
to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
and so on. When you return to the same NextSigma Inc. Web site, the information
you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the NextSigma Inc.
features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
the interactive features of the NextSigma Inc. services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
NextSigma Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. NextSigma Inc. secures the personally identifiable information
you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit
card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use
of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
NextSigma Inc. will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect
company and customer feedback. NextSigma Inc. encourages you to periodically
review this Statement to be informed of how NextSigma Inc. is protecting your
information.
