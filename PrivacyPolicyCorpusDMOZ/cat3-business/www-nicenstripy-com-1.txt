What our clients say...
"We wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for grass cutting"
An unexpected storm brought down four of our garden fence panels, and having three small children and a garden that backs onto an alleyway, it was important for us to get it fixed quickly. Nicenstripy came out swiftly and fitted our new fence, and even quoted for a lawn treatment while they were there. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.
"The garden maintenance team at nicenstripy deliver exactly what we want"
We've used nicenstripy for loads of small jobs over the years, from small-scale lawn care solutions in our front garden to bigger projects like a long overdue clear out in the back garden. Every time our expectations are smashed, and the team at nicenstripy deliver exactly what we want.
"I would definitely recommend them for all grass cutting"
I have found nicenstripy to be extremely professional. They turn up for grass cutting when they say they will and my lawn has never looked better! We tried other grass cutting services and none were as good as the guys at nicenstripy! I would definitely recommend them for all grass cutting and garden maintenance.
"They do all my garden maintenance"
The most important thing I look for from my garden maintenance company is quality and reliability. I cannot fault nicenstripy. Since they have been cutting and treating my lawn, it has never looked better. In fact now they do all my garden maintenance and it has taken all the stress out of gardening. I can potter around doing the fun jobs, leaving nicenstripy to make sure the garden is well maintained!
"They were punctual, friendly and got on with the lawn care well"
Darren and his colleague transformed our scrappy, lumpy back garden into a beautiful lawn! They were punctual, friendly and got on with the job well. They put in a play bark pit around our climbing frame and accommodated my last-minute request for a raised bed for a veggie patch without a problem. They worked hard - especially as access to our garden limited the delivery of topsoil - so a lot of wheelbarrowing was necessary. Darren was also happy to do extras make sure the job was done properly (re-attaching the slide, fixing the garden gate (see my review of fencing in May)
"Would use again for repairing fencing and recommend to friends"
Responded promptly to a request for a quote which was reasonably priced. Arrived on time, removed the old broken fence. New fence installed with quality materials. All old materials removed from site, left clean and tidy. Would use again and recommend to friends. A job very well done, thank you.
"I would definitely recommend them for garden maintenance"
The work was done efficiently and in good time. Paul was friendly and the work was very well done and all the rubbish was removed. And Paul gave advice on maintaining the hedges. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and will use them again. Thank you.
"They also can do odd jobs such as gutter clearing and power washing"
Paul and his crew have been taking care of our weekly lawn maintenance for over two years now. The guys are all hardworking, polite and take huge pride in their work. Best of all, it shows. They also can do odd jobs such as gutter clearing and power washing.
"Honest, reliable, garden maintenance, an extremely nice family firm"
Mr Burchett was able to provide a very competitive estimate for clearing a community garden and boundary hedges. He arrived on the specified date and carried out all the works quoted for and cleared up afterwards. He and his colleagues are quiet and hardworking.
I would recommend Nicenstripy to anyone.
"Winter garden tidy up"
Each year we ask nicenstripy to do an annual tidy up and each year they do an excellent job. I would definitely recommend them.
"Grass and hedge cutting"
We use nicenstripy all throughout the spring/summer months for grass cutting and hedge trimming, they are always happy to take on extra tasks at short notice. Very good work - Very reliable. I would highly recommend them.
