Policy - Purchasing Green Products
Purchasing Green Products
Go Back
ITI members lead efforts to design sustainable products and promote the purchase of these “green” electronics: products that provide superior energy and environmental performance across their complete lifecycles. To achieve this, ITI engages in internationally accepted standards to objectively determine what constitutes a “green” product; works with the U.S. government and other institutional purchasers to establish environmentally preferable purchasing programs for electronics; and participates in cross-industry efforts to drive continuous improvement.
