Save Your Sanity: Help for Handling Hijackals®.
The best way to get the advice you need is to ask a question. I love to answer questions about real-life relationship issues, because that’s a lot more helpful for everyone. You are going through something that is unique to you, but also, not as uncommon as you might think. Sharing your story gives others the comfort to know they are not alone in their struggle, and also gives you an opportunity to put words to your feelings and experiences which helps you process them… and let them go. I’d really like to hear your story and share it with listeners and members (anonymously if you prefer), to help us all move forward.I talk on air about real questions, real situations, and real stories of life with a Hijackal. You can talk with me on air, and tell your story, too.Or, if you’re not ready to talk on air, you can send me your question, and I’ll answer it on air. This is the place to do that.
So, submit your question, or your story. The form below will guide you.
