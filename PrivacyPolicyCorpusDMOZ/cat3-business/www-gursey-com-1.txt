Your use of our website is completely anonymous.

Our web content is suitable for all ages, but we require that any information submitted be done by someone over 18. However, if your minor child is very interested in forensic accounting and advanced tax law, we recommend signing them up for AYSO Soccer or some other outdoor activity.
So in summation: we won’t look at your stuff, we won’t ask you for stuff, if you give us stuff we won’t sell it, and our stuff is safe for all ages.
