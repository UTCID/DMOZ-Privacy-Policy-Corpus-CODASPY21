Dakine will have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged.

Limitation of Liability
Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Dakine be liable to you for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if Dakine has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Dakine is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Dakine’s liability will in no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six months prior to the date of the initial claim made against Dakine or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Dakine, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Dakine by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.
Violation of These Terms of Use
Dakine may collect, capture or disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) or communications from you if we determine that such disclosure is necessary to any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Dakine’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Dakine’s customers. Dakine reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Dakine deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, to enforce these Terms of Use, to respond to claims that you violated the rights of others (including Dakine or its employees, users, or visitors). Dakine also may disclose your information when Dakine determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.
You agree that Dakine may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Dakine, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Dakine obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Dakine deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Dakine may have at law or in equity. If Dakine does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms of Use, Dakine will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Dakine. You agree that Dakine will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.
You agree that Dakine may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.
Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the European Union without regard to its conflicts of law’s provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the courts of France, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Dakine and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties will attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties will be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.
Void Where Prohibited
Dakine administers and operates the Site from its location in Hood River, Oregon, in the United States of America; other Dakine sites may be administered and operated from various locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Dakine reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature, product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.
Miscellaneous
If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Dakine with regard to your use of the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Dakine with respect to such use are hereby superseded and canceled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Dakine, Dakine will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Dakine’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver by Dakine of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor will any course of conduct between Dakine and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use will not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.
Dakine provides access to Dakine International data and, therefore, may contain references or cross references to Dakine products, programs and services that are not announced in your country. Such reference does not imply that Dakine in your country intends to announce such products, programs or services.

Any feedback you provide at this site will be deemed to be non-confidential. Dakine will be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.
