We may assign Your computer or mobile device one or more cookies to facilitate access to the Services, and to personalize Your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer or mobile device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A flash cookie is similar to a cookie, but it can store more complex data in order to remember settings, preferences, and usage. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once You close Your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on Your devices until You delete them) to: (1) allow You to use the Services without having to re-enter Your user name and password; (2) provide You with a more personal and interactive experience; (3) monitor usage of the Services; (4) manage the Services; and (5) improve the Services. These cookies may be delivered by Us or by third parties.

Social Media
The Website, the Welch Allyn Home Website, and the Welch Allyn Home App interface with social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, and may use social media plugins (such as the Facebook "Like" button) to facilitate social media functions. When You visit the Website or the Welch Allyn Home Website, or use the Welch Allyn Home App, the operator of a social media plugin may set cookies or other tracking technology on Your browser, enabling that social media operator to recognize individuals who visit the Website, the Welch Allyn Home Website, or use the Welch Allyn Home App. If You are logged into a social media website while browsing on the Website or the Welch Allyn Home Website, or using the Welch Allyn Home App, the social media plugins may allow the social media website to receive information about Your visit, including the pages that You viewed, and connect the visit to Your User Information.
The social media plugins also allow the social media website to share information about Your activities on the Website, the Welch Allyn Home Website, or the Welch Allyn Home App with other users of their social media website. For example, Facebook social media plugins allow Facebook to show Your Likes and comments on the Website, the Welch Allyn Home Website, and Welch Allyn Home App to Your Facebook friends. Your use of social media plugins is subject to each social media website's privacy policy, so We encourage You to use care and thoughtfully read the privacy policy of each social media website that You use. We have no control over the information that social media websites or plugins collect, store, or use.

For example, third parties and service providers working with Us may handle the processing of credit card payments, shipping, customer service, data management, e-mail distribution, market research, information analysis, promotions management, social media marketing, and similar services.

We also may share or sell aggregated, de-identified data with partners and the public in a variety of ways, such as by providing research or reports about medical health. When We provide this information, We perform appropriate procedures so that the data does not identify You or Your patients or clients and We contractually prohibit recipient of the data from re-identifying it back to You or Your patients or clients.
Security
We are committed to taking reasonable efforts to secure the information that We collect, and We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect against unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. We restrict access to User Information to certain individuals and organizations that need to know the information in order to operate, develop, or improve Our services.
