COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
Personal Information
Westone may ask you to register and provide personal information, such as when you purchase products from our online store, register new products, access product information, features or programs, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or sign into a page that requires authorization. Westone may also collect credit card information to bill you for products and services that you purchased. This personal information may include your name, e-mail address, user ID, domain name, URL, mailing address, and telephone number. Westone may also collect demographic information such as your age, gender, zip code/postal code, education level, household income, operating system, preferences, interests, favorites, and whether you are a personal or business user. If you choose not to register and provide this information, you can still use most of Westone’s Web site. Unfortunately, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.
Children's Personal Information
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have such personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.
System Configuration Information
Westone automatically collects on our server logs certain information about your computer hardware and software when you visit our Web site or use Westone’s online services. This information may include such things as your IP address, cookie information, globally unique identifier, system, operating system, a description of any Westone products connected and how such products are used, browser type, domain names, access times, service provider and referring Web site addresses.
Web Site Usage Information
Westone and its third party service providers track non-personally identifiable information about how you use our website through cookies, globally unique identifiers, Internet tags or web beacons in the aggregate, and track navigational data (log files, server logs, click stream). These allow us to track how you interact with Westone online, and, with your permission, we can tie this information to your personal information to help us tailor communication to you.

Westone also keeps track of the pages you visit within our Web site and any transaction details (downloads, orders, requests, or referrals).

We also may internally compare lists collected from our other sites or within our family of companies to remove duplicate entries.
E-Mail Messaging
Westone will periodically send our registered users e-mail messages about our products and services. When sending you e-mail, we may use an image called a single pixel GIF that allows us to format messages tailored to your computer’s capabilities. We also use this technology to determine, in the aggregate, how many people open our e-mails.

We then record your individual response to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your interests.
