Dolly Terms of ServiceLast Revised: April 22, 2015Welcome to Dolly—the app from Dolly, Inc. ("Dolly," "we," "us," or "our") that connects you with vehicle owners (each, a "Helper") who will move your stuff wherever you want.These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your access and use of the mobile application (the "App"), website ("Site") and other online products and services (collectively, the "Dolly Platform") of Dolly.Accepting these TermsBY DOWNLOADING THE APP OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE DOLLY PLATFORM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS BELOW. Please read all of the terms before you use the Dolly Platform. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, you may not use the Dolly Platform.ModificationsWe reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. For example, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed about our practices.Whenever we make changes to these Terms, they are effective when the revised Terms are posted unless we notify you otherwise. If you continue to use the Dolly Platform after the revised Terms have been posted, then you will be deemed to have accepted the changes to these Terms.Privacy PolicyFor information about how we collect, use and share information about users of the Dolly Platform, please see our Privacy Policy at https://dolly.com/privacy.Description of the Dolly PlatformThrough the Dolly Platform, you can submit a request (a "Request") for a Helper to pick up the item(s) you specify (each, an "Item") for loading, unloading, moving, hauling, packing, lifting, assembly or disassembly (the "Services"). You will receive price quote for the fee that will apply to completing your Request (the "Services Fee"). Once you submit the payment information for the Request, your Request will be sent out to our network of Helpers. You will receive a notification through the Dolly Platform when a Helper has accepted your Request, and you will be able to communicate with that Helper through the Dolly Platform to confirm and coordinate certain logistics involved with completing your Request.You represent and warrant that the Items related to any Request are your personal property and you have all right, title and permission to request and allow the loading, unloading, moving, packing, or lifting of any Items, and that the performance of the Services by a Helper will not result in the violation of any third party's ownership or privacy rights.For more information about the Dolly Platform, please see our Customer Knowledge Base.Creating AccountsWhen you create an account you must maintain the security of your password and accept all risk that someone may access your account without your permission. If you discover or suspect any Dolly Platform security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible. You represent and warrant to us that all information that you provide in connection with your account is accurate, truthful, current and complete. Dolly reserves the right to deny any account at our discretion.Payment for ServicesYou must provide credit card information to submit a Request. You are responsible for paying the applicable Services Fee for any completed Services. Once you submit a Request, we will place a temporary hold on the credit card account you provided in an amount equal to 100% of the applicable Services Fee. Once you and the Helper have verified that the Services are completed, you will have the option of paying an additional gratuity (a "Tip") to the Helper, and your credit card account will be charged for the sum of the Services Fee, any Tip, and the fees for any additional services you may request.You agree to make all payments to the Helper through the Dolly Platform and will not pay any Helper in cash or means other than directly through the Dolly Platform.Canceling a RequestIf you cancel any Request: (a) before a Helper accepts it, or (b) after it has been accepted by a Helper but more than 24 hours before the Services are to be performed, you will not be charged, and the hold will be lifted on your credit card. If you cancel any Request less than 24 hours before the Services are to be performed, your credit card account will be charged 20% of the applicable Services Fee.In the instance where the Helper attempts to fulfill the Request but cannot do so for reasons out of the Helper's or Dolly's control, your credit card will be charged 50% of the applicable Services Fee.Right to Use the Dolly PlatformOn the condition that you fully comply with these Terms, Dolly grants you a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to access and use the Dolly Platform for your own personal, non-commercial use.

If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Seattle, Washington. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Dolly are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Dolly will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Seattle, Washington. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.For any disputes that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms or the use of the Dolly Platform.GeneralEnforcement of these Terms is solely at Dolly's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. The section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.These Terms (and the other policies and terms referred to above) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Dolly Platform and the Services, and they supersede any prior agreements that may have been made.Contact UsIf you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at support@dolly.com or send a letter to:Dolly, Inc.901 5th Ave Ste 600Seattle, WA 98164Notice for California UsersIf you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms.
