Personal Data We Collect
You may choose to give us personal data to allow us to communicate with you, process your orders, provide you with services, or for employment consideration. Data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Xerox, the choices you make, including your privacy settings, and the products and features you choose. The personal data we collect can include the following:
Name and Contact Data. Your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number and other similar contact data in order to communicate with you, process orders or provide you with products or services. We may also collect your employer name, if you are procuring products or services on behalf of an organization.

Precise location data can be obtained through Global Navigation Satellite System data, as well as through nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots when you enable location-based products or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your device or data that indicates where you are located with less precision, such as an internet protocol (IP) address or a city or postal code.
Social Media Data. We may provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social networks. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you by the social networking site. Please review the privacy policies and settings of social networks you use to understand their practices.
Job Applications/CVs/Resumes. Professional, education and employment-related information on job applications/CVs/resumes which you provide to us if you submit a job application to Xerox either directly or indirectly, which may include sensitive personal data. Xerox uses this information in order to evaluate your application and perform related employment activities.
Feedback and Product Reviews. Information you provide to us and the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, blog posts or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you contact us via our website, a Xerox application or a Help Desk, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded. Your feedback, posts and reviews will be used to seek improvements in our products and services.
Website Browsing and Commercial Information. Information about your visits to our websites and your browsing patterns, including inferences drawn from this information. This may include information related to your prior purchases and online buying preferences or data about your device, including IP address, browser type, and regional and language settings. This is more fully described under the section entitled “Cookies, Web Beacons and Privacy Choices” below. We collect this information to determine such things as the number of visitors to various parts of our websites, to personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you.
Products. Certain Xerox products collect data, such as product registration, device serial number, meter reads, supply levels, equipment configuration and settings, software version, and fault codes. Xerox uses this information for product improvement, billing, report generation, supplies replenishment and support services.

Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect;
Social networks when you grant permission to a Xerox product to access your data on one or more networks;
Designated entities within your business or enterprise (such as a member of your IT department) in the course of providing services to you;
Partners with whom we offer branded services or engage in joint marketing activities. If you purchase Xerox services or products from a Xerox partner we may receive certain information about your purchase from that partner;
Fraud prevention agencies or credit reporting agencies in connection with credit determinations; and
Publicly available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.
How We Use Personal Data
We collect and process personal data with your consent, as required by law, or as necessary to fulfill the legitimate interests or business purposes of Xerox, including to: (i) provide you with products and services; (ii) manage, administer and operate our business; (iii) meet our contractual and legal obligations; (iv) carry out direct marketing; (v) prevent fraud; and (vi) protect the security of our systems and our customers.

How We Share Personal Data

For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in maintaining or servicing business accounts or products via our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In addition, we may share information with third parties for the joint offering of a product or service. In such cases, these companies are required by contract to abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
Protect our customers, for example to prevent attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; or
Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
Where We Process and Store Personal Data
Personal data collected by Xerox may be transferred to, stored and processed in your region, the United States, or any other country in which Xerox or its subsidiaries, affiliates, sub-contractors, agents or partners maintain facilities.

Our privacy guidelines are communicated to Xerox employees on an annual basis as part of our mandatory training program. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located. Sometimes we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries.

Xerox websites store personal data in password-protected environments on servers that are subject to Xerox's information security policies, standards, and procedures.

When we transmit sensitive personal data such as a password over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.
To ensure that you can purchase with confidence from Xerox websites, Xerox protects credit card information submitted online with industry-standard encryption technology or tokenization.
Our Agents and Partners Protect Personal Data
