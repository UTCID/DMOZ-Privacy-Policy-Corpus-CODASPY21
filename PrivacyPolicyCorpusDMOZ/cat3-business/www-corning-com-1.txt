Corning Incorporated Internet Data Protection Notice
Corning Incorporated (“Corning,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is committed to safeguarding your data protection online. How your personal data will be processed during your use of Corning’s websites is outlined below.
All of the personal data you submit is collected by Corning Incorporated, and may be shared with one or more local Corning entity (ies) located in your country of residence (according to what you provided in the collection form). Both Corning Incorporated and the relevant local Corning entity(ies) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Corning”) are acting as Joint Data Controllers in respect of your personal data collected through your use of Corning’s websites. Please click here to view the names and contact details of all relevant Corning entities.
Corning has implemented a set of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) to establish safeguards to ensure that personal data is protected while transferred within the Corning group. The implementation of BCRs provides an adequate level of protection for the personal data transfers carried out from the Corning European Economic Area (EEA) entities to the other Corning entities located in non-EEA countries throughout the world as they are drafted in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)1 requirements. The approval of Corning’s BCRs was led by the French supervisory authority, the CNIL, with secondary input from the German state of Hessen and Poland’s supervisory authorities.
From time to time, we may make changes to this notice to reflect changes in our business or to serve you better. Corning will make reasonable efforts to publish any such changes in this notice, such as posting on this website. You should review this notice periodically to stay informed of any changes. Please note the date of the notice below, so that you know when it was last updated.
