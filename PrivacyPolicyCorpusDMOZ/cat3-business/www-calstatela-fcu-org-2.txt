The Law Offices of David N. Weiss provide Group Legal Service to our members
The plan works like this:
You can talk by phone or in person with an attorney for legal advice.
There is no cost to you for the initial consultation. This is a benefit provided to you by Cal State L.A. Federal Credit Union.
If it is necessary to prepare legal documents, letters, file a lawsuit, court defense, etc., the attorney will discuss this with you and quote you a fee in advance. You can use their service or seek another attorney.
The fees are charges at a reduced rate. All matters are confidential.

Accidents
Divorce, Custody, Support
Wills, Trust, Probate
