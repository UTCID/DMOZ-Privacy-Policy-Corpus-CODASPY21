Except as noted herein, New Pig does not sell or share your Personal Information with any person or entity outside of New Pig.
We may disclose certain portions of your Personal Information to analytics providers, advertising networks, and other service providers or third parties for certain business purposes as identified above, and receive something of value in exchange for this disclosure.
As referenced in the table of Personal Information we collect, use and share, the Site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, analyze how visitors and customers interact with our Site, and for other purposes disclosed above. We may employ other companies to provide similar marketing services on our behalf. With our approval, these third parties may also place “cookies” for analysis purposes. These third-party companies will have access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that information for any other purpose. We do not use cookies to store credit card information or other financial information. You are not required to accept cookies. However, certain functionality of the Site may not work properly (if at all) if you reject cookies.
Depending on where you reside, the disclosure of your cookie identifiers, including your IP address, in exchange for certain third-party services may be considered a sale of your Personal Information, and you may have the right to opt-out of any such sale of your Personal Information by New Pig.
This Site may use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, which are web analytics services that use cookies to analyze your use of our Site. The information collected by these cookies about your use of the Site (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information to assess your use of the Site, providing reports on data such as how often you visit, what pages you view when you visit, and what other websites you have visited prior to visiting our Site.

You can opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by us or on our behalf by clicking here.
If you opt-out, you will still see ads but they will not be personalized based on your online activity. Please note that if you disable your cookies or upgrade your browser after opting out, you will need to opt-out again. Further, if you use multiple browsers or devices you will need to execute this opt-out on each browser or device.
You can also generally opt-out of receiving targeted ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by visiting http://optout.networkadvertising.org/.

Your Rights and Choices
Depending on where you reside, you may have one or more of the following rights with regard to New Pig’s collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information:
• The right to request that we disclose what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose or sell about you;
• The right to request the deletion of Personal Information we have collected or maintain about you;
• The right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information; and • The right not to receive discriminatory treatment by New Pig, in terms of the services and prices offered on or through our Services, because you exercised these rights regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information.
If you would like to access, review, edit, delete or have us properly dispose of any copies of the Personal Information that New Pig collected about you (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), if you would like to opt-out of receiving further information or limit what we share, or if you would like to exercise the above rights in any other way, please contact us at privacy@newpig.com or call us at 1-800-HOT-HOGS (1-800-468-4647).
You may be able to opt-out of New Pig sharing your Personal Information with the entities identified in this Policy by sending us an email at the address above, unless the sharing of your Personal Information is necessary to perform one of the following business purposes: to count ad impressions and evaluate their effectiveness; to detect, protect against, and prosecute security incidents; to debug or troubleshoot functional errors that may arise with the Services; to complete short-term tasks related to an existing interaction you have with New Pig; to maintain or service your account; to process payments and fulfill orders or other transactions you authorize; to verify your customer information; and to ensure the safety and quality of the Services.
New Pig will do its best to accommodate any request to delete or properly dispose of any copies of your Personal Information, but we cannot guarantee we can eliminate all Personal Information from the specified uses. Therefore, please be as specific as possible in any request to delete or dispose of copies of your Personal Information. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
1.	Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise to perform a contract we entered into with you;
2.	Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
3.	Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
4.	Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
5.	Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546);
6.	Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
7.	Enable solely solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
8.	Comply with a legal obligation; or
9.	Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
If you choose to delete certain portions of your Personal Information, it may affect your ability to use certain New Pig Services. If the request relates to information that New Pig needs to make the Site or other Services function properly for you, you may no longer be able to use those Services. Any removal of content by New Pig does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the content in all places. The content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information.
You may grant an authorized agent written permission to submit requests regarding your Personal Information, but we may deny authorized agent requests absent proof that you authorized such agent to act on your behalf, or if we are unable to verify your identity.
New Pig is required to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information. If you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other consumer requests, New Pig will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of personal information we store about you before responding to your request. If you would like to request the specific pieces of your personal information that New Pig has collected, or if you would like us to delete highly sensitive information, you will need to match at least three pieces of information we store about you, and you must provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information you are requesting.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
New Pig reserves the right to maintain proper business records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain portions of your Personal Information.
If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from New Pig, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send New Pig a detailed email at privacy@newpig.com
Some browsers also have a ”do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, and New Pig will attempt to treat such technical signals as valid opt-out requests for online tracking related to targeted advertising. To learn more about other ways to opt-out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website. Options you select are browser- and device-specific.

Securing Personal Information
New Pig employs industry best practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personal Information such as firewalls and authentication protection. New Pig will periodically review its security policies and implement changes from time to time. However, we cannot and do not guarantee complete security, as it does not exist on the internet. While New Pig takes the issue of protecting your Personal Information seriously, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose or transmit to the Site. If you are concerned about sending information to New Pig over the internet, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements.
New Pig retains collected information for a reasonable amount of time in order to fulfill the stated purpose for why the information was collected. New Pig will also retain collected information connected to business records for periods of time required by law. If New Pig determines that collected information is no longer needed, it will delete such information. Our collection times will be consistent with applicable law.

Children's Privacy
New Pig’s Services are intended for individuals 18 years of age and older. Our Services are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 16 years of age. New Pig does not knowingly collect or sell any information, including Personal Information, from children under 16 years of age. If New Pig learns that it has collected any information regarding a person younger than 16 years of age, New Pig will delete or destroy the information immediately.
If there is concern that information regarding a person younger than 16 years of age was somehow collected by New Pig, any minor, or the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of such minor, who wishes to request the removal of the minor’s information should submit their request by using the contact details provided in the “Contacting New Pig Corporation” section below.
^Top
Non-U.S. Concerns
The Services are meant for individuals within the United States. New Pig only knowingly collects information from individuals within the United States. If you provide information to New Pig from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk. If you are outside of the United States, you are responsible for complying with any local laws regarding use of the Services, and related data collection. You also agree and acknowledge that by providing any information, including Personal Information, through the Services, that such information will be transmitted to, and stored in, the United States.
