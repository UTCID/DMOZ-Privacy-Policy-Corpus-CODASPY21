Cybersecurity
Software innovation continues to connect people across the world and transform daily business practices. These online connections create efficiencies and spur economic growth, but they also create vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit if the proper security measures are not in place. Addressing cybersecurity challenges requires innovative practices and tools to defend the integrity, privacy, and resilience of the Internet ecosystem.
BSA supports efforts to improve governments and industries capabilities and readiness to address cybersecurity threats. This includes promoting a secure software ecosystem, strengthening cybersecurity workforce capabilities, supporting policies that enable the development of cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies, and other steps to secure and defend information infrastructure.
