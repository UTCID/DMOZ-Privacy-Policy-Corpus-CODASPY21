Privacy Statement
Important information regarding our privacy policy
Policy
CCA has an obligation to protect and maintain confidential member information.
CCA will establish adequate controls to ensure that member information is properly protected, confidential and used as agreed with the member.
CCA promises that if it wants to use member information for purposes other than its own internal business purposes, such as cross marketing products of another organization or firm, then the member will be told and given the opportunity to limit such use, or "opt out". It should be noted that CCA's present policy is that it will not sell member information to others.
CCA Information and Announcements
CCA provides its members a forum to keep abreast of emerging and topical compliance issues in the financial industry. CCA may send you materials that may assist you in your continued professional development, such as special offers and announcements of compliance-related events. Such mailings will be originated by CCA; we do not sell our membership information to third parties.
We are committed to protecting your privacy and will not share your membership information with third parties. If you prefer not to receive such mailings, email us or mail your request to:
