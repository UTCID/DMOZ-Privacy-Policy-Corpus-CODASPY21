Cadence Group’s President and CEO Tina Teree Baker, IGP spoke to Women Business Owners on Business Management about data privacy during COVID-19 at a Woman Impacting Public Policy (WIPP) web-conference at 2pm on April 6th. Ms.Baker speaks locally and nationally on the topic of information governance, security, compliance.
As the pandemic spreads and continues to affect daily life, small businesses in particular need to be prepared to manage business processes, records, and data privacy while suddenly having all, or many, employees work from home to protect their health
Managing Business Processes to Protect Data Privacy during COVID-19
Ms. Baker’s presentation at 2pm was titled “COVID-19: Managing Processes, Records, and Data Privacy”. She will use this time to speak about how to properly upkeep facilities during the pandemic, and best practices to manage and utilize remote workers across the business. This includes a discussion on adjusting business processes to support the fast-track to working from home, related records and data privacy risks, as well as how businesses can mitigate those risks. Just because business processes have to change does not mean they should be any less efficient or compliant with IT and security policies.
