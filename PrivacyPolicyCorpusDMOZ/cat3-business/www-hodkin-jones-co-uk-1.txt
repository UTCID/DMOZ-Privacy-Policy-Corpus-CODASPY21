Why Choose Us
Restoration and Matching
Hodkin and Jones can recreate and match any plaster moulding, no matter how complicated the design is.
We pride ourselves on over 150 years’ experience within the historical restoration service and have worked on a range of properties, varying in type and period, undertaking surveys, restoration and repairs to restore them to their former glory.
Our special contracts department can provide a bespoke service restoring plasterwork to the most delicate of projects including listed buildings, public buildings such as theatres, city and town halls, as well as commercial and residential properties.
Some fibrous plaster mouldings are readily available to replace missing sections and Hodkin and Jones will reproduce plasterwork using moulds taken from existing items. If you are looking for mouldings to match original designs already in your home, or for something more specific, Hodkin and Jones will make them to match.
Fibrous plaster is the perfect material for mouldings as it can be used for both mass-produced and bespoke designs and can easily be re-sized and shaped in the production process.
To arrange a site survey call our office on 01246 290890 or email sales@hodkin-jones.co.uk
