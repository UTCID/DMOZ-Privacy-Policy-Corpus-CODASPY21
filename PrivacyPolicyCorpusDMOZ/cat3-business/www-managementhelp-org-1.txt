We get this type of information only if you choose to provide it. You can also
opt out from, change or delete the information at any time. For example, you

Automatically Collected Non-Personally Identifiable Technical Information
Use of Cookies
In addition to the personal information you supply, we may automatically collect
certain non-personally identifiable technical information. The technologies
we may use to gather this information may include use of “cookies”.
Cookies are very small pieces of information a user's browser stores on the
user's computer. We collect this information to (1) evaluate how visitors, guests,
and customers use the Website and/or the Services; (2) evaluate the performance
of our Website and Services, and (3) also provide you with personalized information
if you opt in for that kind of information. You may modify your browser preferences
to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies.
Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your
choices about cookies. If you modify your browser preferences, certain features
of the Website may not be available to you.
Google Analytics Use of Cookies
The Website uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to improve the
use of the Website. Google Analytics does not collect users' names or personally
identifiable information (information that could be used to personally identify
or contact you); it collects only the IP address from which the user accessed
the Website. Google analyzes the activity from that address to record the user's
time of the visit to the Website, time spent on its pages, the website where
the user was referred from, and the user's type of browser and operating system.
To collect that information, Google places a cookie on the user's computer.
The cookies cannot be used by any organization other than Google. Description
of how Google Analytics collects and processes this information is described
at How Google
uses data when you use our partner's sites or apps. Google’s ability
to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits
to this Website is restricted by the Google
Analytics Terms of Use and the Google
Privacy Policy.
How We Use Your Information
For Improving Our Website and Services
IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand
the geographic distribution of our visitors and customers and manage the performance
of the Website. Cookies are placed onto the hard drive of your computer when
you visit the Website, so we can immediately recognize you when you return to
the Website and deliver content specific to your interests.
We may detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the performance
of the Website and to understand the mix of browsers used by our visitors, guests,
and customers. To learn about how people use our site, we examine various logs
of IP usage information, which show the paths people take through the Website
and how long they spend in certain areas.
When you use the Services, the Services may collect, in very general terms,
your current physical location, your mobile device model number, your mobile
device operating system version, and the time when you observed the images or
other information provided by the Application. We use that information to ensure
the Website and Services conform to the most commonly used devices and operating
systems and the timing of their uses.
For Marketing Purposes Only if You Opt-In
You can register (opt-in) on the Website or when using the Services to receive
promotions and updates, or to be contacted for market research purposes. You
can control your privacy preferences regarding such marketing communications
(see the section below entitled “Your Privacy Preferences”).
From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys
or promotions, and Authenticity may request that you provide some or all of
the above listed personal information in those surveys or promotions. We use
information collected from surveys and promotions to learn about our customers
in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest
to our customers.
Potential Provision to Third-Parties Only If Not Personal Marketing to You
You agree that we are authorized to use, reproduce and generally make such
information available to third parties in the aggregate, provided that your
information shall not include personally identifiable information about you
or be attributable to you.
Authenticity may contract with unaffiliated third parties (e.g. Google) to
provide services such as data hosting, advertising, analytics and other services.
When we do this, we may provide your personally identifiable information to
third parties only to provide those services, and they are explicitly not authorized
to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
You agree that we are authorized to use, reproduce and generally make such information
available to third parties in the aggregate, provided that your information
shall not include personally identifiable information about you or be attributable
to you.

THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY CHILDREN UNDER THE
AGE OF 13.
How to Access, Correct or Delete Your Information
Send Authenticity an email at privacy@authenticityconsulting.com if you want
to access, review, correct or delete your personally identifiable information
collected by Authenticity. To protect your privacy and security, Authenticity
will request certain personally identifiable information to verify your identity
before granting you the right to access, review, make corrections or deletions
to your personally identifiable information.
Disclosure of Information
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as
required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.
It is also possible that Authenticity may sell one or more of its businesses.
If so, then customer information, including your information, may be among the
assets that are transferred. If we decide to so transfer your personal information,
then you will be notified by an email sent to the last known email address in
our files.

services Authenticity is not responsible for the privacy practices of those
other sites or services. This policy only applies to information directly collected
by Authenticity.

at any time, and such amendments will be in effect immediately.
