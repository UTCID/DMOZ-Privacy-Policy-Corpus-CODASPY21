Factory Direct Terms and Conditions
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR DROP SHIP ORDERS AND SPECIAL ORDERS:
(Our normal terms are net 30 days upon credit approval)
INSPECTION AT TIME OF DELIVERY
Porcelain/china products and cabinets must be inspected at time of delivery. If broken, items must not be signed for and delivery should be refused.
If items cannot be inspected at time of delivery, then it is recommended that the customer sign for item "pending inspection" on the bill of lading, and will have 10 days to notify us of any problems. It will be the responsibility of the customer to file any claims with carrier, if the above protocol is not followed.
MAXIMUM 60-DAY ACCOMMODATION WINDOW
There will be a maximum window of 60 days past invoice date
in which a Drop Ship/Special Order return can be considered, subject to vendor return policies. No returns are allowed after 60 days from the date of invoicing.
NOTIFICATION PRIOR TO RETURN
Drop Ship/Special Order returns will not be accepted, unless we are first notified of the reason and the return is approved. Please contact Customer Service at 1-888-820-6511, or contact your Sales Rep. We are not responsible for any product returned without prior authorization and an RGA number.
RESTOCKING FEES
All Drop Ship/Special Order returns are subject to vendor imposed restocking fees (often 25% or higher), plus the cost of freight from and back to the vendor.
CUSTOM PRODUCTS
Any custom products (such as Lasco tubs, bathroom partitions and custom-cut blinds) are not returnable.
