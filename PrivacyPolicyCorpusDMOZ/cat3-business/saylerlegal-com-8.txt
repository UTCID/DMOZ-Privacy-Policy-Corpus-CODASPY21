Our Court Service Division files and records documents daily. Court Services delivers courtesy copies, conducts court research and retrieves documents for clients. Out-of-area jobs are handled thru same-day E-filings and fax filings via our affiliate offices. Conformed face pages are returned to clients on a same-day basis.
Our Process Serving Division serves the defendants and witnesses promptly, and the Proofs of Service are generated daily. Our servers are quick to verify addresses by checking with neighbors and conducting address checks through the U.S. postal service. Status reports are prepared and faxed to you. Private investigators are available upon request.
Our On-site Digital Copying Division prepares your subpoenas for records, including the Notice to Consumer (if applicable), and mailings to opposing counsels. Our expert staff serves the subpoena on the location and returns to copy the records. We closely follow your order and provide periodic status reports. In addition, we can have your x-rays and all other diagnostic films or CD’s reproduced for you.
