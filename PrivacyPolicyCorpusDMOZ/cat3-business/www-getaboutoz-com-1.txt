Payment Terms and Terms of Use
Payment Terms
Please read these terms carefully prior to making a booking. These terms form the basis upon which you may use and conduct business through this or any other website operated by We Love Travel Pty Ltd. The parties to these terms are We Love Travel Pty Ltd ACN 135 646 089 of Shop 1, 191-201 William St Darlinghurst NSW 2010 ("the website operator", "us", "we", and "our"); and an end user, anyone who uses our site ("you" or "the customer"). These terms of use apply to www.camperhire.com.au, www.ecampers.co.nz, www.getaboutoz.com, www.campervanhire.com.au, www.welovetravel.com, www.welovetravel.com.au and any other of our websites (collectively referred to as "CamperHire.com.au", "We Love Travel Pty Ltd" or the "site"). These terms may be changed at any time at the discretion of the website operator. All payments made via this site are non-refundable.
The process explained
The following steps are required to book a vehicle during "the booking process":
Booking: A booking guarantees that the vehicle presented on our website (accessible on the payment pages and within "My Account"), or a similar vehicle with a different make and model but the same number of berths and seats, will be available to a customer at the pickup location. A deposit on the total rental cost is payable to the operators of this website, upon receipt we create the booking. The remainder of the rental fee is payable by the customer to the Rental Supplier upon pickup of the vehicle.
Deposit: The payment required by the operators of this site to book a customer's vehicle. A deposit that is received and retained by We Love Travel Pty Ltd guarantees that the vehicle shown throughout the process, or a similar one but with a different make and model, will be available. The vehicle will be booked in the customer's name. Deposit prices are chosen at the sole discretion of We Love Travel Pty Ltd and are subject to the refund policies outlined in this document.
"On-hold" vehicle: On some occasions, a vehicle is temporarily reserved ("placed on hold") for a customer, typically for 1-3 days. Expiry time and date for on hold vehicles will be communicated via the customer's sales rep or via the "My Account" section of the website.
Quote: The full price for a vehicle booking. The quote is shown on the My Account page. The breakdown includes vehicle rental, deposit, insurance, fees, optional extras and inclusions. CamperHire.com.au does not charge any fees. Where possible a vehicle will be put "on hold" for a customer at the same time as the quote is created. Quotes can be given in the preferred currency of the user.
Payments through "My Account"
The operator of this website will take a deposit once a confirmation is given verbally or in writing, or if a customer selects to "Book" or "Pay Now" from the "My Account" section of the website or selects "Book" or "Pay Now" directly from the car display page. If a customer selects "Book" or "Pay Now" from the "My Account" section of the website then it is assumed that a vehicle is available. While we take every precaution to secure a vehicle, depending on the Rental Supplier, allocation of a vehicle is not always performed in "real time", i.e. not at the exact same time that a payment is made. In the event that the vehicle is consequently not available a refund may be applicable per the below ("Refunds of deposits where the vehicle is not available"). By paying a deposit on a vehicle hire to We Love Travel Pty Ltd you are agreeing to the payment terms set out in this document.
IMPORTANT - FREEDOM CAMPERS, BUDGET CAMPERS, TASMANIA CAMPERS, TUI CAMPERS, MIGHTY CAMPERS, GO CHEAP MOTORHOMES, CRUISIN MOTORHOMES, BRITZ MOTORHOMES AND MAUI MOTORHOMES REQUIRE FULL PAYMENT OF ALL BOOKINGS AT-LEAST 38 DAYS BEFORE COLLECTION. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO THIS CONDITION. THE BALANCE OF YOUR BOOKING PAYABLE TO YOUR SUPPLIER WILL BE CHARGED TO THE CREDIT CARD USED TO PAY YOUR DEPOSIT.
Refunds
Refunds of deposits where the vehicle is not available
Occasionally the delay between a payment and the provision of a vehicle by the Rental Supplier can mean that a vehicle is not available after a deposit has been paid. The delay is never more than one or two business days. In these circumstances, the sales rep will contact the customer and arrange a full refund or an alternative vehicle.
Refunds of deposits if the vehicle is not as you expected
What to do at the depot
When you arrive at the depot we strongly recommend that you take the vehicle offered by the Rental Company. In the event that the vehicle delivered at the depot is materially the same as the one for which you paid a deposit, failure to take the vehicle at the pickup depot will result in:
A cancellation fee from We Love Travel (see below), and
No refund of your deposit
If the vehicle presented at the depot is materially different (i.e. its a completely different vehicle) we recommend that you call our hotline to discuss alternatives.
Refund requests due to miscommunication by your agent/s
Refunds (or part thereof) may be applied by We Love Travel if there is proven to be a material miscommunication by your agent. Our Finance Team will work with your agent and Rental Company to determine if a refund or partial refund is warranted. All refund decisions are final and are at the sole discretion of We Love Travel. Please note that if you do not receive a favourable decision, and instead you wish to pursue the matter through your credit card issuer, a "Credit Card Dispute Fee" will be applied. Please see below for more details.
Your agent makes detailed notes of every phone call that took place and all emails are stored along with detailed site interactions (including your clicks on vehicle profiles, clicks through to the payment page etc). These all ensure a detailed "case history" is available to quickly settle miscommunication issues within 1-2 weeks of your request.
Refund requests caused by vehicle malfunction
Refunds (or part thereof) may be applied by the Rental Company if the vehicle delivered by the Rental Company was not of sufficient quality or if there was other issues that caused inconvenience. Unfortunately this is not uncommon due to the exacting conditions of Australia's roads, geography and weather. As your agent we consider it our responsibility to help you get a satisfactory outcome. While our Finance Team will work with your agent and Rental Company on the matter we cannot guarantee a successful outcome. If a partial refund is paid by the Rental Company, no further refund will be payable by We Love Travel because their partial refund amount includes a refund component for the deposit amount.
Refunds for change of mind or change of plans
In the event that you wish to change your travel plans or change your vehicle there will be no refund or partial refund of your deposit. Changes of this nature should be requested through your agent. If you wish to cancel, Cancellation Fees will be applied (see below).
Refunds of deposits for any other reason
By making a payment for a deposit on a rental vehicle you accept the terms and conditions as stated in this document. Unfortunately due to the cost of processing bookings the website operator will only offer a refund of deposits under the exceptional circumstances outlined above.
Credit Card Dispute Fees
All payments through our websites will appear on your statement as "We Love Travel" or "Camper Hire" depending on the currency you choose to pay with. Requests for refunds or partial refunds on your deposit must be directed to your agent. Requests for refunds should never be directed to your credit card issuer. We Love Travel will take every measure to ensure that attempts to reclaim money through credit card issuers fail. We store the following in your "case history" and provide it to our credit card merchant operators to ensure that refunds of this type are rejected:
Very detailed notes from all phone calls
Instant messenger chats
Email text
A video recording of the online session whereupon you paid the deposit and accepted these Payment Terms
Every link that you have clicked on and the time of that click
Your name, phone number, country you live in and all IP addresses used to access the site
To date we have been successful in 100% of credit card disputes. However there is significant time spent compiling the above information. We Love Travel Pty Ltd will apply a fee of AUD$150 for Australian pickups and NZD$150 for NZ pickups for all chargeback requests as a once off fee. This fee is not waived if the user takes out our "Future Fee Waiver" as outlined above. If a dispute is found to be in your favour because there is evidence of fraudulent purchases on your credit card (note though that your IP address and therefore your location and also your phone number etc is stored, so legitimate cases of fraud have not yet been found) the Credit Card Dispute Fee will be waived.
Cancellations
Cancellations and modifications requests must be directed to your agent. Cancellations within 90 days from pickup are subject to Cancellation Fees as outlined below. These fees will not be applied if you take out our Future Fee Waiver.
Cancellation Fees
When a cancellation is made by your agent, We Love Travel is liable for up to 50% of the full cost of hire if you are cancelling within 90 days of pickup or 100% of total cost if you fail to collect your vehicle. By accepting our Terms and Conditions (rather than the more expensive Terms and Conditions of the rental company that charge the above amounts), we effectively pay those costs on your behalf so that you do not have that future liability. However, if you cancel your rental within 0 to 91 days of pickup the following fees will be applied by We Love Travel Pty Ltd, applicable to bookings made after March 1st 2015. All prices are based on the currency of your quote (AUD for Australian pickups, NZD or NZ pickups):
if cancelled 7 to 21 days from pickup: 25% of total hire. Minimum fee payable is $250.
if cancelled less than 7 days from pickup: 50% of total hire. Minimum fee payable is $250.
if cancelled on the same day of pickup or a no show on day of pickup: 100% of total hire. Minimum fee payable is $400.
(Updated 15/10/2017): Hippie Camper, Cheapa Campa, Apollo Camper, StarRV, Mighty, Britz & Maui Bookings also have the following cancellation fees:
if cancelled 22 to 90 days from pickup: 10% of total hire. Minimum fee payable is $250.
Cancellations processed through the Rental Company are also subject to the above Cancellation Fees. Cancellation Fees will be applied upon notification from the customer or the Rental Company. A failure to pickup your vehicle is considered a no show and is therefore subject to the fee outlined above.
When a customer requests their bookng be cancelled and their booking is subject to the above cancellation fees, applicable charges will be applied immediately.
Waivers & Insurance
There are 3 types of cover available. Your agent will be able to explain them in more detail and the full product detail is below:
Future Fee Waiver: This protects your from cancellation fees that would otherwise be payable to We Love Travel if you cancel within 30 days of pickup. It does not cover your deposit. Cost: 20% of your deposit (minimum AUD/NZD$25).
The Rental Company's "Excess Reduction" Cover: This reduces your excess payable in the event of an accident. Most operators offer more than one alternative, the excess decreases towards $0 for the top level of cover. Your agent can explain any other benefits of the various policies.
Excess Cover from RentalCover.com: In the event that you do not wish to take the supplier's "Excess Reduction" you are able to take out independent excess cover from our partners RentalCover.com. Their policies are underwritten by the largest insurers and are typically 50% cheaper than the rental company's excess reduction, with none of the hidden exclusions like vehicle rollovers, single vehicle accidents, hitting animals etc.
Future Fee Waiver
Our "Future Fee Waiver" means that you can safely cancel your rental at any time with no further cancellation fees payable (see "Cancellation fees" above). Cancellation requests should be with your agent, in the event that you have chosen to pay the Future Fee Waiver the only future fee that may be payable is a credit card dispute fee as outlined below (payable in the event that you attempt to obtain a refund of your deposit from the credit card issuer rather than directly from your agent).
The Future Fee Waiver price is 20% of your deposit amount with a minimum of $25 (AUD/NZD). The Future Fee Waiver price will be shown on the payment page.
This product cannot be used when booking with a ''friends and family credit''.
The Rental Company's Excess Reduction
If you wish to take it, your agent will include the rental company's excess reduction price in your quote. The terms for this type of cover differ greatly for each rental company, as do the benefits and the exclusions. There is usually more than one insurance option available. We encourage you to ask your agent for details of the rental company's cover policy and to read the details as soon as possible after paying We Love Travel. In the event that you wish to change a booking because of the Rental Company's policy, you will need to contact your agent within 24 hours of payment to be eligible for a refund under the terms outlined in "Refunds of deposits for any other reason".
Excess Cover from RentalCover.com
If you do not wish to take the Rental Company's Excess Reduction you should be aware that a significant bond will be payable at pickup. We Love Travel has partnered with RentalCover.com, the largest independent car rental insurance company globally. RentalCover.com offer rental vehicle excess cover (up to AUD/NZD$10,000) and cover motorhomes, campervans and cars with none of the exclusions that are common to the rental company's excess reduction (such as hitting animals, driving at night and single vehicle accidents). This product is non-refundable when purchased via this site
Modifications
To reduce the number of days for your booking, please contact the Rental Company. Note that if the modification decreases the cost of rental, the deposit amount will not be reduced. To increase the number of days or to modify your booking in any other way, please contact your agent.
