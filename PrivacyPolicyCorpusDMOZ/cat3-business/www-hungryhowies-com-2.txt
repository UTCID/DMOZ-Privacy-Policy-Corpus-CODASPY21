Privacy Statement
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE AND MOBILE APP.
General
This policy describes how Hungry Howie's Pizza ("Hungry Howie’s" or “our”) may use information collected from users of Hungry Howie’s website and the Hungry Howie’s mobile app (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”).  Hungry Howie’s reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and shall send electronic notice to you.  The effective date of such change will be marked on any notice to you.  Any changes will be effective after the effective date of the change and will not affect any dispute arising prior to the effective date of the change. “Site” also includes HH Tracker.
Collection of Personal Information
We may collect the following information from users who provide us this information in order to create an account and/or order from Hungry Howie’s or any of its independently owned and operated franchised restaurants or food service providers:  your name, your e-mail address, your phone number, your address, your credit card numbers, and your order history (“Personal Information”). If you elect to establish an online account, we have contracted with a third party to perform these functions for us, so that third party’s privacy policy http://revention.com/hungerrush/privacy-policy and terms of use http://revention.com/hungerrush/terms-of-use also apply. Hungry Howie’s policy is to prohibit the unlawful disclosure of your personal information, but HUNGRY HOWIE’S MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SECURITY OR PRIVACY OF INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY PROVIDE THROUGH THE SITES.
Hungry Howie’s has entered into a joint marketing arrangement with our independently owned and operated franchised restaurants and/or food service providers and any information provided by you may be shared with our independently owned franchised restaurants and/or food service providers.  Hungry Howie’s may contact any individual who has shared personally identifiable information with Hungry Howie’s for sales and marketing purposes, for feedback about Hungry Howie’s and its services, or for any other reason logically related to the operation of Hungry Howie's business and agency.
We may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services, or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
If you are utilizing HH Tracker, and only when HH Tracker is running in the foreground or background of your mobile device, the definition of “Personal Information” shall also include:
Login name (as you enter it)
Store number
Universal unique identifier
Latitude
Longitude

RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
This section of the Privacy Statement applies exclusively to California residents. Please be advised that, pursuant to Section 1798.20 the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018:
(a) A consumer shall have the right, at any time, to direct a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s personal information. This right may be referred to as the right to opt out.
(b) A business that sells consumers’ personal information to third parties shall provide notice to consumers, pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1798.135, that this information may be sold and that consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
(c) A business that has received direction from a consumer not to sell the consumer’s personal information or, in the case of a minor consumer’s personal information has not received consent to sell the minor consumer’s personal information shall be prohibited, pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.135, from selling the consumer’s personal information after its receipt of the consumer’s direction, unless the consumer subsequently provides express authorization for the sale of the consumer’s personal information.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a business shall not sell the personal information of consumers if the business has actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of consumers between 13 and 16 years of age, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, in the case of consumers who are less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of the consumer’s personal information. A business that willfully disregards the consumer’s age shall be deemed to have had actual knowledge of the consumer’s age. This right may be referred to as the “right to opt in.”

the site you last visited prior to visiting a Site or about your activity during your visit to a Site. This information may be used by Hungry Howie’s to administer the technical and operational aspects of a Site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server;
Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Hungry Howie’s may use cookies (a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user) to assist in performing some or all of these activities. You can set your browser to accept all, some or no cookies. If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may be limited in your ability to access some or all aspects of a Site or be required to re-enter information.
Mobile Devices & Device Information
Hungry Howie’s technology may also collect Device Information from you. “Device Information” includes:
the unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device (any of which are referred to herein as a “Device”) used to access a Site or through use of the Hungry Howie’s mobile app. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;

Your hardware model, operating system information, along with versions, software, language preferences, device motion information, and mobile network information.
Personally Identifiable Information
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of this Privacy Policy describe the categories of personally identifiable information (“PI Info”) that Hungry Howie’s collects in the Sites.  Hungry Howie’s may gather PI Info from you when you run the Sites in the foreground (a Site is open and on-screen) or background (a Site is open but not on-screen). Hungry Howie’s may disclose PI Info you provide to third parties if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:  (a) complete the sales transaction, such as providing your payment or delivery information; (b) comply with legal process; (c) enforce the Terms of Use; (d) respond to claims that any information you provide violates the rights of third parties; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Hungry Howie’s, its users and/or the public; or (f) in relation to the sale, assignment, transfer or acquisition of all or substantially all of Hungry Howie’s assets or shares by a third party.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Hungry Howie’s will NOT sell or trade your PI Info with third parties, such as sellers of goods or services.
If you wish to change PI Info that you have provided Hungry Howie’s, please see the “Contact Hungry Howie’s” section below.6.
Tracking
Hungry Howie’s will not recognize Web browser “do not track” signals.  If you would like additional information about online tracking and various opt-out mechanisms, please see http://donottrack.us/
Because Hungry Howie’s links to social media sites, and from time to time may include third-party advertisements, other parties may collect your PI Info about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you visit a Site.
Please note that not all tracking will stop even if you delete cookies.
Analytics and Advertisements
For the purpose of enabling better website design and a better user experience, we employ Google Analytics (a web service by Google, Inc.) to track site traffic and provide aggregate reports of how the public interacts with the Sites. Session cookies are employed by Google Analytics in the form of client-side JavaScript code. In utilizing this analytics service, we maintain our existing standards in regards to the sharing and disclosure of information, security and privacy safeguards for the data, and the data retention policy, each described below. Google Analytics analyzes website usage information automatically upon visits to the Sites. Users who do not wish to have their visit information to our website collected by Google Analytics may opt-out by downloading a browser extension or by disabling cookies in their browser settings. Opting-out of web measurements will still permit users to access the full services of the website with most included information and functionality.  However, the preceding two sentences do not apply to services using our mobile app or the mobile apps of third party providers.  Users who do not wish to have their visit information collected by Google Analytics in such cases should not use our mobile app or the mobile apps of third party providers.
In addition, we use Google AdWords, so we are advertising the Site(s) online through a form of tracking called remarketing, Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on various sites across the Internet, and use cookies to serve you ads based on your past visits to the Sites.  You can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google's Ads Settings https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin . Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
Encryption
Hungry Howie’s uses no encryption (data scrambling) on the Sites. When you are on any website that asks you for confidential information, you should check to see if the information being transmitted is encrypted in order to increase the security of your information.  Keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect security.
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")
We make no active effort to collect personal information from children under the age of 13 and do not wish to receive any such information.
