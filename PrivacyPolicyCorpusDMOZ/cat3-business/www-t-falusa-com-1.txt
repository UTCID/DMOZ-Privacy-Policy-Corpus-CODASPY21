IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.12 Choice of Law, Jurisdiction
These Terms and Conditions of Sale supersede any other agreement between (i) you and (ii) SIS and/or T-fal to the extent necessary to resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity between them.
These Terms and Conditions of Sale will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws.
The parties hereby expressly exclude the application of the Convention on the International Sale of Goods.13 Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver
a. Mandatory Binding Arbitration. The parties to these terms and conditions agree that final and binding arbitration on an individual basis shall be the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of your purchase, our service, the Site or these terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute or claim relating to patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, shall not be resolved in arbitration and, instead, the parties agree that such dispute shall be resolved exclusively in state or federal court in for the State of New York, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under these terms and conditions (despite any other choice of law provision). Arbitration under these terms and conditions shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). For claims of less than or equal to $75,000 (exclusive of attorney’s fees, costs, and alleged punitive damages or penalties), the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at https://www.adr.org.
Any Notice of Arbitration should be mailed to us at the following address:Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC One Oxford Centre 301 Grant Street, 20th Floor Pittsburgh, PA 15219-1410 Att: Wendelynne Newton b. Class Action Waiver. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WITHOUT THE RIGHT FOR ANY DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS. Disputes may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction without a jury and not in arbitration. c. Waiver of Rights, Including to Trial by Jury. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. The rules in arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury, and review of an arbitrator’s decision is very limited. WE BOTH FURTHER AGREE THAT, WHETHER A CLAIM WILL BE RESOLVED IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, THE PARTIES BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL INVOLVING ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES.14 Personal data:
