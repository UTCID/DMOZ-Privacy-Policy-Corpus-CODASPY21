6. Cost of Production Calculator and other Tools. Portions of the Website may contain cost of production calculators and other online tools (collectively, “Tools”) which may assist you in your planning.

The results generated by the Tools do not represent professional advice or an endorsement or recommendation of any particular strategy or system by the Richardson International Group. You acknowledge that the Tools are an analytic tool only and are not intended to replace your own individual research or receipt of independent professional advice or application of your own judgment. As with the rest of the Website, the Tools are provided on an “as is” basis. All information, results and forecasts generated by the Tools are provided without warranties as to performance, fitness, merchantability, and/or any other warranty whatsoever, whether expressed or implied. All direct or indirect risk related to use of the Tools is borne entirely by you. You acknowledge and agree that you assume full responsibility to make your own business decisions, based upon your own assessment of your objectives, risk propensity, risk capital, expertise and experience, whether as a producer or otherwise. Under no circumstances is any member of the Richardson International Group responsible for your production or business results or for performance based upon decisions that you make which may be based in whole or in part upon any information, results or forecasts generated by the Tools.

Some products and services offered for sale by the Richardson International Group may not be available in all jurisdictions where its members carry on business.
8. Pricing Information. The prices displayed on the Website are quoted in Canadian Dollars. Some of the Richardson International Group’s outlets may also have different prices or promotional events at different times. The Richardson International Group cannot confirm the price of a product until your order is accepted by it.
9. Advertisements. Any advertisements on the Website are invitations to you to make offers to purchase product and services and are not offers to sell.
10. DISCLAIMER. THE WEBSITE AND ITS CONTENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE TOOLS) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION, TERM, CONDITION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (AND WHETHER IMPLIED BY LAW, CUSTOM OR OTHERWISE) IN RESPECT OF THE WEBSITE AND/OR ITS CONTENTS.

Our website uses “cookies”, a technology that installs a small amount of information on a user’s computer to permit the website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of our website. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of our website and your ability to access certain features of our website or engage in transactions through our website.
Electronic Messages
Communications with you which use commercial electronic messages, as defined in Canadian Anti-Spam legislation, require your consent. Richardson uses commercial electronic messages to give you notifications about your contracts, pick-ups and deliveries, Richardson programs and products and other communications relating to your business. Richardson may use email, instant messages, fax transmissions, voicemail, text message or any other form of telecommunication to communicate with you using the contact information you have provided.
Certain types of electronic messages (such as text messages) do not by their nature permit Richardson to provide all of the information you are entitled to receive within the body of the message. By providing your electronic address as contact information to Richardson, you agree that you have, and are deemed in each commercial electronic message to receive all of the information contained in this policy, as well as the option to cease receiving electronic messages. You can always contact Richardson by replying to any electronic message you receive from us. At any time, if you wish to cease receiving electronic messages from us, you can also give us that notice by simply replying to the electronic message.
If you would like us to communicate with any other person, whether an employee or a contractor, in connection with the administration of your contracts with Richardson, or for any other reason relating to your business, you confirm to Richardson that you have received such person’s consent for Richardson to use commercial electronic messages to contact them.
The ability to use electronic messaging to contact you is important for Richardson to be able to provide you with information in a timely manner, and to administer your contracts in the way most convenient for you. If you do not allow electronic messages to be sent to you, you may not be receiving information from Richardson in the most timely manner. If you wish to be removed from our electronic message lists, please write to us.
Withholding Consent
Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you can refuse to consent to our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, or you may withdraw your consent to our further collection, use or disclosure of information at any time in the future by giving us reasonable notice. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you or continue to provide you with some products, services or information which may be of value to you. During the term of any agreement you have with us, you may not withdraw your consent to our ongoing collection, use or disclosure of your personal information in connection with such agreement.
Limiting Collection and Sources of Information
We will limit the collection and use of personal information to that which is necessary for the purposes we have identified to you, including without limitation, the purposes identified above, using means which are fair and lawful. Although we will collect your personal information primarily from you, we may also collect it from external sources such from credit bureaus, references, employers, personal property and land titles registries and other government agencies, other creditors and financial institutions.
Safeguarding Information
We protect personal information against loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification with security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. Our safeguards vary depending on the information’s sensitivity, amount, distribution and format of the information and the method of storage. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help safeguard your personal information. For example, personal information which we hold electronically is on password protected computer systems with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Paper-based files are kept in controlled facilities and access is restricted on a need to know basis. All security measures are appropriate to the sensitivity level of your information.
We will permit only authorized employees and contractors, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to your personal information. Employees and contractors who violate our Privacy Policy will be subject to our normal disciplinary process.
We are responsible for all personal information in our control. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance. Although we cannot take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
In some cases, we may refer you to a third party where you provide your personal information directly to the third party. In this instance, your disclosures will be made pursuant to the third party’s privacy policies and we are not responsible in the event of any breach or non-compliance by such third party of their privacy policies or applicable privacy legislation.
Retention Policies
We retain personal information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected. The length of time personal information is retained varies depending on the purpose for which the information was collected. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is legally necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date. When your information is no longer needed for the purposes it has been collected, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form. The length of time we retain your information will be the minimum required by legal and audit purposes, and until the expiration of all relevant limitation periods following completion of all services and obligations requested or required of us.
Keeping Information Accurate
We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their account information (except when prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.
