If at any time you believe that Photovault has not followed the above policy, please email us.
The use of the Photovault.com website constitutes a legal agreement between you and Photovault.com.
It is important to understand this agreement
(the "Agreement") before continuing use of the site.
IMAGE USE LICENSE
Photovault.com, Inc. (“Photovault”) grants you a non-exclusive license to use the Photovault images (“Images”) subject to the following terms and conditions.
Clicking on the “I agree” button and/or downloading any Image signifies that you are over 18 years of age and otherwise competent to enter into this Agreement and accept all of its terms and conditions of use.
Authorized Uses: Royalty Free
You are authorized to use the Images you license as Royalty Free in any manner you deem fit, in as many quantities, and with no time restrictions.
However you may not use the Images alone, or in combination with other material, to create goods or services for which you or others receive consideration, except with unique licensing language specific to your project. In another words, using our Royalty Free images in which the image itself is the main product that is being reproduced in multiple reproduction quantities that then you sell for money, (Greeting Cards, Films, Movies, Books, Stock Photos, Stock Video, etc.) is not allowed. Multiple copies is defined as 1000 or more copies of the product are offered.
Main Product is defined as the use of our images for a product in which our images consist 50% or more of the image content of that given product.
Authorized Uses: Rights Managed
You are authorized to use the Images you license solely for the specific purposes that you state in your “price calculator license fee” request.
If your project requires a quarter page photo, has a print run of 10,000 and is for use in a corporate brochure, then that is what the licensing agreement extends to; there may be no further use (website, fliers, etc.) without additional licensing.
You may not use the Images alone, or in combination with other material, to create goods or services for which you or others receive consideration, except with unique licensing language specific to your project. In another words, using our Royalty Free images in which the image itself is the main product that is being reproduced in multiple reproduction quantities that then you sell for money, (Greeting Cards, Films, Movies, Books, Stock Photos, Stock Video, etc.) is not allowed. Multiple copies is defined as 1000 or more copies of the product are offered.
Main Product is defined as the use of our images for a product in which our images consist 50% or more of the image content of that given product.
In some cases, there are also issues related to copyright, trademark, commercial or editorial use and model releases that need to be addressed.
Following is a more detailed account of this topic:
Photovault owns or controls the copyright to every image on its web site.
That means Photovault can license the use of the image to you, BUT IT MAY NOT MEAN THAT ALL RIGHTS IN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE IMAGE HAVE BEEN CLEARED FOR USE.
If the image contains a PERSON OR A MAN MADE OBJECT, you may have to acquire additional rights from third parties.
Although we urge you to consult your own attorney if you have any questions about the scope of our license, we offer the following brief explanation:
A photograph is a creative work which is itself protected by copyright, but the image may include other people’s trademarks, privacy rights and copyrights.
For example,
if you license a picture of a major league baseball player you would need his permission to use his photo for commercial purposes, and you would also need the permission of Major League Baseball and the team to show any of its trademarks.
It is also possible that the stylized image of an Indian brave on his uniform (not visible) might be copyrighted by the artist who created it.
(Although it is likely that the copyright was assigned to the team).
The point is that even though Photovault owns the copyright in the image itself, without further permission you could license our photo of the major-leaguer for personal use (say to hang on your bedroom wall), but you could not duplicate it and sell it to others or use it to advertise your product.
The following brief discussion is intended to familiarize you with the subject, but it is not legal advice and may not be relied on by you.
If in doubt, consult a lawyer.
RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY AND PRIVACY
A person has the right to control the use of his or her image so that others cannot use it commercially.
Under California law (other states have similar, but not identical, laws) you may not, without authorization, use another person’s name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in any manner on products or for advertising or selling goods or services.
Generally speaking, these rights pertain only to living people, but that is not an absolute rule.
Even if an image is used in a non-commercial context, there are certain other concerns to be aware of.
You may not make private facts public (this is not a concern with Photovault’s images), and you must be sensitive to the context in which an image is used.
Photovault will advise you whether a so-called “model release” has been signed by the subject of a photograph.
However, a model release is not all encompassing.
Photovault will advise you if the model has restricted the release in a particular manner--for example, the image may not be used to advertise tobacco or gambling.
However, there are sensitive subject areas which are usually not restricted in a model release but could still cause trouble whether used commercially or otherwise.
For example,
a model might be happy to have her image used in the context of selling dresses, but would be very unhappy if that same image were used in an anti-abortion poster or on a pornographic web site.
TRADEMARKS
A trademark is used to identify its owner’s goods or services.
The mark may be words or a design or even a color.
The purpose of trademark law is to prevent confusion by the public as to source, origin or approval.
For example, if you buy a “Rolex” watch you have the right to assume that the name guarantees a fine timepiece.
If you buy one from a street vendor for $10, that vendor has likely infringed the Rolex trademark by attempting to use the Rolex name (trademark) to make you believe that you are buying a high quality watch.
For another example,
British Airways probably has a trademark on both its name and the distinctive design of its logo.
Without further permission from them, you could not use this image to suggest that British Airways endorses a commercial jet lag potion.
On the other hand, you could use this image as part of a digital postcard to send to your best friend in order to brag about your recent trip to Europe.
Why?
Because the latter is personal, non-commercial and does not suggest that British Airways endorsed your trip.
COPYRIGHT
Copyright protects creative work which has been fixed in a tangible means of expression.
Books, movies, paintings, and music are just a few of the more obvious works which qualify for protection.
All photographs on the Photovault.com site are copyrighted by Photovault or the photographer who assigned rights to us.
Copyright is limited in scope.
All new works are protected for the life of the artist plus 70 years.
Some older works may have fallen into the public domain because their original term of protection has expired.
Public domain works may be used by anyone.
A photograph of a work of art presents a somewhat complicated issue.
The copyright in the photograph itself is owned by the photographer, but the copyright in the art work photographed belongs to the artist.
For example,
the photograph of this painting is copyrighted by Photovault.
The artist (Claudio Luna) owns the copyright in the painting, but he has assigned joint rights to Photovault.
In fact, the artists of all of the images shown on the site under “Art Paintings” have assigned joint rights to Photovault, so your license will allow you to use them in almost all editorial and commercial contexts.
This example has another twist.
Because the painting is of a recognizable person, you will need to be sure that she has signed a model release before using the image commercially.
Photovault’s “Art Paintings” category is generally safe because the painters have assigned joint us rights.
However, you should be aware of images in other categories that might include a copyrighted work incidentally.
For example, an image of a public building might have a sculpture in the foreground.
If the art work remains only a small part of the image, it is probably not a problem, but if you enlarge the copyrighted sculpture and eliminate the balance of the photo then you might run into trouble.
PROPERTY AND BUILDINGS
One area you don’t have much to worry about is property.
Almost any building that can be seen from a public place may be photographed without infringing any rights.
Any restrictions on use would be as a result of access rights, i.e. has the owner restricted the right of the public to photograph on the premises.
You are probably most familiar with this in certain museums that prohibit photography inside.
The main concern with the outside of buildings would be trademark infringement—that is does the building have signage or such a distinct shape that use of the photograph would imply sponsorship of goods or services.
For example,
you could use this image of the Transamerica building to illustrate a story on architecture, but because the company uses its building as a trademark for its financial services business, you could not use this image to promote your insurance business.
That might confuse the public into thinking Transamerica was affiliated with your business.
COMMERCIAL USE OR EDITORIAL USE
There are two types of licenses when purchasing and image from Photovault.com.
To determine the type of use read below. The pricing is the same for either use; it simply is in the way we license the use of an image.
Commercial use license allows the purchaser to use images on a commercial basis.
This includes but is not limited to advertisement, brochures, flyers, book covers, web site design, magazines, etc. Commercial use license does not prohibit you from using those images for editorial content, and you should assign your images for sale under terms of the commercial use license whenever possible. Please remember that there are some restrictions to the subject of photos that may prevent you from using this license type. For example, photos containing recognizable and uniquely identifiable models or property cannot be sold for commercial use without release forms. Additionally images may be restricted as per discussions above.
Editorial use license loosens the restrictive nature of commercial use, but it also narrows the actual use of our images to editorial articles or similar material that can only be used in the editorial context. Images are considered Editorial Use if they are used for editorial purposes (for example to accompany an article). Editorial use images are usually different from commercial use images in that they can be images of celebrities, politicians, newsworthy events, and many other uses. They may be used in Magazines, Newspapers, Books, Textbooks, and occasionally CD-ROM’s and Web Sites.
License Fee
License of Photovault images is made on a per image basis with multiple pixel dimensions available.
The majority of images will be the exact pixel dimension indicated, either 418 x 282 pixels, 1200 x 800 pixels, 10 megabytes or 55 megabytes.
In certain cases, due to format differences, however, some images will be 282 x 282 pixels or 800 x 800 pixels (ie. a square format) and will be priced in the same pricing category as 418 x 282 pixels or 1200 x 800 pixels, 10 and 55 megabytes respectively.
If you need an image in high resolution and it is not available immediately, we will provide the image in a timely manner and will do everything possible to meet deadlines, but will not be held responsible for any loss or indirect damages related to any delay of image to you.
No refunds or exchanges will be made other than for technical reasons.
