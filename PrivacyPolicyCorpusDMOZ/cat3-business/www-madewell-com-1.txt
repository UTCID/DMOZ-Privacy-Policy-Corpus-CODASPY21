Terms of Use
Terms of Use
Welcome to the Madewell website, madewell.com (the “Madewell Website”), owned and operated by Madewell, Inc. and its affiliates (“Madewell”). Except as otherwise noted herein, these terms and conditions (the “Terms”) govern your use of the Madewell Website and Madewell’s services, applications, content and products (collectively, the “Site”). Please read the following terms and conditions of use, including an Arbitration Agreement, because your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not access or use the Site. Madewell reserves the right to make changes to the Site and to these Terms from time to time. When we make changes, we will post them here. For this reason, we encourage you to review these Terms whenever you use our Site because by visiting the Site, you agree to accept any such changes. Madewell provides you with access to and use of the Site subject to your compliance with the Terms. No material from the Site may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted or distributed in any way, except as specifically permitted on the Site. The Site, including all of its information and content, such as text, data, wallpaper, icons, characters, artwork, images, photographs, graphics, music, sound, messages, software and the HTML used to generate the pages (collectively, “Materials and Content”), is Madewell property or that of our suppliers or licensors and is protected by patent, trademark and/or copyright under United States and/or foreign laws. Except as otherwise provided on the site or in these Terms, you may not use, download, upload, copy, print, display, perform, reproduce, publish, modify, delete, add to, license, post, transmit or distribute any Materials and Content from this Site in whole or in part, for any public or commercial purpose without the specific prior written permission of Madewell. We grant you a personal, limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to access the Site and to use the information and services contained here solely for your personal, noncommercial use as described below. We reserve the right, for any reason or for no reason, in our sole discretion and without notice to you, to revise the products and services described on the Site and to terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Site, including, but not limited to, the Materials and Content on the Site as well as features and/or hours of availability of the Site, and we will not be liable to you or to any third party for doing so. We may also impose rules for and limits on use of the Site or restrict your access to part, or all, of the Site without notice or penalty. We have the right to change these rules and/or limitations at any time, in our sole discretion.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, YOUR VISIT TO THE SITE OR TO ANY PURCHASE, TRANSACTION, RETURN OR OTHER INTERACTION WITH MADEWELL (INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATING TO MADEWELL’S ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL AND MOBILE SMS MESSAGES SENT BY MADEWELL OR MADEWELL’S COLLECTION OR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION) (“DISPUTE”) SHALL BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.
ANY PARTY WHO INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION MUST FIRST TRY IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE BY PROVIDING TO THE OTHER PARTY A WRITTEN NOTICE (“NOTICE”) DESCRIBING THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DISPUTE AND THE SPECIFIC RELIEF SOUGHT, AND INCLUDING ANY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION. THE NOTICE MUST BE MAILED VIA CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL TO: MADEWELL 770 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10003 ATTN: GENERAL COUNSEL, OR TO YOU AT YOUR LAST-USED BILLING ADDRESS OR THE BILLING AND/OR SHIPPING ADDRESS IN YOUR ONLINE PROFILE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE NOTICE IS RECEIVED, EITHER PARTY MAY COMMENCE ARBITRATION.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (‘AAA’), ADR.ORG, 1.800.778.7879, AND PURSUANT TO THE THEN APPLICABLE AAA COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND MEDIATION PROCEDURES. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE THE ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE, BASED ON WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS, IN PERSON IN THE COUNTY WHERE YOU LIVE OR AT ANOTHER MUTUALLY AGREED LOCATION. UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR FINDS SOME OR ALL OF YOUR CLAIMS TO BE FRIVOLOUS, WITHOUT MERIT OR OTHERWISE NON-REIMBURSEABLE, MADEWELL WILL REIMBURSE YOUR REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS FOR CLAIMS TOTALING LESS THAN $10,000 AND AGREES NOT TO SEEK ATTORNEYS’ FEES OR COSTS FROM YOU. (IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN ACTION IS FRIVOLOUS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY CONSIDER WHETHER MADEWELL HAS OFFERED YOU A FULL REFUND OF THE SUM YOU PAID FOR ITEMS YOU PURCHASED FROM MADEWELL, OR HAS OTHERWISE OFFERED FULL RELIEF TO YOU IN RELATION TO YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.) IN LIEU OF ARBITRATION, EITHER YOU OR MADEWELL MAY ASSERT INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT CONSISTENT WITH THE JURISDICTIONAL AND DOLLAR LIMITS THAT MAY APPLY. THIS SECTION WILL SURVIVE AFTER THE TERMS OF USE TERMINATE OR YOUR USE OF THE SITE ENDS.
IF YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE ANY MADEWELL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT (AS DEFINED BELOW), WE MAY BRING SUIT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. YOU CONSENT TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN THESE COURTS.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER
You and Madewell agree that any Dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, collective or representative action. If this class action waiver is found to be void or unenforceable, the Dispute shall be resolved in state or federal court rather than in arbitration. . You further agree that you will not be a member of any putative or actual class in a class action brought by anyone else, nor will you seek to become a class representative. You further agree that in any action you initiate, any relief you seek will be confined to relief on your own behalf. This section will survive after the Terms of Use terminate or your use of the Site ends.
Governing Law
By visiting this Site, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law and the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions, shall govern any proceeding that occurs in arbitration. In the event any claim is found not to be arbitrable, normal choice-of-law rules shall apply to any proceeding brought in state or federal court.

By submitting or posting User Content on the Site, on your social media accounts or through any tools or applications we provide for posting or sharing your User Content with us, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or control any and all rights in and to the User Content, and the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms, and if you are not the holder of such rights, the holder of such rights has completely and effectively waived all such rights and irrevocably granted you the right to grant the licenses stated above without the need for payment to you or any other person or entity; (ii) you have obtained permission from any individuals that appear in the User Content to use, and grant others the right to use, their name, image, voice and/or likeness without the need for payment to you or any other person or entity; (iii) you are 18 years of age or older; and (iv) the User Content does not (a) contain false or misleading information, (b) infringe on the intellectual property, privacy, publicity, statutory, contractual or other rights of any third party, (c) contain any libelous, defamatory, obscene, offensive, threatening or otherwise harassing or hateful content, (d) contain any addresses, email addresses, phone numbers or any contact information or (e) contain computer viruses, worms or other harmful files. Upon request by Madewell, you will furnish Madewell any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms. You are solely responsible for the User Content and you hereby agree to indemnify and hold Madewell and its employees, agents, affiliates, assigns and licensees harmless from any and all damages, claims, expenses, costs or fees arising from or in connection with a breach of any of the foregoing representations or your violation of any laws or rights of a third party.
Madewell does not guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy or reliability of any User Content or endorse any opinions expressed by you or anyone else. By submitting or posting the User Content you fully and unconditionally release and forever discharge Madewell and its officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual or consequential, direct or indirect), whether now known or unknown, of every kind and nature relating to, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) disputes between you and one or more users or any other person or entity, or (ii) the use by Madewell or you of the User Content, including, without limitation, any and all claims that use of the User Content pursuant to these Terms violates any of your intellectual property rights, copyrights, rights of publicity or privacy, “moral rights,” or rights of attribution and integrity. You acknowledge and agree that Madewell has no control over, and shall have no liability for any damages resulting from, the use (including, without limitation, re-publication) or misuse by you or any third party of any User Content. Madewell acts as a passive conduit for User Content and has no obligation to screen or monitor User Content. If Madewell becomes aware of any User Content that allegedly may not conform to these Terms, Madewell may investigate the allegation and determine in its sole discretion whether to take action in accordance with these Terms. Madewell has no liability or responsibility to users for performance or nonperformance of such activities.
MADEWELL HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO REMOVE AND/OR DELETE WITHOUT NOTICE ANY USER CONTENT WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT IT DEEMS OBJECTIONABLE. YOU CONSENT TO SUCH REMOVAL AND/OR DELETION AND WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST MADEWELL FOR SUCH REMOVAL AND/OR DELETION. MADEWELL IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO STORE POSTED CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS YOU TRANSMIT THROUGH THE SITE. YOU SHOULD TAKE MEASURES TO PRESERVE COPIES OF ANY DATA, MATERIAL, CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST ON THE SITE OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS.
COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS
Madewell respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users and visitors to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Madewell‘s copyright agent the following information required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512 (“DMCA”). Please be advised that to be effective, the Notice must include ALL of the following:
a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party;
a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and
a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Notices of claimed copyright infringement and counter-notices should be directed to:
By mail:J.Crew Group, LLC
Attn: General Counsel
770 Broadway
New York, NY 10003
By email:generalcounsel@jcrew.com
(For both mail and email notices, please include “Notice of Infringement” in the subject line.)
Upon receipt of notices complying with the DMCA, Madewell will act to remove or disable access to any material found to be infringing or found to be the subject of infringing activity and will act to remove or disable access to any reference or link to material or activity that is found to be infringing.
It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.
We may give you notice that we have removed or disabled access to certain content or material. If you receive such a notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to the designated agent that includes the information below. To be effective, the counter-notification must be a written communication that includes the following:
your physical or electronic signature;
identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
statement from you under the penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Madewell may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.
IMPORTANT NOTE: THE PRECEDING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR NOTIFYING MADEWELL ABOUT INFRINGEMENTS OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL. ALL OTHER INQUIRIES, SUCH AS PRODUCT- OR SERVICE-RELATED QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS, OR QUESTIONS ON PRIVACY, WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
