Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Our websites are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Energizer does not market any of its products online for children under the age of 13, nor does Energizer design its online applications, advertisements and other features to attract an audience of children under the age of 13. Although certain pages within the website may reference "kids," "children," or "students," Energizer strictly intends for such portions of the website to be used only by adults (such as parents and teachers) or children of the age 13 or older. Energizer adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not knowingly register or otherwise collect personally identifiable information from any child under the age of 13 without the prior verifiable consent of the child's parent or guardian. However, we are allowed to collect personal information from a child for the one-time purpose of responding to an inquiry, answering an email, or seeking Verifiable Parental Consent at the request of the child under the age of 13.
Energizer does not sell or share information obtained from minors with any third parties for their own use. The third parties who may have access are those assisting us with or co-sponsoring our website fulfillment, such as for purposes of filling orders or processing payments. We do not share a child's information with blogs or other sites where the information would be publicly accessible.
If Energizer should inadvertently collect information from a child under the age of 13, we delete that information, except to the extent needed to seek Verifiable Parental Consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian. When Verifiable Parental Consent is obtained, we collect only that personal information from a minor that is relevant to the registration or purchase. We protect the information with security safeguards and confidentiality measures that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the information. Parents or legal guardians have the right to review their child's personal information, delete it, or withdraw permission to allow further collection or use of that information.
