Shipping Options
All products ship FOB: Point of Shipment. Buyer to specify carrier in writing. If Buyer does not specify carrier in writing when order is placed, Seller reserves the right to select a carrier at Seller's discretion and shipment will be invoiced to Buyer. Unless notified otherwise in writing at the time of purchase order placement, all orders with an order value of less than $500 will automatically ship UPS Ground Prepay & Add. Seller is not responsible for the delay of any freight carrier or safe carriage of goods. Risk of loss passes upon delivery of goods to the carrier and Buyer must file any claim for damage in transit with the carrier. Goods are insured by standard carrier coverage only. Shipment of product may dispatch from multiple facilities resulting in separate freight charges.
Shipping E-Commerce
All products ship FOB St. Louis, MO unless otherwise noted. Items ship via a ground service carrier (typically UPS). There are no options to expedite freight delivery or choose an alternative carrier from the online store. Please contact us (800-827-2277) for assistance with expediting requests.We currently ship only within the continental U.S. We are not responsible for the delay of any freight carrier or safe carriage of goods. All goods are shipped at the customer's risk. Goods insured by standard carrier coverage only.
Cancellation Requests
As most orders will ship within 12 to 24 hours of receipt, cancellation requests must be approved by a seller sales representative. This approval must be issued in writing and a $50 fee may apply. In the event of cancellation or deferral of deliveries on an order, buyer assumes immediate liability for any completed part of the order, any material ordered or tooling work performed.
Returns Policy
Returns are only accepted with a Return Authorization Number supplied by an agent of seller and are subject to a $50 per carton restocking charge. Returns will not be accepted more than two months after the order ship date. Purchases from the online store are not returnable unless defective. Please contact us at 1-800-827-2277.
Sales Tax and Tax-Exempt Status
Only customers with a ship to address in Missouri, New Jersey or California are charged sales tax. If buyer's account is tax exempt, the tax code is not changed until seller has an exemption certificate physically in hand.
Samples and Pre-Approval of Samples
Samples are not available through the online store. Please visit our Request for Quote form or contact a sales representative at 1-800-827-2277 to order samples before placing your order. Typically samples are provided at no charge. Seller strongly recommends customer evaluation of sample products prior to order placement.
Insuring the product works for any given application is ultimately the responsibility of the purchaser. If buyer does not request or declines samples for evaluation, request to return any order, unless defective, will be respectfully declined. The selection of diameter, thickness and length are key considerations. Our sales staff will be happy to assist you with your requirements.
Samples are processed daily. If the request is for an item available from our stockroom, it will be sent out, typically,by the next working day. If a custom size is required for sampling purposes it will either be produced in our sample lab (charges may apply), as the schedule allows, or requested from our other facilities. Delivery of samples using either of these latter options is dependent on scheduling and cannot be predetermined.
Lead Time
Stock items typically ship within 24 hours of order being received and released from credit hold (if applicable). Production items are subjected to lead time which is specific to the type of product ordered. Standard lead time for each item requested is included on quotations. Lead time will begin for each item ordered when purchase order has been acknowledged, credit has been established and final sample has been approved. Delivery dates specified are desired and not promised dates. Seller will make all reasonable efforts to adhere to the delivery dates provided by the Buyer.
Lead Time E-Commerce
If the product you request is available and your order was processed before noon on any business day, typically, it will ship the same day. If the item is available and the order is processed after noon on any day, ordinarily, it will ship the next business day. If the product is not available to ship within 2 business days, you will be notified and given the option to cancel your order without charge.
Over-Run/Under-Run
Due to manufacturing processes, Seller reserves the right to ship and bill up to 10% over or below the quantity ordered and order will be considered complete.
Pricing
