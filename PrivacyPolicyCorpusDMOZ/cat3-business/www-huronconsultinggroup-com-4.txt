Fraudulent Job Offers
Have you received an employment offer from an unknown source?
We are aware that a few candidates have received fraudulent job offers allegedly from Huron. Official correspondence from Huron comes from huronconsultinggroup.com. Correspondence from other domains, even ones that look similar, are likely fraudulent. Huron strongly urges candidates not to provide personal identifying information in response to an offer of employment if you are unsure of its authenticity. If you are the victim of phishing or fraudulent job offers, contact your local law enforcement or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center: https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx.
