Copyright and Trademark Ownership
Copyright
ChartHouse invests a lot of time and resources to develop and create products that will enliven your workplace and life. For the product to be effective, we have to work really hard (even weekends) and tap mystical inspirations. When the work is complete, ChartHouse protects the product, and your investment in it, by registering it with the United States and other countries as a copyright. This copyright registration prohibits using the product in any way not expressly authorized by a ChartHouse license (see Product Licenses and Permissions below) and subjects violators to significant criminal and civil sanctions. It therefore is very important that you read all license agreements accompanying ChartHouse products and report to ChartHouse any unauthorized uses.

Trademark
ChartHouse also has registered trademarks and trademarks for various brands. These trademarks help assure users that the product originates from ChartHouse and, therefore, should be consistent with ChartHouse’s brilliant track record. Like copyrights, United States and international law also make it illegal to use ChartHouse’s trademarks or close resemblances to them without ChartHouse’s permission.
The following is a non-exclusive list of ChartHouse’s registered trademarks and trademarks: “FISH!”; “FISH! Sticks”; “FISH! Tales”; “The FISH! Philosophy”; “FISH! For Schools”; the Joy Design (); and the Blax design ().
Uses of ChartHouse’s Intellectual Property
ChartHouse’s copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights (collectively, “Intellectual Property”) are protected by United States and international laws. ChartHouse reserves and retains all rights, interest, title, copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights embodied or contained in the Intellectual Property. You must maintain all copyright and trademark notices.
All uses of ChartHouse’s Intellectual Property are governed by the terms on the relevant product license or this website. Registering on this website, purchasing ChartHouse products, oral statements suggesting approval of other uses, or receiving recognition certificates such as “FISH!ing License,” do not grant users permission to use ChartHouse’s Intellectual Property outside of these written license agreements.
Any use not expressly permitted by the relevant product license or this website is prohibited. To be clear, commercial use and performances, including trainings and seminars, are prohibited. You may also not use a near resemblance or trademark confusing with a ChartHouse trademark. Other prohibited uses include reproducing, publishing, distributing, broadcasting, digitizing, editing, creating derivative works from, loaning, selling, renting, leasing, transferring, or circulating the Works, in whole or in part. Engaging in these activities is dishonest, violates federal and international law, and may subject you to severe civil and criminal penalties.

Other Permissions to Use
Permission to Use
In addition to the uses permitted by the relevant product license, we receive many requests to use ChartHouse’s Intellectual Property in other ways. To help answer these requests, we have devised the following permitted uses and rules.
Internal Training
To better train within their organization and consistent with the Internal Use License Agreement accompanying the relevant product, many users of ChartHouse’s Intellectual Property incorporate ChartHouse’s techniques, materials, and marks into materials or presentations that are personalized to their organization. ChartHouse does not object to this usage provided that the users abide by the following terms:
• All use is non-commercial and internal for materials like presentations and posters, not accessories like shirts or mugs. You are not allowed to sell, publish, distribute, perform, speak from, or engage in any other uses of these materials outside of the employees and staff of your organization.
• You identify the materials as being owned by ChartHouse and state that the materials are used with ChartHouse’s permission (e.g. FISH! for Life Copyright © 2007 ChartHouse Learning Corporation, used with written permission for internal use at XYZ Company only. All rights reserved.)
• The integrity of the Intellectual Property must be preserved:
When you refer to or use language from a copyrighted work, such as the film: FISH! Catch The Energy, Release the Potential©, you include the circle-c to signify that the work is copyrighted.
In the United States, the following trademarks are registered and should be accompanied by the circle-r: FISH!®; the FISH! design (); The FISH! Philosophy®; FISH! Tales®, FISH! Sticks®, ChartHouse Learning®, and the Three Star Design ().
For all other trademarks or usage outside of the United States, the trademarks should be accompanied by the ™ (for instance: “FISH! For Schools™”).
ChartHouse’s trademarks should be used as an adjective, never a noun. (For instance: FISH!® and The FISH! Philosophy® concepts.” “The FISH! Philosophy® system teaches …” “ChartHouse created FISH!® products to instill…”)
Do not mix ChartHouse’s trademarks with non-ChartHouse trademarks. For instance, use ChartHouse’s Joy design () and not non-branded fish.
Trademarks such as FISH!® should not be included in the names of companies not related to ChartHouse, or in conjunction with trademarks, service marks, or products of other organizations. This includes take-offs, such as “FISH!man” or FISH! Safari.
All materials must relatively prominently credit ChartHouse as the owner of the Intellectual Property and must state: “FISH! materials©2007 ChartHouse Learning. FISH!, The FISH! Philosophy, Joy & Blax Designs ® or ™ ChartHouse Learning and used with permission. All rights reserved.
You do not disparage ChartHouse or any of its products.
You do not use ChartHouse’s product(s), product name(s), corporate name, or other copyrighted material in a way that would indicate ChartHouse sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement.
Commercial License
ChartHouse from time to time is interested in expanding the number of FISH! Experience providers to perform its FISH! materials in facilitations or seminars. To ensure that ChartHouse’s concepts and techniques are not distorted and to maintain the integrity of the message, we may first offer a special course designed to teach ChartHouse’s techniques to fee paying clients, private, corporate, or within the education system. Successful graduates of this course may be offered commercial rights to perform ChartHouse’s copyrighted materials.
If you consider yourself a strong candidate with significant training experience, an understanding of the importance of respecting ChartHouse’s Intellectual Property, and outstanding integrity, please consider requesting the Commercial License Application.
