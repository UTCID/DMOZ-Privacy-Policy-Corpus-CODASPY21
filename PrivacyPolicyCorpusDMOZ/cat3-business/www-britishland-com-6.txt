Sustainable Finance Framework
Ensuring that every decision taken by each of us every day is environmentally and socially intelligent, as well as making sound financial sense, is central to creating Places People Prefer.
We have developed our Sustainable Finance Framework to enable us to issue sustainable, green, and/or social finance.
The framework aligns with the 2018 Green Bond Principles, the 2018 Social Bond Principles and the 2018 Sustainability Bond Guidelines, as published by the International Capital Market Association (“ICMA”).
The framework also aligns with the Loan Market Association’s (“LMA”) Green Loan Principles   which build on, and refer to, the Green Bond Principles of the ICMA.
These principles support several of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.
It is our intention to develop the Framework as sustainable finance best practice develops.
We may from time to time issue Green, Social and/or Sustainable bonds in line with the Framework. The Framework may also be used to govern other forms of finance including, but not limited to, Private Placements, Revolving Credit Facilities, Bank Loans and Commercial Paper.
The net proceeds drawn/issued across these debt instruments will be aggregated and compared to the value of the Sustainable Portfolio defined, selected, tracked and reported on in accordance with the Framework.
