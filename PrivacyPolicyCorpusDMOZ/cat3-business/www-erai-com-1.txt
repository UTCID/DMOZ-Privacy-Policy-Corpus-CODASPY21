ERAI Membership / Data Access Legal Disclaimer
The following describes the terms and conditions on which ERAI, Inc. offers you access to our services:
Welcome to the user agreement (the "Agreement") for ERAI. This Agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of our services available at the domain www.erai.com, (the "Site") and through ERAI, Inc's services.
This agreement shall become effective immediately and cannot be amended without 30-day's notice in writing accepted and signed by both the organization and an ERAI Corporate Officer.
Those entitled to ERAI services shall be considered a "Member" for purposes of this agreement. Fundamental to participating in ERAI as a Member is the understanding that a business, in all of its activities, should operate in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the state(s) and/or country(ies) in which it conducts business. Members are encouraged to reach beyond legal compliance by adopting and implementing recognized industry standards including, but not limited to, Quality Control, Counterfeit Detection and Vendor Qualification. If reasonable and conclusive evidence is presented and verified to show cause that a Member company has engaged or is engaging in illegal or unscrupulous business practices, ERAI reserves the right to terminate said membership immediately without reimbursement of any membership dues.
Enrollment in ERAI is available at the sole discretion of ERAI, Inc. upon submission and review of a completed membership application. ERAI reserves the right to restrict, deny and/or terminate an organization's membership and website access without advance notice or refund of membership dues. Additionally, if a company or its principals/employees are named on a government list which restricts, bans or limits trade with that company (US Bureau of Industry and Security, US Department of Commerce, etc.), ERAI membership will be suspended until the company is removed from the list.

Upon acceptance of membership by ERAI, the Member will be entitled to receive a username and password. The ERAI website contains information that is proprietary and confidential to ERAI, Inc. By acceptance and usage of said username and password, you are agreeing that the Member username and password information shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed directly or indirectly to any third party who does not have a valid license to access ERAI, Inc. data. Sharing username, password information and website access with unauthorized third parties is cause for immediate revocation of membership without reimbursement of any membership dues. Members agree to notify ERAI immediately of any unauthorized use of your username or password or any other breach of security regarding the ERAI's services.
You hereby promise that the information you provide ERAI shall not: (a) be false, inaccurate or misleading; (b) be fraudulent or involve the sale of counterfeit or stolen items; (c) infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (d) violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, antidiscrimination or false advertising); (e) be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing; (f) be obscene; (g) contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; or (h) create liability for ERAI or cause ERAI to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers.
Upon acceptance of membership by ERAI, Member may display the ERAI Member logo and/or ERAI Member Smart logo on your website and/or corporate marketing materials as long as your ERAI membership is valid.
