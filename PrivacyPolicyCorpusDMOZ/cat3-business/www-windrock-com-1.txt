EU AND SWISS SAFE HARBOR FOR INTERNAL EMPLOYEE DATA
Apergy recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”) and that Switzerland has a comprehensive data protection law (together, “Data Privacy Laws”). Among other things, the Data Privacy Laws generally require “adequate protection” for the transfer of personally identifiable information about Apergy employees in the EU and Switzerland to Apergy operations in the United States. Apergy accordingly adheres to the requirements of the US/EU and US/Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor”) with respect to certain employee data received in the United States from our affiliated companies in the EU and Switzerland. For more information about Safe Harbor please refer to the US Department of Commerce website at www.export.gov/safeharbor/. Any individual in the EU or Switzerland who cannot resolve his or her issue directly with Apergy can contact the local data protection authority for further information and assistance. Apergy provides its EU and Swiss employees with more detailed information about its data handling practices through internal company policies.
