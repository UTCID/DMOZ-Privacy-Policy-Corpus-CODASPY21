Privacy (Stand-by)
Privacy is lounge seating characterized by its aesthetics, suitable for “open spaces”, offering an area for exchanging information, personal calls, or working in absolute peace and privacy. With Privacy, it is possible to create custom configurations and to provide accessories such as tables to support laptops. The collection includes single armchairs or two-seat sofas and a version with side and back panels that provide an excellent acoustic and visual protection. The structure can be made in solid color or combinations of colors.
