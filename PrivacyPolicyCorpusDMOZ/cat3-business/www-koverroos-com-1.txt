PRIVACY POLICY
Information We Collect
When you place an order with KoverRoos®, we collect and maintain the information you enter as Billing and Shipping information, including your name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, and phone, and credit card numbers to complete your order. We may also maintain your prior purchase history for warranty purposes.
Information Security
KoverRoos® uses encryption technology whenever receiving and transferring your personal information on our site. You can confirm that this security technology is working two ways: for one thing, the 'http://' in your browser window will change to 'https://' -- the 's' means 'secure.' Also, a small padlock icon will appear at the bottom of your browser window. This icon insures that your transaction session is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). And, of course, if you do not feel comfortable ordering online, you can always contact KoverRoos® by phone to place your order.
No Reselling of Data
KoverRoos® does not resell your data to any third parties.
