By using the AJCA-NAJ website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
Collection of Your Personal Information
AJCA-NAJ may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address and other non-financial personally identifiable information. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by AJCA-NAJ. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the AJCA website.
AJCA-NAJ encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from American Jersey Cattle Association and National All-Jersey Inc. so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. AJCA-NAJ is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the AJCA-NAJ website.
Use of Your Personal Information
AJCA-NAJ collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.
AJCA-NAJ may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from AJCA-NAJ and its affiliates. AJCA-NAJ may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new programs and services that may be offered.
AJCA-NAJ does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
AJCA-NAJ may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to AJCA-NAJ, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Use of Cookies
The AJCA-NAJ website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize AJCA-NAJ pages, or register with AJCA-NAJ site or services, a cookie helps American Jersey Cattle Association and National All-Jersey Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the AJCA-NAJ programs and services or websites you visit.
Security of Your Personal Information
AJCA-NAJ secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
