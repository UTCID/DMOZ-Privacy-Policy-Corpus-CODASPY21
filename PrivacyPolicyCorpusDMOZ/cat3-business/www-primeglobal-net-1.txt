We value the trust of the public and those we deal with, and recognize that maintaining this trust requires transparency and accountability in how we treat personal information that is shared with us. This Privacy Policy Statement (“Policy”) has been adopted to guide how we collect, use and disclose the personal information acquired during conducting our business and fulfilling our professional responsibilities.This Policy applies only to the PrimeGlobal web site. Please be aware that the PrimeGlobal web site may contain links to other sites, including sites maintained by PrimeGlobal member firms that are governed by other privacy statements that may differ somewhat and/or contain information as required under local law. We encourage users to review the privacy policy of each web site visited before disclosing any personal information.If you have any questions regarding this Policy, please contact webmaster services using the contact us link below.We adhere to the requirements of the law and our professional standards, and as we conduct our business operations, we frequently gather and use personal information. We seek consent to use this information when it is collected and recognize your expectation that it will be carefully protected. Our privacy practices require that we only use personal information outside of the original purpose for which it is collected after obtaining appropriate consent.Personal information is defined as any information that can be used to distinguish, identify or contact a specific individual, including information about age, income, opinions or beliefs, activities, habits, home location and family. However, business contact and other information about individuals that is available in the public domain, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers published in directories, are not considered personal information. Public information is not subject to privacy legislation and therefore is excluded from this policy and is not subject to the same protections as is the case with personal information. However, we do not disclose personal information about our staff, clients, members, vendors and partners without consent.We follow these policies when collecting, maintaining and using personal information:Collection and use of personal informationWe obtain personal information about you only if you choose to provide it, such as contact information to register for certain services and/or events. In some cases, you may have previously provided your personal information to PrimeGlobal (if, for example, you are a former employee). If you choose to register for PrimeGlobal information through a third party single sign-in service (e.g., LinkedIn, Google, or Twitter), we may collect any information or content needed for the registration that you permit the social media provider to share with us, such as your name and email address. Other information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you establish with your social media provider, so please review the privacy statement or policy of the applicable service. By registering and/or submitting personal information to PrimeGlobal, you are also agreeing to the use of this information in accordance with this Policy. Your personal information is not used for other purposes, unless we obtain your permission, or unless otherwise required or permitted by law or professional standards.
