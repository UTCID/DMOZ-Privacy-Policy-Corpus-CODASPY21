4. Personal information that we share with third parties
In order to provide the services offered on our Sites, we sometimes need to share your personal information with other companies in the Tes group. However, we will continue to be responsible for the usage and security of your personal information when this happens.
Tes' data processors
We may also share your personal information with third party processors or suppliers that we engage to provide services to us and/or support our offering to you (such as our hosting, database and marekting platform providers). These third parties may need to process your personal information on our behalf to provide our services. Where this is the case we take great care to only appoint reliable third parties who can guarantee the security of your personal information and our business information. For example, we assess each third party for their compliance with relevant privacy laws and information security practices to ensure they are able to provide the level of security that we would expect (and is required under law) when processing personal information.  Note that these third parties simply process personal information on behalf of Tes and have no right to use, disclose or transfer your personal information in any other way. Please see below in relation to our policy for transfers of personal information outside the EEA.
Third parties that we share your personal information with
Where you have entered into a relevant contract with us, we will share your personal information with other third parties (who will also be data controllers in respect of the information that we share). For example, some of our Sites and services are hosted by us on behalf of those recruiting schools that have signed-up to process job vacancies and applications via the service (for example https://www.tes.com/recruit/school-portal). This sharing will include information related to job applications including your CV, and where requested your image if you have provided one to us. To the extent you have any concerns about an institution's handling of your personal information you should get in touch with that institution.
Sales and transfers of products and services
In any event that Tes decides to sell or transfer a product or service which we provide to you, or to an organisation whom you work for, we may transfer a subset of your data to them to ensure you can continue to access that product and service uninterrupted. Prior to the transfer of your data we will contact you outlining the details of the third party, the data which we will be sharing and give you reasonable opportunity to opt-out of the sharing. We will always enter into a contract with a third party which protects your rights and freedoms under the relevant privacy laws, including the GDPR.
Other circumstances where use or share your personal information
In certain circumstances, we may be required by law to disclose your personal information for investigative, regulatory or other related purposes to third parties such as government bodies, law enforcement agencies, banks or other financial institutions and data protection regulators.
5. Automated Processing of your personal data, including Profiling
Opting in to be contacted about job opportunities
Where you have opted in to be contacted about jobs, the data you have provided regarding your experience, qualifications and interests will be used alongside your site activity to match you to relevant roles. The purpose of this is to provide a limited, accurate and appropriate set of data to schools for machine led and human led recruitment purposes and help ensure that you are only contacted about roles relevant to you.
Schools contact will be made via Tes with identifiable information, such as your name and contact details, not shared with the school until you have replied to them.
If you would not like to be matched with jobs in this way, please ensure the box found within the career preferences section of your profile is unticked.
6. Data retention, data security and transfers of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)
We take steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will only keep your personal information for as long as we reasonably require and for the activities we have detailed above. This means we will retain personal information for the duration of any contract we have with you, in line with any legal obligation for data retention (such as that for HMRC) or, primarily, until erasure is requested by you.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted via email and/or our website; any transmission is at your own risk.
The personal information that we collect from you will, where possible, be stored and processed within the EEA. In certain circumstances, we may require third parties that are based outside of the EEA to process, host or store your personal information and by submitting your personal information to us, you are acknowledging this transfer, storing or processing. Please note that countries outside the EEA may not have the same standard of data protection legislation as countries within the EEA.
In the event your personal information is transferred, stored or processed outside of the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Legislation.  This means that we will only allow third parties to access your personal information where those third parties (a) are in countries that have been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to personal information; or (b) have agreed to provide all protections to your personal information as set out in the Data Protection Legislation (such as by entering into the European Commission's Model Clauses).
7. Your rights - Accessing, erasing and updating your personal information
Should you have any queries or complaints in relation to how we use your information please contact us via the details set out at section 10 below. You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and to ask us to:
make any changes to ensure that any personal information we hold about you is accurate and up to date;
erase or stop processing any personal information we hold about you where there is no longer a legal ground for us to hold it; or
transfer any information we hold about you to a specified third party.
Should you wish to take any complaints or queries further, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office regarding such issues. Further information about how to make a complaint can be obtained at www.ico.org.uk or by telephoning 0303 123 1113
8. How to unsubscribe from any email alerts that you receive
