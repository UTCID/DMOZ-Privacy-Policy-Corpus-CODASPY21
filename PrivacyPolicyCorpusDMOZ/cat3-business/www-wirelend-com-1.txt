Rates and Terms
We are not able to quote you exact interest rates or annual percentage rates because WireLend is not a lender. We have a large network of lenders standing by to process your application. Because we do not know which one of these lenders may offer you loan, we are not able to state exact rates or terms.
If you receive a monthly installment loan offer the rates and terms will be clearly defined in the loan agreement.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but laws are laws and rules are rules.
Important Disclosures: This website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to lend. The operator of this website is NOT A LENDER, does not make loan or credit decisions, and does not broker loans. The operator of this website is not an agent or representative of any lender. We are a lead generator. This website's aim is to provide lenders with information about prospective consumer borrowers. We are compensated by lenders for this service.
Information about loans: Not all lenders can provide $2,500 personal loans. You may qualify for a $500 loan instead of the maximum. The maximum amount you may borrow from any lender is determined by the lender based on its own policies, which can vary, and on your creditworthiness. The time to receive loan proceeds varies among lenders, and in some circumstances faxing of application materials and other documents may be required. Submitting your information online does not guarantee that you will be approved for a loan.
