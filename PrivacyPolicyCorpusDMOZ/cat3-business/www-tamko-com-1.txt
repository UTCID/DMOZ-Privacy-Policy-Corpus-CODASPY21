California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
TAMKO’s manufacturing facilities are exclusively located in the United States.
These facilities are operated in accordance with all federal, state, and local workplace safety and labor laws.
Moreover, TAMKO maintains and enforces a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which requires compliance with all applicable laws.
Currently, TAMKO does not actively verify product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery; audit suppliers for compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery; require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into our products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the countries in which they are doing business; maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking; or provide company employees and management training on human trafficking and slavery.
TAMKO has internally assessed the risk of human trafficking in its supply chain and determined the nature of its business model, locations of direct suppliers, and nature of materials they supply make it unlikely that human trafficking or slavery is involved.

Disclosing Personal Information
TAMKO does not, and will not, sell Personal Information (including the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16). TAMKO may disclose (and, over the preceding 12-months, has disclosed) the Personal Information described in Categories A, B, C, and D for a business or commercial purpose to the following categories of third parties:
Government agencies and courts, required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
Vendors providing services to TAMKO.
Right to Know About Personal Information Collected or Disclosed
Consumers who reside in the state of California have the right to request that TAMKO disclose certain information to them regarding TAMKO’s collection and use of their Personal Information (hereafter called a “Request to Know”). Requests to Know may also be submitted by the consumer’s “authorized agent,” as that term is defined by the CCPA. Specifically, a consumer or his/her authorized agent may submit a Request to Know:
The categories of Personal Information TAMKO has collected about that consumer within the preceding 12 months.
The categories of sources from which that Personal Information was collected about.
TAMKO’s business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom TAMKO has shared that Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information TAMKO has collected about that consumer within the preceding 12 months.
This information will only be provided after the requestor’s identity has been verified. However, even where the requestor’s identify has been verified, TAMKO will not disclose a consumer’s Social Security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health insurance or medical identification number, an account password, or security questions and answers.
TAMKO is not obligated to provide this information to the same consumer more than twice in any 12-month period.
Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information
Consumers who reside in the state of California have the right to request that TAMKO delete Personal Information collected or maintained by TAMKO (hereafter called a “Request to Delete”). Requests to Delete may also be submitted by the consumer’s “authorized agent,” as that term is defined by the CCPA.
Submitting a Request to Know or Request to Delete
A consumer who resides in California, or his/her authorized agent, may make a Request to Know or Request to Delete the consumer’s personal information by:
Calling 1-800-641-4691;
Submitting an online request at https://www.tamko.com/about/contact-us; or
Emailing info@tamko.com
Within 10 days of receiving a Request to Know or Request to Delete, TAMKO will confirm receipt of the request. TAMKO will endeavor to respond to a consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If TAMKO requires more time to respond, TAMKO will inform the consumer of the reason and extension period (not to exceed an additional 45 days) in writing.
A consumer submitting a Request to Delete must separately confirm the request. After receiving a Request to Delete, TAMKO will send a separate communication with instructions on how to confirm the Request to Delete.
Before processing a Request to Know or Request to Delete from an authorized agent, TAMKO will require:
A notarized copy of the consumer’s written permission authorizing the agent to make the request; and
That the consumer verify his/her identity directly with us, as explained above.
Consumers may submit the information listed above to info@tamko.com. Authorized agents may also submit the notarized copy of written permission to info@tamko.com. If an authorized agent has a valid power of attorney under California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, proof of the power of attorney may be submitted instead.
Verifying a Request to Know or Request to Delete
Verification of the requestor’s identity will be accomplished as follows:
Where the requestor seeks only information regarding the categories of Personal Information TAMKO has collected regarding a specific consumer, TAMKO will verify the requestor’s identity by matching at least two data points provided by the requestor with data points previously provided by the consumer. Depending on the information previously provided by the consumer or collected by TAMKO, these data points may include address, telephone number, business affiliation, and/or email addresses.
Where the requestor seeks specific pieces of Personal Information TAMKO has collected regarding a specific consumer, TAMKO will verify the requestor’s identity by matching at least three data points provided by the requestor with data points previously provided by the consumer, as well as requiring a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. Depending on the information previously provided by the consumer or collected by TAMKO, these data points may include address, telephone number, business affiliation, and/or email addresses.
Where the requestor seeks deletion of Personal Information TAMKO has collected regarding a specific consumer, TAMKO will verify the requestor’s identity by matching at least two data points provided by the requestor with data points previously provided by the consumer. Depending on the information previously provided by the consumer or collected by TAMKO, these data points may include address, telephone number, business affiliation, and/or email addresses.
If necessary to verify a consumer’s identity, TAMKO may ask for additional information that will help do so. TAMKO will only use that additional information for any purpose other than verification process.
Non-Discrimination
The CCPA provides consumers residing in the State of California with the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising their privacy rights under the CCPA. TAMKO will not discriminate against a consumer for exercising rights under the CCPA by:
Denying goods or services.
Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Providing a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggesting that the consumer may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
