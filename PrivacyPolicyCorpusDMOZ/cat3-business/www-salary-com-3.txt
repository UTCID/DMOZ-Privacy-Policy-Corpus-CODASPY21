Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Salary has no obligation to maintain or return any data provided to Salary as part of the Alpha/Beta Services. If Salary is determined to have any liability arising from or related to the Alpha/Beta Services, such liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) will not exceed one hundred dollars ($100). 10.3 Surveys These clauses will apply to Your use of Salary's participant, survey-based products and services. If you purchase access to data at the discounted "participant" rates, you agree to and must provide Salary with acceptable submission of a file containing all of participant's employees, jobs, pay and locations within sixty (60) days of contract execution / renewal. Failing to provide Salary with acceptable submission of data within 60 days will result in You being charged an incremental upgrade fee ("Fee") equal to the difference between the current listed non-participant price and participant price annual price. The Fee is then divided by the remaining months of the initial twelve (12) month contract period and invoiced monthly until acceptable participation submission files are provided, or the full contract term has expired, whichever occurs first.

In addition, If you are a customer purchasing a survey on behalf of a consultant, you must select and pay the consulting price. If You do not, You will be liable and charged for the difference between the non-consultant price and the consulting price.

INDEMNITY 11.1 By Salary Salary will defend, indemnify, and hold Customer (and Customer's officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates) harmless, at Salary's expense (including costs, damages, and reasonable attorney's fees), from and against any third party claim against Customer to the extent that such claim alleges that Salary Data violates a valid copyright, trademark or trade secret, so long as Customer promptly notifies Salary of the claim in writing, cooperates with Salary in the defense, and allows Salary to solely control the defense or settlement of the claim provided that Salary will not (without Customer's prior written consent) accept any related settlement that requires Customer to make an admission or imposes any obligation, restriction, or liability on Customer that is not covered by this indemnification.  Process: If such a claim appears likely, then Salary may modify the Salary Data, procure the necessary rights, or replace it with the functional equivalent. If Salary determines that none of these are reasonably available, then Salary may terminate the applicable order and refund any prepaid and unused fees. Exclusions.
