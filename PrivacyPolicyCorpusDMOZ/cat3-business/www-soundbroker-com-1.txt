Notice:
PRICING POLICY WE DO NOT SET THE PRICES. All listing prices are set by the seller and include our fees. Due to the large number of listings we receive, we do not verify whether or not the asking price is fair market value. It is our belief that the buyer is the best judge of what their needs are and how much they should pay. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the buyer to determine value. Please note our statement on every page of our web site: "Contact us to make a fair counteroffer if a listing is priced too high!!!".
Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of price flexibility on listings under $2,500.00. Any taxes, shipping, and handling are paid for by the buyer. It is our responsibility to protect both the buyer and the seller, and we guarantee that you get what you pay for.
PRIVACY STATEMENT SoundBroker.com keeps your personal information private and secure. In order to most efficiently serve you, fulfillment of all Gold Member orders are taken off-site by telephone, fax, or email. To keep you informed about our latest offers, we may notify you of current promotions, specials, and/or new additions to our site.
Our History SoundBroker started in the summer of 1997 when Jan was hired by Disneyfest Asia to market and sell a huge warehouse full of equipment. All of this equipment was either brand new or slightly used. Working under a deadline of only 5 weeks, he had to move quickly, and he did. At the end of the 5-week period, Jan had sold everything from the storage area.
Having successfully completed this project, he realized that there were many other individuals and organizations that had the same need. This thought led to the birth of Soundbroker.com : A firm dedicated to "Sales Brokering" and liquidation of technical equipment inventories. Jan's next client was JBL Professional, who contracted him to sell their discontinued and B-Stock inventory. And the rest, as they say, is history.
SoundBroker.com is now the world's number one site of its kind and has more sound and lighting equipment listed than any other site in the entire world including eBay.
Welcome to SoundBroker.com's Privacy Statement Page.
For years, our policy statement was one paragraph and not one member's information was ever jeopardized in any way, shape, or form. It read:
