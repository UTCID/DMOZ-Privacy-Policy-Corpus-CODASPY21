The following terms of service (these “Terms of Service” or this “Agreement”) govern the provision by Rollo, LLC d/b/a Rollo. (“Rollo”) to the customer executing this online transaction (“Customer”), of the products and services described in (i) the Order Form submitted in connection with this online transaction (the “Order Form”), (ii) the Service Level Agreement (as in effect from time to time and set forth on Rollo’s website, the “SLA”) governing the Customer’s limited right to recover certain service credits and (iii) Rollo’s technical support descriptions (collectively clauses (i) through (iii), the “Products and Services”). These Terms of Service shall be effective as of the date that Customer executes its online transaction and thereby accepts these Terms of Services (the “Effective Date”). These Terms of Service hereby incorporate by reference the SLA, Rollo’s Acceptable Usage Policy (as in effect from time to time as set forth on Rollo’s website, the “AUP”) and the Order Form each of which is made a part of these Terms of Service and collectively referred to herein as the “Agreement.” Capitalized terms used herein without being defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such capitalized term in the SLA or AUP, as applicable. Customer’s use of Rollo’s website, Rollo Network, and the Products and Services is also subject to Customer’s acceptance and compliance with Rollo’s Privacy Policy which Rollo hereby reserves the right to amend, alter, modify, replace or suspend, from time to time in its sole discretion. Current copies of Rollo’s SLA, AUP and Privacy Policy may be reviewed or printed by Customer at the Legal section of Rollo’s website. CUSTOMER HEREBY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THE SLA, AUP AND PRIVACY POLICY.
By submitting an Order Form online or by using Rollo’s website, Rollo Network (as defined in the SLA), products or services, Customer hereby agrees to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
1. Services and Monthly Commitments. Rollo agrees to provide the Products and Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement beginning on the Effective Date. Rollo may perform additional technical, supplemental, or professional services (other than the Products and Services) for Customer at either Rollo’s published pricing rates or at rates mutually agreed to in writing between Customer and Rollo. Also, Rollo may perform remedial services as provided for in the AUP at the pricing set forth therein and without obtaining Customer’s consent in advance. If a Customer subscribes for any Product and Service for a term other than on a month-to-month basis, then each month of such term Customer shall pay Rollo the greater of (i) the actual fees and expenses payable by Customer for the Products and Services for which Customer has subscribed for such term (based on all actual licensing and usage of such Products and Services on a monthly basis) and (ii) the Minimum Monthly Commitment. For purposes of this Agreement, “Minimum Monthly Commitment” shall be determined each month and shall mean with respect to each Product and Service subscribed for by Customer other than on a month-to-month basis, the greater of (A) the amount specified as the “Minimum Monthly Commitment” in the Order Form associated with the subscription for such Products and Services and (B) the highest aggregate monthly amount paid or payable by Customer with respect to all Products and Services subscribed to for a term other than on a month-to-month basis, during the current term for which Customer subscribed for such Products and Services. If for any month Customer’s aggregate monthly fees and expenses actually paid or payable by Customer for the Products and Services for which Customer has subscribed for such term (based on all actual licensing and usage of such Products and Services on a monthly basis) does not exceed the Minimum Monthly Commitment, then Customer shall pay the Minimum Monthly Commitment in lieu of the charges that would otherwise be due with respect to such Products and Services. All payments made by Customer with respect to such Products and Services shall be credited first towards the Minimum Monthly Commitment.
2. Term and Renewal. Unless Customer agrees to a one-year term or unless otherwise stated in an Order Form or any service description, the initial term (“Initial Term”) of this Agreement shall be month-to-month, commencing on the Effective Date and shall automatically renew (A) in the case of a month-to-month term, the first day of each month for successive one-month periods unless cancelled or terminated earlier pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or (B) in the case of a one-year term, each yearly anniversary of the Effective Date for successive one-year periods unless cancelled or terminated earlier pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement (in each case, a “Renewal Period”). Customer agrees to be bound by the service term selected on the Order Form or via applicable promotional codes. Rollo may cancel or elect not to renew the Products and Services for any reason or no reason at all by delivering to Customer a written notice of non-renewal at least five (5) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Period, as applicable.
3. Customer Cancellation or Non-Renewal. In order to cancel or elect not to renew any Product or Service, Customer must (i) submit an online service cancellation request (a “Cancellation Notice”) by completing the cancellation form provided at least two (2) days prior to expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term and (ii) upon submission of the Cancellation Notice, contact via telephone a Rollo customer service representative to confirm the information set forth on the Cancellation Notice, unless otherwise instructed in writing by Rollo to do so otherwise. Difference Services may have a different cancellation policy. It is responsibility of the customer to properly notify Rollo of their cancellation request, otherwise the service will not be cancelled and customer is liable for the charges.
CUSTOMER AKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO PRODUCT OR SERVICE WILL BE CANCELLED, ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SHALL CONTINUE TO RENEW AND CUSTOMER WILL CONTINUE TO BE BILLED FOR ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNLESS CUSTOMER CONFIRMS VIA TELEPHONE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE CANCELLATION NOTICE AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 3 CLAUSE (ii) ABOVE.
4. Termination. Rollo may immediately terminate this Agreement at any time, and without liability, upon the occurrence of any of the following events (“Rollo Termination”): (i) Customer’s failure to pay any overdue amount within ten days after written notice by Rollo is given to Customer or (ii) Customer’s material breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement (other than such violations set forth in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) below) that is not cured within ten (10) days of Customer’s receipt of written notice from Rollo referencing such breach or violation; (iii) Customer ceasing to do business in the normal course, becoming or being declared insolvent or bankrupt, being the subject of any proceeding relating to liquidation or insolvency which is not dismissed within ninety (90) calendar days, or making an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iv) Customer’s violation of the AUP or the Privacy Policy; or (v) Rollo determines in its sole discretion that Customer continues to host content that may subject Rollo to legal liability (in which case, Rollo may terminate or modify the Products and Services to avoid such liability).

In the event of a Customer Termination, Customer shall pay (1) all outstanding amounts payable through the effective date of such termination and (2) if the Products and Services include software for which Rollo does not then provide general customer support, Customer shall pay to Rollo an amount equal to Rollo’s cost of such software for the entire Initial Term and any applicable Renewal Periods. If Customer terminates this Agreement for any reason other than a Customer Termination, Customer shall pay to Rollo an amount equal to all unpaid Charges through the effective date of such termination and (A) in the case of any Product and Service subscribed for on a month-to-month basis, all Charges for the Products and Services through the remainder of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable and (B) in the case of any Product and Service subscribed for other than on a month-to-month basis, all Charges for the Products and Services through the remainder of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, calculated based upon the then-current Minimum Monthly Commitment payable by Customer upon the date of termination. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT CUSTOMER WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY REFUND OR CREDIT IN THE EVENT THAT ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED ON THE BASIS OF A ONE-YEAR TERM IS TERMINATED, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE ONE-YEAR TERM. CUSTOMER HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO ANY SUCH REFUND OR CREDIT.
Upon termination of this Agreement, Rollo and Customer shall have no obligations to each other, except as provided for in this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer shall (i) pay all Charges and other amounts due and owing to Rollo under these Terms of Service, (ii) immediately remove from Rollo’s premises all property owned by Customer, including, but not limited to, immediately removing all of Customer’s data from Rollo Network (including all servers owned or operated by Rollo), and (iii) return to Rollo all software, access keys, and any other property provided to Customer by Rollo under this Agreement. Any physical property of Customer not removed from Rollo’s premises within forty-five (45) days after such termination shall become the property of Rollo, which may, among other things, dispose of such property without the payment of any compensation to Customer. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive the expiration, cancellation and termination of this Agreement for any reason.
5. Payment. Customer agrees to pay all charges, fees, penalties, early cancellation charges, reconnection fees, service interruption fees, installation fees and other amounts due under this Agreement (collectively “Charges”) in US dollars. Each Customer that is a Nevada resident agrees to pay all taxes applicable to its account.

Server rental charges are incurred immediately at signup and are prorated by 3 days to allow for server provisioning and delivery. Customer also shall pay to Rollo all expenses incurred by Rollo in exercising any of its rights under this Agreement or applicable law with respect to the collection of a payment default, including attorneys’ fees, court costs, and collection agency fees. If Customer fails to pay any past due amount within five (5) days after written notice by Rollo is given to Customer, Rollo may suspend performance under this Agreement and if such past due amounts remain unpaid within five (5) days thereafter, Rollo may terminate this Agreement. Rollo may charge interest on any invoice amounts that are overdue by more than ten (10) days at the lesser of (a) 1.5% per month or (b) the maximum non-usurious rate under applicable law. Customer shall be deemed to have accepted as conclusively accurate any invoice that it has not disputed in a writing delivered to Rollo within sixty (60) days of the invoice date. Customer may withhold the disputed portions of payments that are properly and timely disputed hereunder as long as it timely pays all undisputed charges that are outstanding. The parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such disputed charge. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Rollo for any reason constituting “Rollo Termination” (as defined above) or by Customer for any reason other than “Customer Termination” (as defined above), all Charges under the Agreement, including all remaining monthly or yearly fees due for the remaining portion of the Initial Term and each applicable Renewal Period, shall accelerate and are immediately due and payable. All set-up fees, monthly service fees and usage fees are non-refundable. Customer shall not be entitled to any refunds or credits, pro-rated or otherwise, in the event of early termination of this Agreement by Rollo according to the terms herein.
