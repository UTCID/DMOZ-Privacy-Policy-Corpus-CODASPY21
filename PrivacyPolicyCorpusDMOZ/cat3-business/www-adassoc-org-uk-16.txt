Export case study: Courtyard by Marriott & NFL
/ August 26th 2020
Exports and International Trade
Courtyard by Marriott worked with Ignis, a global customer experience agency to create awareness for their brand in the UK. Partnering with the NFL during its international series in the UK, Ignis worked with both entities to demonstrate their shared vision, passion for the business travel and passion for the game.
The challenge:
Courtyard by Marriott tasked ignis,  to create awareness for their brand in the UK. With a small footprint in UK compared to other international markets, the challenge was to highlight the offering to a UK audience that, in all reality, would not likely experience the brand in the UK market.
The NFL gave us the opportunity to engage with a partner which could not only connect to a passionate section of our consumer base, but also deliver an experience opportunity that could engage and enthuse our audience. NFL is an iconic US brand with huge ambitions to export its inimitable American personality and passion, thus echoing Courtyard’s creative platform ‘Follow Your Passion’.
The idea:
The  campaign centred around the Superbowl London games at Wembley, another iconic brand, where inis could harness the captivating environment of the live event, but their key objective was to generate content which could be shared globally. Partnering with the NFL, ignis worked with both entities to demonstrate their shared vision, passion for business travel and passion for the game. With the NFL bringing four games to London, the campaign centred around a physical activation at the tailgate party, offering fans a chance to win an all-expenses paid trip to Super Bowl LIV in Miami.
The tailgate party at Wembley captured the essence of the Courtyard proposition: Selfie booths enabled fans to digitally paint their faces with the colours of their team and take away a memorable gif polaroid. Live activity was supported with film content featuring NFL influencers and NFL BBC presenters Jason Bell and Osi Umenyiora to add to the credibility of the NFL & Courtyard partnership.
The results:
Overall, the campaign results over indexed against all metrics.
30,685 competition entries
10.1m impressions
11% content engagement rate
Display ad and video pre-roll impressions
7.55 million impressions (Across Sky Sports and NFL.com/uk)
2.3% click through rate across video pre-roll (NFL.com/uk)
