terms-and-conditions
These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims between you and us are resolved (See Section 21, Binding Individual Arbitration; Class Action Waiver below). This includes an obligation to arbitrate certain claims through binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the arbitration when you accept these Terms. Unless you opt out, you will only be permitted to bring claims against us and seek relief on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding, and you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.

20.	Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of North Carolina without regard to conflict of law principles. If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these Terms in whole or in part and/or to your purchase of Products.
21.	Binding Individual Arbitration; Class Action Waiver
YOU AND IMPLUS ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
(a)	Informal Resolution.
If a dispute arises between you and us, you agree to first provide us with notice of your complaint via email to legal@4implus.com so that we may attempt to resolve the dispute informally with you within sixty (60) days from the date your complaint is received.
(b)	Arbitration.
Any claim, dispute, or controversy (regardless of the cause of action or nature of the claim) between you and Implus, its employees, officers, directors, agents and third party service providers in connection with the Online Services, the Products, these Terms, or the interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof (a “Dispute”), will be resolved by binding arbitration conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect in arbitrating any Dispute, as modified by these Terms. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, arbitration is not required for (i) individual actions in small-claims court; (ii) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (iii) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (iv) Implus’s right to seek injunctive relief against you in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (v) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.
You and Implus agree that whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.
The arbitration hearing will be held in Durham, North Carolina. If you are an individual consumer (an "Individual Consumer"), and you are located within the United States, you may alternatively select your state of residence as the place of arbitration, but all other actions remain subject to the venue and choice of law provisions in the Governing Law Section. The arbitrator presiding over a Dispute will be a retired judge or justice of any state or federal court with substantial experience in the subject matter relevant to the matter in dispute and will follow North Carolina law, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules, in adjudicating the dispute.
The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
You agree that the arbitrator presiding over a Dispute will be instructed, whenever practicable, to resolve threshold legal issues by way of motions filed by you and Implus.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, other than class relief. The arbitrator's award will be written, and binding, on Implus and you and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you are an Individual Consumer, Implus will pay all arbitration administrative fees and fees for the arbitrator's services, other than the filing fee required for you to initiate a claim.
If you are an Individual Consumer and the claim you wish to assert against us is for less than $10,000 then, at your election, (i) the arbitration may proceed in-person, by telephone, or by written briefs, or (ii) you may in lieu of arbitration bring your claim in small claims court. If either party files a claim in state or federal court that is required by these Terms to have been brought to arbitration, then the other party will be entitled to such party's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in successfully compelling arbitration.
Both parties reserve the right to seek a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order from a federal or state court located in Durham, North Carolina. However, after such request for relief has been adjudicated by such court, the remainder of the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration as set forth herein.
If a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or Implus must start arbitration of the Dispute within one (1) year from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than one year after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Implus encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.
(c)	Class Action Waiver.
YOU AND IMPLUS AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THAT ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THESE TERMS OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE GAME MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You further agree that will not participate in any class action (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms or in any way in connection with the Products or Online Services. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this Section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration hereunder can proceed on a class-wide basis, then such class action is not subject to arbitration and must be litigated in state or federal court in Durham, North Carolina.
(d)	Your 30-Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt out of and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in these Terms. To exercise this right, you must send written notice of your decision to the following address: 2001 T.W. Alexander Drive, Box 3925, Durham, NC 27709-3925, Attn: Legal Dept. Your notice must include your name, mailing address, and state that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Implus through arbitration. To be effective, this notice must be postmarked or deposited within 30 days of the date on which you first accepted these Terms or purchased a Products unless a longer period is required by applicable law; otherwise you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this Section. You are responsible for ensuring that Implus receives your opt-out notice, so you may wish to send it by a means that provides for a delivery receipt. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Implus will not be bound by them with respect to Disputes with you.
22.	Violation of these Terms and Remedies
Implus may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, block and/or terminate your access to the Site and Online Services if we determine that you have violated these Terms. You agree that any violation, or threatened violation, by you of these Terms may cause irreparable harm to Implus, and therefore you agree that Implus shall be entitled to injunctive or equitable relief.
23.	General Provisions
If, for any reason, a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitration proceeding determines any provision of these Terms or any portion thereof to be unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give the intended effect thereof, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect. Implus’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent or similar breaches. No consent or waiver by Implus hereof will be deemed effective unless in writing. Implus shall not be liable for any delays or failure in performance of any part of the Online Services or delivery of the Products, from any cause beyond Implus’s reasonable control. Such causes include, but are not limited to, acts of God, changes in law, embargoes, war, terrorist acts, riots, fires, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, power blackouts, unusually severe weather conditions, and acts of hackers or third-party service providers.
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Implus and you with respect to your use of the Site and the Online Services and supersede all previous written or oral agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.
