Privacy Policy
Privacy:
Model Builders Supply recognizes the importance of privacy and security
with respect to the information you provide when you are establishing or
managing your personal account and when using our shopping cart. We
value your trust and your confidence in our services. This notice
describes our privacy policy. By visiting the Model Builders Supply
Online Store, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy
Notice.
What Personal Information About Customers Does Model Builders Supply Gather?
The information we receive from customers who visit our website helps us
to personalize and to continually improve your shopping experience at
the Model Builders Supply Online Store. Here are the types of
information we gather:
Information You Give Us: We receive and store the information you
enter on our website or that you provide to us in any other way (e.g.,
e-mail correspondence). You can choose not to provide certain
information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of
our website features. We use the information that you provide for such
purposes as responding to your requests, fulfilling orders, customizing
future shopping for you, improving our store features, and for
communicating with you.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of
information whenever you interact with our website. For example, like
many websites, we sometimes use "cookies," and we obtain certain types
of information when your Web browser accesses our website that enable
your own unique Account features, services and privileges.
E-mail Communications: To improve service, and your overall
shopping experience, we may send you newsletters with information about
our services and products, notifications of changes to our policies, and
- of course - order confirmations. If you do not want to receive e-mail
from us, other than order notifications and purchase receipts, please
adjust your "Subscription" preferences accordingly by logging into your
personal account.
What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifier text files that we transfer to your
computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to
recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items
in your Shopping Cart between visits.
Does Model Builders Supply Share the Information It Receives?
We respect your privacy, extending every effort to protect your
e-shopping security, and we appreciate your business. At no time do we
ever provide your account contact or payment information to any third
party vendor, associate or service provider, unless required in the
normal course of action with banking institutions and shipping carriers
in the completion of your transaction and the subsequent order
fulfilment.
Which Information Can I Access?
The Model Builders Supply Online Store gives you access to a broad range
of information about your account and your interactions with us for the
purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
