where this is necessary for the performance of a contract with you for the provision of our Services or to take steps at your request prior to entering into such contract.
to comply with our legal obligations, for example to keep records and accounts, or to carry out identity checks and other verifications prescribed by law.
as this is necessary in pursuit of our legitimate interests in running, developing and growing our business and providing our Services, including sending you communications related to our Services and profiling related to how you have used and interacted with our Services. While there are some risks with this type of activity, on balance, we consider the risk to your rights of data protection is outweighed by the significant benefits in providing you with the Services you ask us for where there is no relevant contract to cover the provision of these Services, as well as in improving our Services and our communications to you. We’ve also implemented protections for your rights by putting in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal data, as set out in our Security section below. You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on legitimate interests. More information on this right and on how to exercise it is set out below.
What happens if you do not provide us with the information we request or ask that we stop processing your information?
Where we need to collect personal data in order to enter into or perform a contract and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to enter into or perform that contract, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
When you use our Services, for instance our mobile applications, tools and devices, you may be asked to provide certain information. Where you do not do so, and that Service, or certain features of the Service, requires this information, the Service or certain features of the Service will no longer function.
Do we make automated decisions concerning you?
No, we do not carry out automated decision making or automated profiling that will have legal or other similarly significant effects on you.
Do we use Cookies to collect personal data on you?
Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as web beacons) are used to enhance your experience by allowing us to tailor our content based on your interests and distinguish you from other users of our Services.
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your device. A cookie can contain information, such as a user ID or preferences, which we use to personalize content, track the pages you've visited or to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our website or use our Services.
We use the following types of cookies:
Strictly Necessary Cookies. These are cookies or other tracking mechanisms necessary to make our Services function as intended. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to use a shopping cart.

Functionality Cookies. These cookies enable us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). They may also be used to recognize you when you return to our Services.
Third-Party and Marketing Cookies: We may allow third parties to place cookies on your device for advertising and analytics purposes. For more information about these cookies, please see above.
Where required by law, we will ask you for your consent to our use of cookies when you first visit our Services.

Certain other functions and/or services might be unavailable to you if you reject cookies altogether (such as remembering your choice of language on a website).
What about marketing?
We would like to be able to contact you from time to time about our new similar products and services and promotional offers, where we have your permission or are otherwise permitted by applicable law to do so.
We would like to provide you with choices regarding certain uses of personal data, particularly around marketing to you, and have therefore established an online privacy center where you can view and make certain decisions about your personal data use. You can find this here. Alternatively, you can unsubscribe or opt out from any further promotional communications from us at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in any of our communication or by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Notice.
Where do we store your personal data? Do we transfer your personal data outside the EEA?
Your personal data will be stored on our secure servers at our offices and those of our service providers, which are located in the EEA or in the U.S. and other countries which may not have a level of data protection law equivalent to that of your country.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it as if it were staying in the EEA by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries or recipients operating under frameworks (such as the Privacy Shield in the U.S.) that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
We may also use specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific safeguards used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
How do we keep your personal data secure?
We ensure the security of your personal data by putting in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect it from accidental loss, theft, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access or disclosure, and unlawful or accidental destruction.
We also take steps to ensure all our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers employ adequate levels of security.
What rights do you have in relation to the personal data we hold on you?
By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data, and we have summarised these below. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country.
Rights
What does this mean?

You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Privacy Notice.
2. The right of access
You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing it), and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Notice).
This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
3. The right to rectification
You are entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
4. The right to erasure

5. The right to restrict processing
You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.

6. The right to data portability
You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.

9. The right to withdraw consent

This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.
How can you make a request to exercise your rights?
To exercise any of the rights above, or to ask a question, contact us using the details set out at the end of this Privacy Notice.

We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:
baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or
further copies of the same information.
Alternatively, the law may allow us to refuse to act on the request.
