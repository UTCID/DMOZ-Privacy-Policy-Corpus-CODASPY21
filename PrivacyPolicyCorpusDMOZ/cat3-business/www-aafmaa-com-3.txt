Terms and Conditions of Use
Last Updated: [January 1, 2016]
This website www.aafmaa.com is owned and operated by AMERICAN ARMED FORCES MUTUAL AID ASSOCIATION (hereafter referred to as "AAFMAA," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms and Conditions of Use and all other legal documents incorporated by reference (collectively, the “Terms”) set forth the legal contract between each end user ("User" or "you" or “your”) and us with respect to access to and use of our products and services through our mobile application and website (collectively, the “Site”).
Some of our other sites, applications, products, services and tools may have additional terms that we provide to you when you use those sites, applications, products, services or tools.
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE AND ANY LINKED INFORMATION (SUCH AS OUR PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.
By using this Site and Services, you acknowledge and represent that you (i) have read these Terms and the Privacy Policy; (ii) understand them; (iii) accept and assent to be bound by them; (iv) are at least 18 years of age or able to form legally binding contracts; and (v) agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations applicable to you, to the use of the Services, the Site and/or the Internet. If you do not agree to these Terms, please immediately discontinue using the Site and Services.
1. AAFMAA Services and Membership.
For so long as you agree to these Terms and abide by them, you may use the Site and Services. These Terms apply to all Users of the Site and Services, including Visitors and Members. Users include both unregistered visitors of the Site (each a “Visitor”) and registered members (each a “Member”). Visitors may browse the Site in accordance with these terms, but will not have full access to the Site or Services unless a Visitor becomes a Member. Not all Visitors are eligible to become Members. Eligibility for membership shall be determined by AAFMAA in its sole discretion. The terms “Member” and “membership” generally refer to current AAFMAA customers who receive certain Services and do not convey any legal, eligibility or ownership rights.
"Services" means any and all products, services, applications, and functionalities as may be provided by AAFMAA to you via the Site from time to time. Not all of the Services are available in all states or to all Users. You may not be eligible for all Services. AAFMAA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine who is eligible for each Service.
Members may set up an account directly with AAFMAA. To access the Member-only portion of the Site, you are required to enter a username or customer number (also referred to as a member number) and password. A customer number is provided to Members on their Membership Card, which is received by Members after an initial product or services is purchased. You are required to maintain an email address in order to access the Member Center.
You may not transfer to or share your account with other persons or entities, and you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your account and all activities that occur under or in connection with it. You agree (i) to be responsible for any act or omission of any users accessing the Site or Services under your account that, if undertaken by you, would be deemed a violation of these Terms, and (ii) that such act or omission shall be deemed a violation of these Terms by you.
Please notify us immediately if you become aware that your account is being used without authorization. You agree not to register for an account on behalf of an individual other than yourself, or if you register for an account on behalf of any other person, you agree that you are authorized to do so and can bind such person to these Terms.
