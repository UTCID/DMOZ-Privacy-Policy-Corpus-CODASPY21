Terms
GENERAL SALES CONDITIONS.
1. GENERALITIES.
When the
buyer or customer places an order it is assumed
that he expressly accepts our terms and conditions as they are
stipulated below.
The buyer
shall explicitly waive the general conditions or special conditions that could
occur on the letterhead of which he makes use.
2. QUANTITIES.
The
manufacturing of certain pieces sometimes requires a minimum number of pieces.
The specified amount is approximately specified. We reserve the right to
deliver 10% more or less, at the price of the order.
3. PRICES.
Save as
otherwise provided our prices are without obligation and may be changed without
notice, even in case of confirmed orders.
They apply
ex works, packing not included.
4. TOOLS.
All the
tools, devices, or components needed in the production, even if the customer
due to intervention in the concept or by taking on part of the cost has become
its co-owner, will remain unconditionally in our possession and may only be
used by us, because they were manufactured and construed according to our own
principles, methods and manufacturing standards. Each tool, device or component
that has not been used for five years or is worn, may be destroyed by us. The
broken down part remains our property.
The
contribution (monetary value) in the tool costs is always immediately payable
(net) when submitting the order. Any delay on this payment affects the delivery
term.
5. DELIVERY TIMES.
Strikes,
fires, damages to material, difficulties in the development of manufacturing,
delays in the deliveries of raw materials as well as any reason that could shut
down production (as well as the recognised cases of force majeure) allow us to
change our delivery times, to postpone the execution of the order or to destroy
the order, without it affecting our responsibility. The delivery times are only
approximate.
Any delay
in delivery may in no case result in the refusal of goods, destroying the
order, damages compensation without prior consent and agreement.
Unless
otherwise stipulated, the ordered pieces should at the latest eight days after
sending our message that they are available, be picked up. Failing that, we
shall be entitled without notice and at our discretion, either to invoice the
fabricated pieces and claim payment, or to consider the purchase agreement
automatically dissolved and to claim damages. Warehousing costs are also
charged.?
6. COMPLAINTS.
In order to
be accepted as admissible, complaints have to reach us at the latest 8 days
after receipt of the goods.
The
complaint will always state the number and date of our delivery note or
invoice.
The
guarantee is always and exclusively limited merely to replacement of the
rejected goods, to the exclusion of whatever compensation.
Our
guarantee liability expires completely when any defect is the direct or
indirect result of improper processing, use, treatment, storage, transport or
any other external cause or when the buyer does perform changes or treatments or
let them be done by third parties.
The
warranty liability will also expire completely when the buyer has not
accurately fulfilled the agreed payment commitments.
Complaints
concerning transferred goods may not affect the contractual obligations resting
on the buyer under earlier transferred goods and/or goods to be transferred,
neither if these obligations result from the same agreement as those to which
the complaints refer.
7. RETURNS.
Are only
allowed after our prior consent. The goods must be delivered back to us free of
charge.
8. TRANSPORT.
The goods
always travel at the expense and at the risk of the addressee, even when they
are sent free of charge.
The
inscriptions on bills of lading, proofs of receipt and shipping notes are
probative of the dispatched quantities. The client must therefore carefully
check them upon receipt.
9. PAYMENTS.
All our
invoices are payable 30 days from the end of month, net without discount,
unless otherwise provided by us. For any amount not paid on the due date interest
is payable with full right and without reminder, from the due date, at 12% per
year.
Each
non-payment on the due date shall also make all other amounts due payable
immediately regardless of the agreed term.
The
compensation between the amounts which are owed to us and which we would have
to pay, will in each case be able to be claimed by us.
We reserve
the right to ask for guarantees, financial or other, which we would consider
appropriate, even during the execution of an order.
In
addition, the amounts due as such, if not paid on the due date, will be
increased with a fixed and none reducible fee that is contractually fixed at
15%.
10. LEGAL JURISDICTION.
Any dispute that may result from interpretation or execution of the order will only and exclusively fall under the jurisdiction of the courts of Brussels or the Peace Court of the 1st canton of Brussels.
