Additional useful information regarding SuperTickets is available on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of SuperTicket.com (the "SuperTicket Site") and the Support page. By purchasing a SuperTicket, you are deemed to have consented to the Terms of Use (of which these SuperTicket Terms form a part). In addition, by downloading or streaming your Digital Product you are agreeing to the Digital Download Terms of Use.
SuperTicket combines the purchase of a movie admission ticket and the pre-purchase of the download to own copy of the Digital Product, as defined in the Cineplex Store Terms of Sale, for the same film. You can purchase your SuperTicket at home or on your mobile device by using our online ticket purchasing service or at any Cineplex theatre at the box office or automatic ticketing kiosks. The cost of each SuperTicket depends on the film title and the type of admission ticket purchased. SuperTicket is offered on select film titles. We may terminate, suspend or modify any SuperTicket offer without notice. Cineplex is not responsible for and will not replace voucher codes that are lost, stolen or used without permission.
SuperTicket purchasers will receive their movie admission ticket and a second voucher for the pre-purchase of the Digital Product. To obtain a copy of the Digital Product, you must redeem the code printed on your voucher (the “Voucher Code”) online at the SuperTicket Site. Once the SuperTicket is purchased, you can immediately redeem the Voucher Code. Purchasers will receive an email confirmation at the time the Voucher Code is redeemed and a subsequent email once the Digital Product is available. The Digital Product will be available to you on or before the date on which it is commercially available by the film’s studio or distributor. Cineplex makes no representations or warranties regarding the date on which a Digital Product will be available. If we are unable to complete your order due to the unavailability or discontinuance of the Digital Product, we may provide you with a credit for the Cineplex Store for the value of the Digital Product portion of the SuperTicket purchased.
Upgrading your Admission ticket to a SuperTicket: Consumers may upgrade their admission ticket to a SuperTicket provided that the admission ticket type and the film title qualify for a SuperTicket offer. To upgrade your admission ticket, you must enter the admission ticket transaction number on the SuperTicket Site within forty-eight (48) hours after the start of the showtime on the admission ticket. If you are eligible to upgrade your admission ticket, you will be redirected to the checkout point to pay for the upgrade.
Refunds: We will refund the full purchase price of the SuperTicket prior to the showtime on the admission ticket. After the showtime, Cineplex will refund the portion of the SuperTicket applicable to the price of the Digital Product provided that a refund is requested within forty-eight (48) hours after the showtime on the admission ticket.
