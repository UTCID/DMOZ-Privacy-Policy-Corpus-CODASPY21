All third-party service providers are obligated to maintain the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data, and to only process your Personal Data in accordance with our instructions and Privacy Policy.

Lastly, DIESEL may share your information with third-parties, unrelated to the services provided on the Site, when we believe it is necessary or appropriate: (a) as required or necessary in order to comply with applicable law (including laws outside your country of residence); (b) to protect itself against liability; (c) to respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, or legitimate requests by law enforcement officials; (d) to purchasers in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a part of our business or company; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property; (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages we may sustain.
VI. Refusal to Disclose Personal Data
Providing Personal Data to DIESEL or our third-party service providers is always optional. However, some of your Personal Data, particularly your personal details, email address, postal address, credit/debit card numbers and telephone number, are necessary for pursuing the commercial purposes of the Site. Your refusal to provide DIESEL with the Personal Data needed for performing the above purposes could prevent DIESEL from processing your order of products on the Site or from fulfilling obligations required by law and other regulations. Personal Data other than that required for processing orders or fulfilling legal or contractual obligations is optional and will not have any affect on the purchase of products on the Site.
We will periodically inform you whether disclosing your Personal Data to DIESEL or its third-party service providers is necessary as indicated by the (*) symbol or optional, as well as any consequences for not disclosing such data.
VII. Security
We have adopted commercially reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access and we encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our Site using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure or error free. If you have any reason to believe that your interactions with the Site are no longer secure, please notify us immediately at the address provided below.
VIII. How Users Can Access or Change Their Personal Data
If you wish to update your Personal Data to ensure it is correct, up-to-date and complete or exercise any right of access, rectification, deletion, or opposition to the processing of your Personal Data that you may have under applicable law, please contact us at clientservice@diesel.com.
In order to protect your privacy and security, we will verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your Personal Data. Any request to access your Personal Data will be answered within a reasonable timeframe and in no event shall it exceed 30 days.
