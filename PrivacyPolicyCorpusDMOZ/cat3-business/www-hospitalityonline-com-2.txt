Hospitality Online may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. Hospitality Online may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, or provide customer support.

Use of Cookies
The Hospitality Online website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your computer by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Hospitality Online pages, or register with Hospitality Online site or services, a cookie helps Hospitality Online to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as your preferences, your resume, and so on. When you return to the same Hospitality Online website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Hospitality Online features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Hospitality Online services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Hospitality Online secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
