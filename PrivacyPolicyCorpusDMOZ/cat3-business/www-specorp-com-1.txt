News & Events
Incorporated in 1971, Houston, Texas based Spectrum has consistently been an innovative leader offering a “total solution” that maximizes performance and increases efficiency in companies worldwide, including many Fortune 500 companies.
Spectrum Corporation is a leader in Unified Contact Center Reporting (UCCR). UCCR is a process of extracting real time and historical data from contact center applications, transforming that raw data into information and publishing that information in useable reports for all levels of the contact center. The reports are seen on dashboards, LCD screens, desktops, wallboards, web based reports, email and smartphones.
Spectrum’s strength in the UCCR process lies in the ability to extract and collect the raw data using one of six different methods. This unique strength is what puts Spectrum ahead of others in the contact center reporting arena.
