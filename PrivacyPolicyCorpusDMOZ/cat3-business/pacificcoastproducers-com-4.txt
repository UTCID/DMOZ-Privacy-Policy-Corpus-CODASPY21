WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR AMEND THESE TERMS FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF OUR SITES OR ANY AFFILIATE SITES FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES TO THESE TERMS WILL MEAN YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.

Assistance. If you have any questions or comments, we invite you to contact us at sales@pcoastp.com.

The use of PCP trademarks on any other Sites is not allowed. PCP prohibits the use of PCP trademarks as a “hot” link on or to any other Sites unless PCP approves the establishment of such a link in writing in advance. The Sites, its Content and all related rights shall remain the exclusive property of PCP or its licensors unless otherwise expressly agreed. You will not remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from material found on the Sites.
Unsolicited Submissions Policy. PCP is pleased to hear from its loyal users and welcomes your comments regarding PCP. Except where PCP specifically requests comments or submissions, PCP does not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested. This policy is designed to avoid misunderstandings if projects developed by the PCP team seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, PCP requests that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials except where specifically requested or solicited. If you do send us any unsolicited suggestions, you agree not to assert any ownership right of any kind against PCP (including, but not limited to copyright, trademark, unfair competition, moral rights, or implied contract), you hereby grant PCP a nonexclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to use the unsolicited submission in every media and for every purpose now known or hereinafter discovered and you waive the right to receive any financial or other consideration in connection with such unsolicited submission including, but not limited to, credit. You release PCP (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your unsolicited submissions, including, without limitation, all claims for theft of ideas or copyright infringement.
User Content. PCP encourages members of the public to submit user published content or user content (e.g., postings comments to articles) to PCP for consideration in connection with the Site (“User Content”). User Content remains the intellectual property of the individual user. By posting content on our Site, you expressly grant PCP a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up worldwide, fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform and display such content and your name, voice, and likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form throughout the world in any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter discovered, including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising, publicity and any other ancillary uses thereof, and including the unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in perpetuity throughout the universe. All User Content is deemed non-confidential and PCP shall be under no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information, in whatever form, contained in any User Content. To submit a request to have content that you have posted removed, contact us at sales@pcoastp.com.
User Content does not represent the views of PCP or any individual associated with PCP, and we do not control the User Content. In no event shall you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, PCP’s endorsement of User Content. PCP does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any User Content on our Sites, and does not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reading User Content on our Sites. Through your use of the Sites, you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate or deceptive. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense. By using our Sites, you assume all associated risks.
Inappropriate User Submissions. PCP does not encourage and strongly discourages any User Content that results from any activity that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any loss or damage to any person or property; or (iii) may constitute a crime or create civil liability. You agree that you have not and will not engage in any of the foregoing activities in connection with producing your submission. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that in conjunction with your submission, you will not inflict emotional distress on other people, will not humiliate other people (publicly or otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people, will not enter onto private property without permission, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, or liability of any kind. PCP may reject or remove any submissions that PCP believes, in its sole discretion, include any inappropriate or prohibited material.
DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (“DMCA”) NOTICE. Third party materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed or otherwise made available using the Sites. PCP has adopted a policy that provides for the removal of any content or the suspension of any user that is found to have repeatedly infringed on the copyright of a third party.

If you receive such an infringement notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing. Please be advised that if you submit a counter-notification, that notice along with your identifying information included in the notice will be provided to the party that submitted the original claim of infringement.
Advertising Rights. PCP reserves the right to sell and display any advertising, attribution, links, promotional and distribution rights, and PCP and its licensors or affiliates will be entitled to retain any and all revenue generated from any sales of such advertising, attribution, links, or promotional or distribution rights.
