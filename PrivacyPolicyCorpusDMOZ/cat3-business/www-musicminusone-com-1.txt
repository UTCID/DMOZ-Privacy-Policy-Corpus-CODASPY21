Music Minus One was founded in 1950 and their sing-along and play-along records quickly became an industry standard. For the first time, even hobbyist players could solo with a professional orchestra thanks to the high-quality recordings that accompanied each book. Over the years the library has grown to nearly 900 titles. The Music Minus One recordings feature world-class musicians and orchestras from the United States, Vienna, and elsewhere in Europe. Most recordings allow the player to listen to the full recording featuring a soloist, then pan the recording to remove the soloist so they could step in and play the lead.
