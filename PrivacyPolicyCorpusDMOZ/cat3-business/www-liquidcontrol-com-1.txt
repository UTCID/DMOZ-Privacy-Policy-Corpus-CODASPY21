Liquid Silicone Rubber (LSR)
LSR Metering Systems
LSR Metering Systems
Graco Fluid Automation offers a complete line of metering systems for industrial applications involving two-component Liquid Silicone Rubber (LSR) materials. Engineered to the highest standards, Graco advanced dispensing technologies deliver accurate, on-ratio dispense of LSR materials – even with customizable mixing capability. Our solutions accurately process a variety of LSR material volumes and ratio specifications - every application, every time.
More Uptime
Less Waste and More Profits
Liquid Silicone Rubber materials represent a significant part of overall production costs. We understand how the smallest error can lead to expensive material waste and profit loss. Graco Fluid Automation LSR metering systems are engineered to achieve the highest degree of accuracy - maximizing materials, reducing scrapped parts and increasing productivity. Stainless steel components meet the standard for clean room applications to prevent contamination and cure discoloration of material.
Improve LSR Production Efficiency
Graco Fluid Automation’s extensive LSR experience results in equipment that is engineered to reduce cleaning downtime and increase production efficiency. Common challenges such as pressure drops, thread galling and lengthy material change over times are greatly reduced.
Lowest Total Cost of Ownership
Graco LSR metering systems incorporate pumps that can be rebuilt at your facility to eliminate costly external rebuilds and backup pumps. Modular designs to help reduce maintenance costs while improving uptime and throughput.
Increased Confidence
Graco Fluid Automation advanced technologies eliminate guesswork to make sure you hit a specific ratio and volume the first time and every time. Prominent visual indicators confirm on-ratio dispense so you can be confident with the consistency and quality of your final product.
