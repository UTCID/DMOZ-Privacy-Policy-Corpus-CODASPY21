Introduction: The Mabetex Group has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our
customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. We understand that visitors to our website
may have questions about how this website collects and uses information. We have prepared this
statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern Mabetex.eu and Mabetex.com.
This statement contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect your
privacy concerns. The bottom line is that meeting your needs and expectations form the foundation of
everything we do - including protecting your privacy.
Browsing: This website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you
browse the site. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally
identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally
identifiable information.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
when you browse the Internet. When users request a page from our site, our servers log the user's current
IP address. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems. We do not link IP addresses to any personally
identifiable information about you.
Cookies: Our website uses cookie technology. Cookies are strings of text that a website may store on a
user's computer. Our website uses cookies but only requires them in the online reservation process.
Cookies enable our website to keep track of your preferences and activities relating to the website. Our
website creates session cookies for each visit in order to facilitate your visit. The session cookie expires at
the end of the session.
- Use of Cookies and E-Mails - We use a third party service provider to send marketing e-mails on behalf of
Mabetex Group. There are no cookies in the e-mail. However, when an e-mail recipient clicks on a link to
Mabetex Group website included in the e-mail, a persistent cookie is placed on the user's computer. This
cookie is used to measure the effectiveness of our e-mail marketing efforts and better understand how our
users navigate through the site. The cookie set by our service provider will remain on your hard drive 30
days after the last time you clicked on the coded link in the e-mail, or until you delete it.
- Use of Cookies for Advertising - We use third party service providers to serve and host our
advertisements. These third parties use persistent cookies to track the number of times our site is accessed
and whether the site was accessed from the advertisement. The cookies generated from the
advertisements do not contain personally identifiable information and may remain on your hard drive three
or more years unless deleted by you.
The third party service providers mentioned above are contractually bound not to use any information they
gather for any purpose other than providing services to us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your
computer or computer files. In addition, we do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits
to non-Mabetex websites. If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set your browser to reject
the cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may
affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our website.
Pixel Tags: The third party service providers mentioned above serve and host Mabetex advertisements on
other sites. To track the effectiveness of Mabetex advertisements on other sites, Mabetex.eu and
Mabetex.com uses pixel tags (also known as clear gifs, beacon gifs, 1-by-1 gifs, or web bugs). Pixel tags are
not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. If you are visiting Mabetex
Group.com from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag references the cookie you received when
you clicked on the advertisement. The pixel tag then registers this activity with the third party advertising
company to allow us to count the number of times an advertisement is accessed. In addition, we also
measure the reservations generated from a particular ad. At no time is personally identifiable information
about you or your reservation collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking
information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to
report website activity to us or allow us to better target future interactive advertising.
Our third party service providers may use pixel tags in Mabetex Group marketing e-mails that help us send
the e-mail in a format you can read, to allow us to know which e-mails you act upon and to better target
the content of future e-mails. In addition, we track the aggregate number of e-mails read and whether any
of the links in the e-mail were accessed. No other information is collected or used from pixel tags.
Information We Collect: When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will ask
you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a
reservation at our hotel, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, credit card number, and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your e-mail
address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to
process the reservation. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate
transaction. As indicated below (see E-Mail section), we may also use your e-mail address to notify you
about special offers and promotions.
Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information: When we ask you for credit card data when making
a reservation or purchasing a gift certificate, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line
provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.
We also use SSL on other select pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This
ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled
before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode
when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in
the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will
change from http to https. After information reaches Mabetex Group it is stored on a secure server that
resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside the Company.
It is our intention to only send you e-mail communications that will be useful to you and that you want to
receive. When you make a reservation and provide your e-mail address, we will occasionally contact you via
e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These
communications will relate to Mabetex Group offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third
parties with whom Mabetex Group has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or
services that we believe would of interest to you. We use a third party e-mail service provider to send e-
mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send
Mabetex Group related e-mail. Every time you receive e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of
future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail, or you may opt-out by updating your
online profile.
Mabetex Group Use of Information: We treat the information you provide to us as confidential
information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and strict corporate policies
regarding protection and use of confidential information. Because laws applicable to personal information
vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary
depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this privacy
statement, which are listed in the first paragraph, is generally processed and stored in the United States.
The personally identifiable information you provide to us for making a reservation is made available to the
applicable hotel for the purpose of meeting your reservation request. If you cancel your reservation, the
information is stored for recordkeeping purposes only and is not accessed again. After making a reservation
or completing your stay at a Mabetex Group hotel, unless you tell us otherwise, the information you
provide may be used by us for direct marketing of a Mabetex Group hotel, other Mabetex Group products
or the products of select, reputable third parties with whom Mabetex Group has a strategic marketing
relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would of interest to you. Mabetex
Group may use the services of a third party mail house for the sole purpose of mailing materials.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties: Mabetex Group prohibits the sale or transfer of personal
information to entities outside of Mabetex Group for their use without your approval.
Links to Other Sites: If you choose to leave this Mabetex Group site via links to other non-Mabetex Group
websites, including those of advertisers, Mabetex Group is not responsible for the privacy policies or
content of those sites, nor is Mabetex Group responsible for the cookies those sites use.
Legal Issues: This is a Swiss website and is subject to Swiss law. Mabetex Group will disclose personally
identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such
action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Mabetex Group guests, visitors,
associates, or property (including this site), or to others. As mentioned above, laws related to personal
identifiable information vary by country. For example, personally identifiable information collected in the
European Union is subject to the EU Data Protection Directive.

our privacy policy each time you visit our website if you are concerned about how your information will be
used.
Mabetex Group.com Privacy Statement Changes: In the future, we may need to change the privacy
statement for Mabetex Group.com. All changes will be made here so that you will always know what
information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
