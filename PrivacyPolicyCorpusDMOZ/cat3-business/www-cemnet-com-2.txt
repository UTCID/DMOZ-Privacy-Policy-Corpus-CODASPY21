__utma Cookie
First Party
Google analytics
A persistent cookie - remains

visitors. Metrics associated with the Google __utma cookie include: first
visit (unique visit), last visit (returning visit).
__utmb Cookie & __utmc Cookie
First Party
Google analytics
These cookies
work in tandem to calculate visit length. Google __utmb cookie demarks the
exact arrival time, then Google __utmc registers the precise exit time of the
user.
Because
__utmb counts entrance visits, it is a session cookie, and expires at the end
of the session, e.g. when the user leaves the page. A timestamp of 30 minutes
must pass before Google cookie __utmc expires. Given__utmc cannot tell if a
browser or website session ends. Therefore, if no new page view is recorded
in 30 minutes the cookie is expired.

__utmz monitors the HTTP Referrer and notes where a visitor arrived from,
with the referrer siloed into type (Search engine (organic or cpc), direct,
social and unaccounted). From the HTTP Referrer the   __utmz Cookie
also registers, what keyword generated the visit plus geolocation data.
This
cookie lasts six months.
__utmv Cookie
First Party
Google analytics
Google
__utmv Cookie is a persistant cookie. It is used for segmentation, data
experimentation and  the __utmv works hand in hand with the
__utmz cookie to improve cookie targeting capabilities.
