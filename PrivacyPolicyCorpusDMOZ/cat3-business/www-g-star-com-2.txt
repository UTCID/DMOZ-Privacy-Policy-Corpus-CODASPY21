The presentation and advertising of Products in our Website Shop does not constitute a binding offer to conclude a purchase agreement.

The Buyer may select Products from the Seller’s range of Products, particularly clothing, shoes and fashion items in the desired style, color and size, and place these into a “shopping cart” by clicking on the “add to bag” button.

After clicking on the “proceed to delivery” button, the Buyer can choose from three alternative delivery destinations: (a) The Buyer can arrange for the shipment to be delivered to a G-Star RAW Store from which the Buyer can pick up the Products after delivery to this store;(b) The Buyer can arrange for the shipment to be delivered to a pick-up point
(as chosen by the buyer in the check-out process, where available) from which the Buyer can pick up the Products after delivery to this pick-up point;(c) The Buyer can give a shipping address of the Buyer’s choice (such as the Buyer’s home address) to which the Products are to be delivered.

Before clicking the “Pay” button, the Buyer can cancel the order at any time, change the contents of the order by removing existing Products from and/or adding new Products to the shopping cart, and change the shipping address and payment method. We would point out that, with this payment method, the placing of the binding order and payment take place simultaneously.

The Seller shall immediately confirm the receipt of the Order which the Buyer has placed via the Website in an e-mail to the Buyer.
2.6

if the Buyer has already failed to fulfill their payment obligations towards the Seller in the past;
if the Buyer has refused to accept and/or failed to collect any orders which they have placed with the Seller in the past;
