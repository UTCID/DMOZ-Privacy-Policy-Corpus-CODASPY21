HCFCU Is Insured
Each member’s deposits are federally insured to $250,000 by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Additionally, Individual Retirement Account (IRA) deposits are separately insured to $250,000. Health Care Family Credit Union also offers members an additional $250,000 in Excess Share Insurance. There is no safer place for your money!
Affiliations
Credit unions are chartered under either federal or state law. Federally-chartered credit unions are regulated by the NCUA, an independent agency of the U.S. Government. NCUA’s three board members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. State-chartered credit unions are regulated by their state credit union department. NCUA administers the federal insurance fund (NCUSIF), which covers all federal credit unions and most state-chartered credit unions. No taxpayer money is used for regulating and overseeing federal credit unions, as all activities of NCUA and the NCUSIF are funded by credit unions.
