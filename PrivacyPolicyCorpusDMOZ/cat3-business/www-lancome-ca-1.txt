L’ORÉAL CANADA
CONSUMER DATA PRIVACY POLICY
(“Privacy Policy”)
This policy was last updated on March 1st 2019
Thank you for visiting our site, which is part of the L’Oréal Canada Inc. family of brands and brand sites (“L’Oréal”, “us”, “our” or “we”). We place great value on honesty and clarity and we are committed to building a strong and lasting relationship with our consumers based on trust and mutual benefit.
As part of this commitment, we have created this policy to provide you with information about how we collect, use, share and protect information collected from our sites, mobile applications and social media pages (collectively called the “Sites”), when you shop in our stores or when you otherwise interact with us. By providing us with your personal information you agree to the terms of this policy.
This policy applies to consumers residing within Canada only that visit our Sites or our stores. Visitors from other countries should visit the L’Oréal/brand site for your part of the world. This policy does not apply to job applicants. If you submit a job application through the Sites, your personal information will be governed by a separate policy located on the L’Oréal Careers web site.

________________________________________________________________________________
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
“Personal Information” means any information or pieces of information that could identify you either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly (e.g. through pseudonymized data such as a unique ID number). In other words, personal data includes things like email/home addresses/mobile phone, usernames, profile pictures, beauty profiles, personal preferences and shopping habits, user generated content, financial information, and welfare information. It could also include unique numerical identifiers like your computer’s IP address or your mobile device’s MAC address, as well as cookies.
Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregated information that cannot be tracked back to you personally.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES L’OREAL COLLECT FROM ME?
We may collect information that you provide to us directly, information automatically collected and information from third parties. We may combine information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website, our digital advertising) with information that we have collected via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and allow for more customization.
If you submit any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this policy.
Information that I provide directly
If you register on a Site, make purchases through a Site or one of our stores, join a loyalty program, enter a contest or promotion, submit a beauty profile, a consumer survey, photo, video or product review, sign up to receive emails or other offers or communications, we collect and store the information provided, including Personal Information. If you use our virtual try on features, we may collect and store your image(s), for example, if you use social sharing to send your image to a friend or post it online or if you save it to your profile.
Information that I provide through third party social media platforms
We may also offer you the opportunity to engage with our content through third party social media platforms, in which case you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g. name, username, e-mail address, picture). We may use this information to confirm your identity and to personalize your experience.
L’Oréal’s use of social media serves as an extension of its presence on the Internet. Social media account(s) are public and are not hosted on L’Oréal’s servers. Users who choose to interact with L’Oréal via social media, should read the terms of service and privacy policies of these platforms. Please remember that any content submitted to one of our social media platforms can be viewed by the public, so you should be cautious about providing certain personal data e.g. financial information or address details. L’Oréal is not responsible for any harm that results due to posting personal data on one of our social media platforms.
Information that is collected automatically
Mobile Services/Apps:
Certain of our mobile apps offer opt–in, geo–location services and push notifications. Geo-location services provide location–based content and services, such as store locators, local weather, promotional offers and other personalized content. Push notifications can include discounts, reminders or details about local events or promotions. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services or push notifications. If you consent to location services, we will collect information about the Wi–fi routers closest to you and the cell IDs of the towers closest to you to provide location–based content and services.
Site Usage Information:
L’Oréal and its third–party service providers may also use a variety of technologies that passively or automatically collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used including but not limited to your browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the pages served to you, the time you browse, preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Sites.
Device Identifiers:
L’Oréal also automatically collects an IP address or other unique identifier information ("Device Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "Device") you use to access the Sites or on third party websites that publish our advertising. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device by the Device provider when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. For mobile devices, a Device Identifier is a unique string of numbers and letters stored on your mobile device that identifies it. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Sites, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, deliver advertising and gather broad demographic information.
Cookies:
Like many web sites, we use "Cookies," which are data files that are sent through your web browser to your computer when it is used to visit the Sites to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience, including tailoring advertisements. Cookies may also be used to collect your MAC address for analytics purposes or associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Sites and your activities on such social networking sites. Note that cookies may be used and linked to other personal data you have shared with us (such as previous purchases or newsletter subscriptions).
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies. However, please be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. To learn more about cookies, please visit: http://www.allaboutcookies.org
Pixels or Web Beacons:
We use pixel tags or web beacons, which are transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email to indicate that a page or email has been viewed or to let your browser retrieve content from another server. These measure the success of our marketing campaigns for example and compile statistics about usage of our sites and services and response rates.
In-Store Analytics:
We may provide in-store technologies (such as Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons) to help personalize and improve your shopping experience. These technologies may require the collection of certain information about your mobile device, such as your MAC address or other device identification information and may permit you to submit personal details for increased levels of personalization, such as your interests, shopping preferences, and sizing information.
Information collected from third parties:
We may receive information from third party partners, such as publishers that run our advertising and retailers who feature our products. This information includes marketing and demographic data, offline records and information from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them. We may also receive information from other companies that collect or aggregate information from publicly available databases or if you consented to allow them to use and share your information. This might be de-identified information about purchasing patterns, location of shoppers and sites that are of interest to our consumers. We also collect information about users who share common interests or attributes (e.g. color treated hair) to create user “segments,” which help us to better understand and market to our customers. We may use your data as part of health-related segments about non-sensitive conditions such as dry skin.
We may combine such third party data with other information we receive from or about you.
Our websites and Apps may from time to time contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we are not responsible or liable for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
WHAT IF I CONNECT TO THE L’OREAL BRANDS’ IN-STORE WI-FI SERVICES?
If you choose to connect to our in-store Wi-Fi services, L’Oréal will receive information about you and your device, including your device’s MAC address, IP address, and technical details about your device such as its operating system and device type (including make and model) and technical capabilities. We will also receive information about how you use our Wi-Fi network while you are connected, including the store location, the areas of the store you visit, the names and/or Internet addresses of the websites you visit and the applications you use, and how long you interact with such sites or applications. We collect this information each time you connect to the Wi-Fi services and may associate it with other information we have collected from and about you.
If your mobile device is configured to search for available Wi-Fi networks, we may receive information about your device even if you choose not to connect to our Wi-Fi services.
For your convenience, we may provide you with an option to stay connected to the L’Oréal Inc. Wi-Fi networks. If you choose this option, you will be automatically logged into the Wi-Fi network of any of our Brands’ store offering Wi-Fi services, and we may collect the information described above even if you do not actively use your Internet browser or your mobile applications during your time in our store. You can choose to disconnect from the L'Oreal Wi-Fi network at any time through your device’s Wi-Fi settings. However, please note that disconnecting from one store’s Wi-Fi network will only disconnect you from that network during your current visit.
WHERE DOES L’OREAL STORE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Personal Information about you may be maintained and processed on our behalf by our affiliates and other third party service providers inside and outside of Canada including but not limited to the United States. Your Personal Information may be subject to the laws of the countries in which it is stored or used, and those countries may have a different data protection regime than the country in which you reside and under the laws of those other countries, in certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information. By providing us with any personal information, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to other countries, such as the United States, which may have a different privacy regime from your country of residence.

We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices. These other sites may send their own cookies or other tracking technologies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.

The Sites may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

You can opt out of targeted advertising
To learn more about these and other advertising networks and their opt-out instructions,visit the digital Advertising Alliance of Canada at http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices
You can request that your Personal Information not be shared with our advertising partners by contacting PrivacyCanada.CACORP@loreal.com
You can opt out of text/sms message

Consent is not required to purchase goods or services. Message and data rates will apply and you should check the rates of your mobile carrier. You can opt out from further text marketing communications by texting STOP to the SMS number used by L’Oréal to contact you.
We may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the above activities, but we will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own purposes without your consent. You acknowledge that Text Messages are distributed via third party mobile network providers and, therefore, we cannot control certain factors relating to message delivery. You acknowledge that, depending on the recipient's mobile carrier, it may not be possible to transmit the Text Message to the recipient successfully; nor is content available on all carriers. We do not claim or guarantee availability or performance of this service, including liability for transmission delays or message failures.
You have the right to be informed
You have the right to obtain clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your Personal Information and your rights (subject to applicable legal restrictions). This is why we are providing you with the information in this policy.
You have the right to access your Personal Information
Upon a detailed written request, L’Oréal will, in a timely manner and in accordance with the legal timeframe, afford you a reasonable opportunity to review your Personal Information as contained in our files (subject to applicable legal restrictions). In order to safeguard and prevent fraudulent access to personal information, we may take steps to verify your identify or your legal representative before granting access. We may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information. Requests manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive may not be answered to.
You can ask that your Personal Information be changed or deleted
You have the right to have your personal data rectified if it successfully proven to be incorrect or outdated and/or completed if it is incomplete.
You can challenge L’Oréal’s compliance
You have the right to contact our Privacy Guardian (see details below) in order to lodge a complaint against the data protection and privacy practices of L’Oréal.
HOW LONG DOES L’OREAL STORE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR?
L’Oréal retains Personal Information only as long as it is deemed necessary, to fulfill the purposes identified or as required by law. Keep in mind that the retention period for Personal Information may extend beyond your relationship with us. We use the following criteria to determine retention periods:
- Where you purchase products and services or participate in a promotional offer, we keep your Personal Information for the duration of our contractual relationship with you;
- Where you contact us for an enquiry, we keep your personal data for the duration needed to process your enquiry;
- Where you create an account, we keep your Personal Information until you require us to delete it or after a period of inactivity;
- Where you have consented to direct marketing, we keep your personal data until you unsubscribe or require us to delete your information; and
- Where cookies are placed on your computer, we keep them for as long as necessary to achieve their purposes (e.g. for the duration of a session for shopping cart cookies or session ID cookies).
Personal Information no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or no longer required to be retained by law, shall be securely destroyed, erased or made anonymous.
DOES L’OREAL PROTECT CHILDREN’S PRIVACY?
L’Oréal takes seriously its obligations under the Quebec’s Consumer Protection Act. The Sites are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices.
IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?
L’Oréal maintains reasonable safeguards to protect personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, copying or destruction and when transferring information for processing and requires third parties providing services on our behalf to do the same.
No method of transmitting or storing data is 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with L’Oréal websites. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem in order for L’Oréal to resolve the issue in a timely manner. Also keep in mind that e-mail is not a secure form of communication so never send sensitive personal information to us via e-mail.
HOW DO I CONTACT L’OREAL?

We may change information on the Sites and/or this policy, at any time without prior notice to you, and any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised policy on the Sites.
