User Submissions
We have created, or may create in the future, certain areas, such as message boards and chat rooms, within the Website where members can upload and share their thoughts, comments, product reviews, pictures, videos and the like with other members (collectively, "Forums"). These Forums may be available to registered members of the Website only. To help ensure that the text, graphics, software, music, sound, photographs, videos, messages, posts, data, information, or other materials posted by users (collectively, the "User Content") is beneficial for the greater community, we have established some basic rules for everyone to follow.
In addition, if a Forum is provided within the Website, it may allow users to post questions to be answered by experts engaged by us.

We are providing access to the experts and their guidance in the Forum solely as an informational and educational service to members of the Website.
Our policy for this Website is to review User Content, as far as practical, either before or after such User Content is posted. Pre-moderation means that the User Content will not be posted to the Forum and cannot be accessed or viewed by other Website members until we have reviewed it and determined that the User Content is suitable for posting to the Forum. This process also means that User Content submitted for posting will not be posted in real time and may never be posted if we determine that it is unsuitable for the Website. Post-moderation means that User Content will be reviewed by us once it is already posted on the Website. Post-moderated User Content that Site Owner determines does not comply with these Terms or is otherwise unsuitable for the Website will be removed from the Website, without notice to the User.
User Content must be appropriate for the Forum. Without limiting the reasons for which User Content may be rejected by us, we may reject, edit or remove any User Content that does not comply with any Community Guidelines that we provide, which you must read prior to posting any User Content on the Website.
By submitting User Content for posting at a Forum, you also (1) confirm that you are entitled to post or transmit User Content; (2) agree that you are solely responsible for all User Content that you submit for posting; and (3) grant to Site Owner and its affiliated entities an irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully sub-licensable, transferable, royalty-free right and license to use, your User Content in any way on the Website and on any other Website owned or operated by Site Owner or its affiliates (as well as on any social media sites associated with the Site Owner or its affiliates).
We are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in or derived from any User Content for any purpose whatsoever, including developing, manufacturing, and marketing products. Therefore, please do not submit or send to us any ideas, suggestion or materials that you wish to keep confidential or for which you expect to receive compensation. You will not have any claim against us with respect to any use or non-use of User Content. When you submit User Content, you understand that we will have the right, but not the obligation, to use, display and publish your name, photograph, likeness, voice, performance, biographical information and/or statements, throughout the world in perpetuity on the Website and on any affiliate or successor Website or social media channels owned or operated by us or our affiliates. If we make use of any of these rights, you understand and agree that you shall not receive any other consideration, payment, notification or credit, nor will you have any approval over how Site Owner uses them.
You acknowledge that the Forums contain the opinions and views of other users. You acknowledge further that we are not responsible for the accuracy of any User Content on the Website. You understand and agree that all User Content is the sole responsibility of the person who posted the Content. You understand and agree that you will evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any User Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such User Content.
We reserve the right at any time to discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your ability to upload User Content and/or your ability to access User Content with or without notice, at our sole discretion. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any suspension or discontinuance of acceptance of User Content.

Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes and Choice of Law
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and Site Owner agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Site Owner's intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances Site Owner may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
WHAT IS ARBITRATION Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this TOU, the rules set forth in this TOU will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or Site Owner must do the following things
Upon receipt of the notification containing all of the information as outlined in 1 through 6 above:
(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.
Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111
(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys' fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Site Owner, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
