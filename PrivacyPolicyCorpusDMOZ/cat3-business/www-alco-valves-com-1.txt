7. Your rights
7.1 In this section, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights. A general outline can be found at the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at www.ico.org.uk

(b) the right to rectification;
(c) the right to erasure;

For efficiency purposes we may ask you to complete a Subject Access Request Form. Copies of data may be subject to a reasonable fee.
7.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or for the protection of the rights of another party.
7.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
