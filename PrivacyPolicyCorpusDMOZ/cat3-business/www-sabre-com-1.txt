Privacy Statement
Effective April 8, 2020
This Privacy Statement applies to the websites and services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Sabre GLBL Inc. and its affiliates (“Sabre”) to you, unless there is a separately posted privacy statement or description for such Services. This statement also applies to other Sabre Services that display this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement does not apply to personal information processed through our Tripcase or GetThere products.
This Privacy Statement explains generally how we receive personal information about you, and what we do with that personal information once we have it. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information which does not permit identification of an individual. This Privacy Statement applies regardless of the type of device you use to access our Services. You may choose not to provide certain information to us but doing so may restrict your ability to use our Services.
How do you learn information about me?
We learn information about you when you or other businesses interact with us and use our services, including when:
you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to contact us, or make a request for information);
we collect it automatically through our products and Services (e.g., through your use of the Services); or
someone else provides us information about you (e.g., when our client or a third party (such as an employer, travel agency, global distribution system, travel supplier, etc.) provides us your information in order for us to perform Services for them.
What do you do with the information you gather?
Generally, we use your information to help us operate our business, and to provide and improve our products and Services for you and our clients with which you have a business or employment relationship. Sometimes we try to understand more about you based on information you’ve given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address, browser navigator language, or other techniques to customize languages for some of our Services). When permitted by law or elected by you, we may also use the information to provide you information on additional or new Services and features offered by Sabre or its strategic partners, or important information regarding Sabre.
If you have provided information to our client or a third party who shares your information with us or instructs us to collect or process your information, their privacy statement may also apply. You may also have access to other sites through the Sabre websites. These sites may have different privacy practices, and you should read any privacy notices provided on those sites.
Whose information may be processed in connection with the Services?
In connection with the Services, we process information about different types of individuals. As discussed further below, the information that we process about an individual may depend on how he or she interacts with the Services. These different types of individuals include:
Travelers and Those Acting on Their Behalf. Individual consumers and business travelers (“Travelers”) who book tickets, make reservations, or use other travel-related products or services offered by Sabre Subscribers or Travel Suppliers using the Services. Subscribers and Travel Suppliers may collect and send Sabre information about Travelers. Subscribers and Travel Suppliers may have collected such information directly from the Traveler, or from another individual who acts on the Traveler’s behalf. Sabre also may receive information about assistants, or other representatives who book travel-related products or services on behalf of other individuals.
Subscriber and Travel Supplier Staff.  Sabre may collect information about employees and other individuals associated with Sabre Subscribers and Travel Suppliers.  “Subscribers” are travel agents, individuals at travel management companies, corporate travel departments, online travel websites, hoteliers, airlines, and others who subscribe to our Services to search, price, book, ticket, and manage travel services provided by a variety of participating travel suppliers, such as airlines, hotels, cruise lines, car rental companies, rail providers, tour operators, and others (“Travel Suppliers”). For example, if a certain travel agency subscribes to our Services, Sabre might process information about individual travel agents at that agency to help agencies evaluate efficiency.
Other individuals who use our Services or contact us, and certain other individuals (such as sales leads).
When do you share my information with others?
When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
When we’re required to provide it to our client or a third party from whom we received your information, or with whom you have a business or employment relationship. (One such example is when we receive your information from a travel agent with whom you do business, and we provide your information on their behalf to a Travel Supplier, such as an airline.)
For processing or providing products and Services to Sabre or to you.
When we provide information to our business partners to enhance the products and Services we offer.
We may use and share the information we gather to comply with law (including cooperation with regulators or officials), legal process or legal advice.
We may share your information when permitted by law if we believe it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Sabre or the public.
If our organizational structure or status changes (e.g., if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt), we may transfer your information to a successor or affiliate.
We may share information we gather to third parties that our clients have a relationship with such as loyalty providers, hotel property management systems, and other designated businesses that are affiliated with our client, in order to provide Services.
We may share information we gather to otherwise operate our business, including to provide travel marketplace and travel management services. For example, information we gather may be shared with travel agents, travel management companies, corporate travel departments, online travel websites, and others, and with Travel Suppliers, such as airlines, hotels, cruise lines, car rental companies, rail providers, tour operators, and others.
How do you store and protect information about me?
We implement physical, administrative and technical security measures designed to protect your personal information. Sabre is not responsible for unauthorized access to such information by hackers or others that obtain access through illegal measures.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Any content, including information, that you contribute to be shared, published, or displayed on the Services, or transmitted to other users of the Services, either via the Services or via social networking or other third party sites available through the Services, is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.  We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Services.  You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your content, including information, that you contribute to be shared, published, or displayed on the Services, or transmitted to other users of the Service, may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users.

No matter what country your personal information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this Privacy Statement.
