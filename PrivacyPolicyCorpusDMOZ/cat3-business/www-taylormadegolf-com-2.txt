Products, Content and Specifications
All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described or depicted on the TaylorMade Websites are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the TaylorMade Websites at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time.  From time to time, certain product listings on the TaylorMade Websites may show a product’s original price stricken through, alongside a reduced price.  These products may be non-current models and may be on permanent markdown.
Applicability of Content
Information on this site includes description of products and services that may be available in the United States of America only. This site is operated in the State of California, United States of America, and TaylorMade makes no representation that the content provided is applicable or appropriate for use in other locations.
Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights
You and TaylorMade agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and TaylorMade hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and TaylorMade relating to these Terms or the TaylorMade Websites (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”) in San Diego, California. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, TaylorMade will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or TaylorMade from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and TaylorMade also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and TaylorMade retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.
Neither you nor TaylorMade may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or TaylorMade’s individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with TaylorMade.
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR TAYLORMADE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

Enforcement of Terms and Conditions
These Terms are governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without reference to its provisions concerning conflicts of law.
Without limiting the arbitration agreement set forth above, you agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or the TaylorMade Websites will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the County of San Diego, State of California). You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.
If any part of these Terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. TaylorMade may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting.
Under no circumstances will TaylorMade be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond its reasonable control.
The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent TaylorMade from enforcing such right or provision in the future.
TaylorMade may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.
TaylorMade reserves the right to not provide the TaylorMade websites to any person.  TaylorMade also reserves the right to terminate any user’s right to access the TaylorMade websites at any time, in its discretion.  If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the TaylorMade websites automatically terminates.
From time to time, TaylorMade may change these Terms.  If TaylorMade changes these Terms, it will give you notice by posting the revised Terms on the TaylorMade Websites.  Those changes will go into effect on the Revision Date shown in the revised Terms.  BY CONTINUING TO USE THE TAYLORMADE WEBSITES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE REVISED TERMS.
PLEASE PRINT A COPY OF THESE TERMS FOR YOU RECORDS AND PLEASE CHECK THE TAYLORMADE WEBSITES FREQUENTLY FOR ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS.
