The tech sector’s ongoing commitment to sustainability extends beyond our products to encompass our global sourcing practices and supply chains. Our companies have been the unquestioned drivers on regulatory efforts and public-private initiatives to combat the use of conflict minerals in industrial manufacturing.
Our sector recognizes the serious social and environmental implications of illegal mining and mineral trading. Any mining activities that fuel conflict are unacceptable, and the tech sector will continue to work with the international community to drive transparency and responsible sourcing practices within global supply chains. While tech is only one of many major industries that rely on these metals, we continue to advance industry engagement and are working with all participants toward an effective solution. As part of this commitment, we are engaged in an ongoing and productive dialogue with leading NGOs.
Working through the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI), the high-tech sector has pioneered the Conflict-Free Smelter Program to drive clean minerals sourcing across global supply chains. Several tech companies and suppliers have also partnered to launch the Solutions for Hope Project to source conflict-free tantalum from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and provide economic support and jobs.
Numerous tech sector companies support the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), a joint initiative launched by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, with participants from government, civil society, and the private sector. The high tech sector has also led industry engagement on the development of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. Since 2012, ITI has been engaging with European Union officials to discuss how best to coordinate government, civil society, and private sector initiatives to address the root causes of conflicts that may be tied to minerals extraction.
