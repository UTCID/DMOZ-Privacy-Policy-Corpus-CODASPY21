WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
Your privacy is important to us.
To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy, which explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way in which your information is collected and used on this website (this "Website").
Please see our Terms and Conditions for additional information applicable to your use of our Website.
By accessing or using any areas of our Website, you expressly consent to the provisions of the Privacy Policy and to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of information obtained from you as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Information We Collect
You do not have to give us personally identifiable information in order to access and browse our Website.
However, while on our Website, you may be able to order and buy products, enter promotions, sweepstakes or other contests, participate in a survey, complete a questionnaire or other "information request" form, or otherwise communicate with us, including via email and/or SMS/text messaging.
In order to utilize, participate in or otherwise access such products, services or other offerings, you may be required to provide us with your personally identifiable information, which is information that, alone or in combination with other information, allows us to indentify you, such as your name, address, phone number, e mail address, contact preferences, credit card information, financial information or information relating to a support or service issue.
If you provide us with your personally identifiable information, you are giving us permission to use that information for the specific purpose for which it is provided and for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy, which are described in detail below under "How We Use the Information".
Users unwilling to provide personally identifiable information online can choose not to provide such information, and in some (but not all) situations users may be able to work with a sales representative or customer service representative to utilize our services or other site offerings without providing personally identifiable information.
IN ADDITION, IF YOU DO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREVENT US FROM SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES IF YOU WISH, AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER "Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information".
We also may collect, store and use certain non-personally identifiable information we receive when you visit our Website or otherwise communicate with us, including via email and/or SMS/text messaging, and we may aggregate data and information provided by or collected from multiple users (which may include you) in a manner that is not personally identifiable to any individual user.
All non-personally identifiable information we collect and all aggregated/compilations of data we create are our exclusive property.
Nothing in this Privacy Policy limits our right to use any such non-personally identifiable or aggregated information in any way (including, but not limited to, monitoring user traffic patterns, analyzing and quantifying user preferences, improving the design and content of our Website, and enabling us to personalize your user experience) or prohibits us from sharing non-personally identifiable or aggregated information with third parties.
How We Use the Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we share personally identifiable information collected on our Website with unaffiliated third parties only as described below.
(Please see "Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information" below for information on how to avoid having your personally identifiable information shared by us.)
Business Providers; Unaffiliated Businesses: At times, we may provide products, services or offerings on our Website in cooperation with an unaffiliated third party.
We may share personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with any such products, services or offerings with the unaffiliated third party(ies) involved in your particular product, service or offering.
For instance, when you express interest in products, services or other items that we offer (for example, by completing a request for or information regarding such services), we will share your request with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services and other offerings (collectively, "Business Providers").
By electing to participate or otherwise expressing interest in any such product, service or offering conducted in conjunction with any Business Provider, you expressly authorize us to provide your personally identifiable information to those Business Providers.
Please be aware that the Business Providers with whom we share your personally identifiable information may retain or use your information whether or not you use their services, and the privacy and information sharing practices of such Business Providers may differ from those described in this Privacy Policy.
Additionally, we may share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties to whom you expressly ask us to send your information.
If you prefer not to be contacted by any such Business Provider or other third party with whom we share your personally identifiable information, you may follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any email you receive from any such third party.
In addition, you may opt out of our sharing your personally identifiable information with Business Providers and other third parties by following the instructions described below under "Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information".
Third Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
Examples may include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service.
In connection with their performance of these functions on our behalf, we may share personally identifiable information with such companies and individuals as needed for them to perform their functions.
Third Party Promotions: We may send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of unaffiliated businesses that want to market their products or services to you, and as part of these promotional offers we may sell or disclose certain of your personally identifiable information to such unaffiliated businesses.
If you prefer not to be contacted by any such business with whom we share your personally identifiable information, you may follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any email you receive from any such third party.
In addition, you may opt out of our sharing your personally identifiable information with such businesses by following the instructions described below under "Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information".
In-House Promotions: We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market our products and services that may be of interest to you.
If you have signed up to receive our e-mails or SMS/text messages and prefer not to receive marketing information from us, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from us or by following the instructions described below under "Unsubscribe Requests".
Protection of Our Website and Others: We reserve the right to release personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties when we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Website Terms and Conditions and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others.
This includes exchanging information with other unaffiliated third parties in connection with fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice and have the opportunity to withhold consent when personally identifiable information about you might be shared with unaffiliated third parties.
Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information
Except where we believe the release of your personally identifiable information is necessary or appropriate (a) to allow third party service provider functions on our behalf or (b) to comply with law, enforce or apply our Website Terms and Conditions and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others, you may opt out of our sharing of your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties by sending us an email with "OPT OUT" in the subject line.
