ISO 9001:2015 Certification
We are currently certificated to the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 by Intertek Group PLC, who are accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). UKAS, as an accreditation body, work with other similar bodies around the world to ensure that the standard of auditing is uniform and adequate. Some certification bodies do not have this accreditation and therefore the standard of their auditing has not been independently verified.
