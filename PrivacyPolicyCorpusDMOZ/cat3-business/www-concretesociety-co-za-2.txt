This is the privacy statement of the Concrete Society of Southern Africa NPC. In this document, “we”, “our” or “us” refer to the Concrete Society of Southern Africa.
We are a non-profit company registered in South Africa with registration number: 1996/009468/08.
Our registered office is at Suite 423, Fourth Floor, 318 The Hillside Road, Lynnwood, Pretoria, 0081.
This is a statement to communicate our policy regarding all information that we record about you. It covers both information that could identify you and information that could not.
We are totally committed to protecting your privacy and confidentiality, understanding that all users of our website are concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with the South African law and with the laws of all jurisdictions of which we are aware, but if you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.
Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site.
Here is a list of the information we collect from you, either through our website or because you give it to us in some other way (e.g. e-mailed membership application forms), and why it is necessary to collect it:
1. Business and personal information
This includes basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details and also includes all information given to us in the course of your business and ours, such as information you give us in your capacity as our member. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship. It is not used for any other purpose.
This information is used:
1.1.to provide you with the services which you request;
1.2.for verifying your identity for security purposes;
1.3.for marketing our activities, services and publications;
1.4.information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service.
We keep information, which forms part of our business record for a minimum of five years. That is because we may need it in some way to support a claim or defence in court. That is also the period within which our tax collecting authorities may demand to know it.
2. Your domain name and e-mail address
This information is recognised by our servers, and the pages that you visit are recorded. We shall not under any circumstances, divulge your e-mail address to any person who is not an employee or volunteer of ours and who does not need to know, either generally or specifically. This information is used:
2.1.  to correspond with you or deal with you as you expect
2.2.  in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site
2.3.  to send you news about the services to which you have signed up
3. Website usage information
We may use software embedded in our website (such as JavaScript) to collect information about pages you view and how you have reached them, what you do when you visit a page, the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing content to you. We do not associate such information with an identifiable person.
4. Note on padlock symbols and other trust marks
Many companies offer certification and an icon or other small graphic to prove to site visitors that the site is safe. Some certify to a high level of safety. Others are more concerned to take our money than to provide a useful service. We do not handle information about your credit card so do not subscribe to any such service.
5. Third party advertising
Third parties may advertise on our website. In doing so, those parties, their agents or other companies working for them may use technology that automatically collects your IP address when they send an advertisement that appears on our site to your browser. They may also use other technology such as cookies or JavaScript to personalise the content, and to measure the performance, of their adverts. We do not have control over these technologies or the data that these parties obtain. Accordingly, this privacy notice does not cover the information practices of these third parties.
6. Information we obtain from third parties
Although we do not disclose your personal information to any third party (except as set out in this notice), we do receive data which is indirectly made up from your personal information, from software services such as Google Analytics and others. No such information is identifiable to you.
7. Content you provide to us with a view to be used by third party
If you provide information to us with a view to it being read, copied, downloaded or used by other people, we accept no responsibility for what that third party may do with it. It is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might see your information. If it is available to all the World, you have no control whatever as to how it is used.
8. Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive through your web browser when you visit any web site. They are widely used to make web sites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
Like all other users of cookies, we may request the return of information from your computer when your browser requests a web page from our server. Cookies enable our web server to identify you to us, and to track your actions and the pages you visit while you use our website. The cookies we use may last for a single visit to our site (they are deleted from your computer when you close your browser) or may remain on your computer until you delete them or until a defined period has passed.

We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our organisation.
10. Complaining
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us. We use that information to resolve your complaint. If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and, if we do, what that information is.
We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
11. Use of site by children
We do not market to children, nor do we sell products or services for purchase by children. We do sell products and services for end use by children, but for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use our site only with consent from a parent or guardian.
12. Disclosure to Government and their agencies
We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request, or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
13. Compliance with the law
This confidentiality policy has been compiled to comply with the law of every jurisdiction in which we aim to do business. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your country, we should like to hear from you, but ultimately it is your choice as to whether you wish to use our website.

At any time, you may review or update the personally identifiable information that we hold about you, by contacting us at This email address is being protected from spambots.
