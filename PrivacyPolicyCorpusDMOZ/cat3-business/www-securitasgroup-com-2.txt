Environmental Policy Reduces Emissions
Environmental Policy Reduces Emissions
Securitas has an environmental policy, which is updated every year. Our main focus is on reducing emissions from transportation.
Securitas is a service company with a relatively small environmental impact compared, for example, with the manufacturing industry. The Group's operations do not require a permit under Swedish environmental legislation. Our main environmental responsibility is to reduce the level of emissions generated from our transportation activities.
Focus on reducing emissions
The Securitas Group emissions policy, which is updated every year, stipulates that new company cars purchased after November 15, 2019 may generate a maximum of 160 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometer, according to the measuring method WLTP (125 grams according to the NEDC method). For minivans, the limit is 170 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometer according to NEDC and 200 grams according to WLTP.
The goal is to gradually, on an annual basis, reduce the emissions generated by the company cars and minivans owned and leased by Securitas around the world. Since 2008, the average emissions from these vehicles have declined from 173 grams of CO2 per kilometer to 141 grams of CO2 per kilometer (NEDC).
Environmental policy with three goals
Securitas also has an environmental policy for its operations, which focuses on three overall goals:
Reduce the company's negative climate impact, particularly with respect to energy and transportation
Avoid using environmentally hazardous substances and work to replace such substances with more environmentally friendly alternatives, even if this results in a higher cost for the company
Contribute to recycling processes and ensure waste is handled in a safe, environmentally friendly manner
A basic requirement is that we follow all prevailing laws, international agreements and other regulations that impact our operations.
Local environmental initiatives
Securitas also implements local initiatives to improve its environmental performance. For example, opt for video conferences rather than business travel whenever possible, change to renewable energy for heating or cooling of offices, recycle paper and other materials and use web-based manuals, process descriptions and training documents rather than printed materials.
Securitas a participant in CDP
Securitas participates in CDP, a global reporting system for climate change. In 2018, Securitas received a score of Performance band C. The average score for the companies in the CDP climate change program is Performance band C. This score is based on an evaluation of the company's activities in the areas of climate change, adaptation and transparency.
