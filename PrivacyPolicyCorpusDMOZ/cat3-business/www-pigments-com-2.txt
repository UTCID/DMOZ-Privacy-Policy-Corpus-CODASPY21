PRIVACY
Our Privacy Policy states in full our policy regarding how we handle information that we collect about you or that you choose to submit to us.
GENERAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO E-COMMERCE
Reference to any product on the Site does not constitute an offer to sell or supply that product and does not mean that the product is available. The information in this Site is based on extensive testing and application experience and is believed to be a reliable indication of the results that may be expected. However, this information does not constitute a specification for the products, and is offered only as a guide to performance without guarantee or warranty of any kind. Because of the difficulties of modern color reproduction, the shades may vary slightly from the final color application. Since many variables have a strong influence on pigment performance, users are encouraged to test each product in their own laboratory prior to use.
Where applicable, our policies relating to shipping and return/replacement of products are posted on the Site for your review. Review those policies prior to purchasing products from the Site.
Prices and availability of products listed on the Site are subject to change without notice.
While we strive to provide accurate product and pricing information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical error, or any other reason, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order placed for such product at the incorrect price, even if the order has been confirmed and/or your payment method or account has been charged. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. If your payment method or account has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we shall promptly issue a credit to your payment method or account in the amount of the incorrect price.
There may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to limit the quantity of items purchased. These restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by or using the same online account, the same payment method, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. We will provide notification to the customer should such limits be applied.
Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is cancelled after your payment method or account has been charged, we will issue a credit to your payment method or account in the amount of the charge.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This is the entire agreement regarding the matters discussed in the preceding paragraphs.
