Privacy Policy
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Global Recruiters
Network. This privacy notice applies solely to
information collected by this web site.
Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United
States. The information we gather on the our site may be shared within the
Global Recruiters Network-affiliated companies on a worldwide basis in order
to deliver the products and services we offer to employers such as searches
for job seekers or in order to undertake analysis of our database such as
aggregate profiling of our registered users.
The Global Recruiters Network site may contain
links to other Web sites over which we have no control. We are not
responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to
which you choose to link from our Sites. We encourage you to review the
privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they
collect, use and share your information.
Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only
have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or
other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to
anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
contacted us.
We will not share your information with any third party outside of our
organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to a
potential employer.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to
tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this
privacy policy.
Your Access to and Control Over Information

Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both
online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data),
that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can
verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web
browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web
page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted
online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need
the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are
kept in a secure environment.
