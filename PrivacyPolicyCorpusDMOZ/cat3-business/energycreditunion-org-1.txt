Customer Identification Program
Under the Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act (which aims to protect our country’s financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing and to protect consumers against fraud, including identity theft), credit unions must implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP) to obtain and verify certain kinds of identifying information from anyone opening an account. Credit unions must apply the CIP to each person who establishes a new account, including members, joint accountholders and co-borrowers. To comply with the Act, we obtain and verify four items of information from each new member, including name, date of birth, address and an identification number, such as a social security number.
