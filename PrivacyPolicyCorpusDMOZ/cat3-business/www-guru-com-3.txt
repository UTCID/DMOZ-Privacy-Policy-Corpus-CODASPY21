Relationship
(A) Employer and Freelancer
Job Agreement:
The engagement, contracting and management of a Job are between an Employer and a Freelancer. Upon acceptance of
a Quote, the
Employer
agrees to purchase, and the Freelancer agrees to deliver, the services and related deliverables in accordance with the following agreements:
(a) the Job Agreement between Employer and Freelancer including the Quote, Job Description, and other terms and conditions as communicated
between Employer
and Freelancer on the Website or otherwise,
(b) these Terms of Service, and
(c) any other content uploaded to the Website by Guru.com (collectively, the "Job Agreement"). You agree not to enter into any contractual
provisions in
conflict with these Terms of Service. Any provision of a Job Agreement in conflict with these Terms of Service is void. Employer is
responsible for managing,
inspecting, accepting and paying for satisfactory services and deliverables in accordance with the Job Agreement in a timely manner.
Freelancer is responsible
for the performance and quality of the services in accordance with the Job Agreement in a timely manner. Employer and Freelancer each
covenants and agrees to
act with good faith and fair dealing in performance of the Job Agreement.
Independence: Employer and Freelancer each acknowledges and agrees that their relationship is that of independent contractors. The
Freelancer shall
perform services as an independent contractor and nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency,
or
employer-employee relationship between Freelancer and Employer or between Guru.com and any Employer or Freelancer.
(B) Registered Users and Guru.com
Genral:
Guru.com is not a party to the dealing, contracting and fulfillment of any Job between an Employer and a Freelancer. Guru.com has no

accuracy
of Job listings, the qualifications, background, or abilities of Registered Users, the ability of Freelancers to perform services, the ability
of
Employers to pay for services, or that an Employer or Freelancer can or will actually complete a Job. Guru.com is not responsible for and will
not
control the manner in which a Freelancer operates and is not involved in the hiring, firing, discipline or working conditions of the Freelancer. All
rights and obligations for the purchase and sale of services or other deliverables are solely between an Employer and a Freelancer. Guru.com will
not
provide any Freelancer with any materials or tools to complete any Job. Employers and Freelancers must look solely to the other for enforcement
and
performance of all the rights and obligations arising from Job Agreements and any other terms, conditions, representations, or warranties
associated
with such dealings.
Third-Party Beneficiary of Job Agreement:
Employer and Freelancer each acknowledges and agrees that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the
Website depend on their performance of their covenants and agreements as set forth in their Job Agreement. Employer and Freelancer therefore
appoint
Guru.com as a third-party beneficiary of their Job Agreement for purposes of enforcing the obligations owed to, and the benefits conferred on,
Guru.com by these Terms of Service. Employers and Freelancers further agree that Guru.com has the right to take such actions with respect to the
Job Agreement or their Accounts, including without limitation, suspension, termination, or any other legal actions, as Guru.com in its sole discretion
deems
necessary to protect the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Website.

creating or implying any relationship of agency, franchise, partnership or joint venture between you and Guru.com, except and solely to the extent
expressly stated.

parties pursuant to the terms of any provision of tax services provided to you by Guru.com. You agree that you will abide by any and all applicable

until after the occurrence of an Employer's Acceptance of Services. You acknowledge that such funds will belong to Guru.com immediately upon such
funds
being transferred to Guru.com by you. However, Guru.com agrees to refund such funds to Employer in the event that (a) a Freelancer acknowledges that
services have not been completed or (b) Employer and Freelancer have concluded the process comprising the Arbitration Service with a result
indicating that Employer is the rightful recipient of such funds. Guru.com agrees to keep both Employer and Freelancer informed as to the status of
the Assumed Payment Liability and if, for any reason, a party requests Arbitration Service regarding such status, will notify both parties that
the matter will be addressed through the Arbitration Service.
SafePay Disputes:

Employer and Freelancer agree that Guru.com shall have no payment obligations to any party related to relevant fees until such dispute is resolved
