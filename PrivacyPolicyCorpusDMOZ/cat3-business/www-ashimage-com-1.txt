CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (CMS)
Updating your web site just got easier:
simply point+click to add text, insert photos, or embed videos--no HTML, scripting, or technical skills needed.
Because
our advanced CMS is seamlessly-integrated into your site, it's easier to use than WordPress and Joomla and far more secure.
Our icon-based toolbars and style
presets ensure formats are consistent across pages, no matter who in your organization is editing them, and all changes are automatically backed-up just in
case.  We invite you to contact us for a full demonstration, but here's a quick preview of some of the easy editing tasks you can accomplish with your custom CMS:
EXPERIENCE THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
For over 20 years, ASHimagine has been dreaming-up solutions to clients' biggest challenges.
From web-based database systems to interactive sites, e-commerce storefronts to content-rich presentations, our projects come in all shapes and sizes.
But no matter the scope or budget, our hands-on team consistently produces sky-high results for start-ups and Fortune500 corporations alike through our Holistic Approach.
A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING
Did you know that the overwhelming majority of designers are not developers?
And that most developers don't design?
An individual is usually either a designer or a developer but not both.
Our team members are the exception, and that's what makes our work exceptional.
To us, design and development should not be opposing tasks outsourced to separate minds.
Instead, solutions should evolve from a singular mind that comprehends both.
We unite art and technology.
We marry form and function.
We create and code.
That's our holistic approach.
CLIENTS OF EVERY SHAPE + SIZE
We've worked with everyone from entrepreneurs to executive directors to executive boards.
From arborists to attorneys to auto detailers.
Sometimes we even work hand-in-hand with business consultants and professional service providers like videographers, writers, and marketers.
Long ago, we decided against putting all of our eggs in one basket (industry) and have enjoyed the diversity.
Our clients benefit from our range of experiences, too, as we introduce new ideas into established industry practices.

CLIENT WORK
A SAMPLE OF OUR CAPABILITIES
For over 20 years, we've been designing sites and systems that clients use as the anchor for their marketing, business, and data strategies. We've selected a few of our favorites for you to peruse, but please keep in mind this is only a small sample of the 600+ clients we've been fortunate enough to work with over the years.
Additionally, we are not able to show some of our biggest projects, including several on the Fortune 500 and 1000 lists, due to contractual disclosure preclusions. The clients denoted by a logo indicate the use of internal database systems not available for public viewing.

ABOUT THE FIRM
HAND-CRAFTED SITES DELIVERED WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH.
What's a "hand-crafted" site?
Unlike off-the-shelf templates that get reused over and over and over again, each of our sites begins as a blank slate and an idea.
Or sometimes a bunch of ideas.
We bring these ideas to life as concepts and grow them through ongoing, open-door conversations with the client, allowing us to hear their feedback, make recommendations, and evolve the site into a fully working model. Our custom method is the polar opposite of template-based services, and we feel the results speak for themselves in terms of uniqueness, cohesiveness, and flexibility.
Our projects have that "personal touch". Instead of being passed along from salesman to manager to designer to developer and back and forth, our clients interact with one person from proposal to production.
That consistency and individualized attention makes a big difference in terms of progression and accountability.
Factor in that we don't outsource and are highly selective in the projects we choose, and you'll find that we have an impeccable record for customer satisfaction, referrals, and repeat business.
We've made our business personal. Doesn't your project deserve such a promise?
GREAT CAUSES DISCOUNT PROGRAM
From the beginning, we've understood the importance of the programs doing great work within our community.
That's why we always try to give-back through volunteering and donation of services.
Some of the clients to which we have contributed include Columbus Coalition for the Homeless, MHAFC, American Red Cross, Charitable Pharmacy of Central Ohio, Ohio Community Corrections Association, and many other organizations that do such great work despite their limited resources.
Not-for-profits do big things with small resources, and we can relate to and appreciate that fact.
Through our Great Causes Discount Program, we're trying to do our part, too, by donating up to 30% of a project's hours based on a variety of factors.
The point is that we would like to work with you to deliver the best solution possible for your non-profit and don't want a little thing like price to keep that from happening.
Just let us know what it'll take to work together, and we'll do our best to overcome the financial restrictions.
