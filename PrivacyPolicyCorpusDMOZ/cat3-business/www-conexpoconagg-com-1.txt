We are committed in complying with Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation ("CASL").

CASL regulates all commercial electronic messages sent within, to, or from Canada (“CEM”), which are messages that include (inter alia) the encouragement of participation in a commercial activity.
In addition to this anti-spam communication, to show transparency of how your data will be handled, we have undertaken the following initiatives:
We have implemented CASL compliant consent forms.
Your consent is necessary in order for us to use your personal information to send a CEM. This consent typically must be “express”, but in certain circumstances can be “implied”. We have modified certain forms in order to ensure that your express consent is obtained. In addition, you can determine and manage your communication preferences by going to the Subscription Center from any CEM received from us, including having your email address removed from our mailing lists at any time. You may still receive electronic messages to the extent that they are exempt under CASL or implied consent has been given as set out below.
We may infer implied consent if:
We have an existing business relationship with you or had a business relationship with you which terminated less than two years ago;
We received an inquiry from you within the last 6 months;
You disclosed your contact details to one of our employees (for example you provided us with your business card or connected with us via social media).
We have modified our email footers.
Under CASL, all CEM must include certain prescribed content. For example, we must clearly identify ourselves as the party sending the CEM and provide a method whereby you can readily contact us.
We have incorporated "unsubscribe" mechanisms (explained below).
Some messages are specifically exempt from consent requirements. The following messages are exempt:
You have a personal relationship with one of our employees with whom you have previously had a direct, voluntary, two-way communication;
You have a family relationship with one of our employees who contacted you;
The CEM is sent to one of our affiliated companies;
The CEM was sent in response to your request or inquiry; or
The CEM was sent in order to enforce a legal right or obligation (for example, if you have an outstanding debt, or breached a contract that you have with us).

You may also have a right, in certain circumstances, to have your personal data blocked or erased or request that we stop processing your personal information.

These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.
