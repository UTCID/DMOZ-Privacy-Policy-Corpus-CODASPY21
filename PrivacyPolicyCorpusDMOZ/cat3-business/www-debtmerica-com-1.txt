(a) IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE WEBSITE, THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND ANY CONTROVERSY, CLIAM OR DISPUTE ARISING PRIOR TO THIS AGREEMENT OR AFTER ITS TERMINATION ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANYWAY RELATED TO PHONE CALLS OR OTHER ATTEMPTED CONTACT, SHALL BE SOLELY DETERMINED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, OR IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH YOU RESIDE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR AGREEMENTS TO BE MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN CALIFORNIA, OR UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE CLIENT RESIDES FOR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS.
(b) ANY CLAIMANT UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST FIRST SUBMIT TO THE OTHER PARTY A WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIM AGAINST OR DISPUTE WITH THE OTHER PARTY, SUCH NOTICE MUST INCLUDE ANY EXPLANATION OF THE CLAIM AND A STATEMENT OF THE CLAIMANT’S REQUEST FOR RESOLUTION. THE PARTY RECEIVING THE CLAIM OR DISPUTE SHALL THEN BE ENTITLED TO A PERIOD OF SIXTY (60) DAYS TO CURE SUCH CLAIM OR DISPUTE. IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM OR DISPUTE WITHIN SUCH 60-DAY PERIOD, THEN THE CLAIM OR DISPUTE SHALL BE SOLELY RESOLVED, ON AN INDIVIDUAL, NON-CLASS BASIS, BY BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR. PRIOR TO THE CLAIMANT COMMENCING ARBITRATION, THE PARTIES SHALL MUTUALLY AGREE UPON THE ARBITRAL INSTITUTION THAT WILL ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION. IN THE EVENT THAT NO ARBITRAL INSTITUTION CAN BE AGREED UPON, THEN THE PARTIES AGREE TO USE JAMS. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED PURSUANT TO THE MUTUALLY AGREED ARBITRAL INSTITUTION’S RULE AND PROCEDURES AND A SINGLE ARBITRATOR WILL BE SELECTED THEREFROM.
(c) THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE NEUTRAL AND INDEPENDENT, LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE ARBITRATION IS TAKING PLACE AND SHALL COMPLY WITH THE ARBITRAL INSTITUTION’S CODE OF ETHICS AND HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE DISPUTE.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ON PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDINGS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES SHALL BEAR THE COST OF ARBITRATION INCLUDING, ATTORNEY’S FEES, SEPARATELY. IF THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT A PARTY HAS GENERALLY PREVAILED IN THE ARBITRATION PRECEDING, THEN THE ARBITRATOR SHALL AWARD TO THAT PARTY ITS REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES AND LEGAL COSTS. IN THE EVENT A PARTY FAILS TO PROCEED WITH ARBITRATION OR UNSUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGES THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD, THE OTHER PARTY IS ENTITLED TO COSTS OR FUIT, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEE FOR HAVING TO COMPEL ARBITRATION OR DEFEND OR ENFORCE THE AWARD. THIS SECTION AND THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE OR USE OF THE WEBSITE.
(d) SHOULD ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT – EXCEPTING THE REQUIREMENT THAT ARBITRATION PROCEED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY – BE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE, IT SHALL BE DEEMED SEVERABLE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE ENFORCED.
Limitation on Time to File Claims

Debtmerica Website Disclaimer: Last Updated as of Jun 8, 2020 Clients that are able to make the monthly program payments generally experience a 50% reduction of
their enrolled balance before fees, or approximately a 29% reduction after payment of fees over a 24-48

program, the creditors in your individual portfolio, and amount of debt enrolled. Statements made are

qualification requirements. If you are enrolled in one of Debtmerica, LLC’s, affiliate’s performance based
programs, Debtmerica, LLC and/or its affiliate will not receive any fees until the terms of your debt have
been altered with one or more of your creditors. However, if you are enrolled in one of Debtmerica,
LLC’s, affiliate’s attorney-based debt settlement programs, then Debtmerica, LLC and/or its affiliate may
receive fees prior to any settlement being obtained with a creditor. While our programs work
aggressively to reduce your debt balances, creditors are under no contractual obligation to negotiate or
accept settlement offers. We do not assume consumer debt, make monthly payments to creditors or
provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice and we do not provide credit repair services. Please
