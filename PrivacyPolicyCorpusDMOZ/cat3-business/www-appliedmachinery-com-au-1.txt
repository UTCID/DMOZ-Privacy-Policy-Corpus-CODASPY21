(a) the nature of the Goods to be provided;
(b) any specifications for the relevant Goods;
(c) the time frame within which the Supplier estimates that the Goods could be supplied;
(d) the proposed term during which specified services would be provided;
(e) where the Goods are to be supplied;

Quotation, Ordering and Variation of Goods
2. The Supplier will supply, and the Customer will accept receipt of, the Goods identified in any Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions
in these Terms.
3. The Customer may request one or more variations to the Goods. If requested to do so by the Customer, the Supplier may issue a Quotation for any
variation required by the Customer. Subject to clauses 4 and 5, a Quotation will remain open for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue, or such
other period as specified in the Quotation. If the Supplier does not receive an Order in response to that Quotation within that period (or a different period
if the Supplier agrees), the Quotation will lapse.
4. The Supplier may withdraw a Quotation at any time prior to the Customer issuing an Order, after which time the Quotation ceases to have effect.
5. Any Quotation is based on the information that was made available to the Supplier at the time of the Quotation. If that information (including the price
charged by any supplier or manufacturer of any item forming part of the Goods and the relevant exchange rate) changes or is incorrect or if a change to
the Goods is required, the Supplier may vary the Quotation or its pricing for the Goods at any time.
6. If the Customer wishes to order the Goods referred to in a Quotation, it must place an Order in writing with the Supplier for those Goods before the
Quotation period expires or is withdrawn. By placing an order, the Order incorporates the terms of the Quotation and these Terms.
7. If the Customer requests any variation to the Goods specified in a Quotation, or places an Order inconsistent with the Quotation, the Supplier is not
obliged to supply, and any Accepted Order will be deemed to exclude any terms or conditions in the Order that are inconsistent with these Terms and
the Quotation in the resulting Agreement.

consist of the following documents:
(a) these Terms;
(b) the Quotation;
(c) any terms of the Supplier’s notification of its acceptance of the Customer’s Order; and
(d) the Customer’s Order (specifically excluding any terms or conditions in the Order that are inconsistent with these Terms and the Quotation).
In the event of an inconsistency between those documents referred to above, the document appearing earlier will prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.
9. Any terms or conditions contained in any Order or any other document that may be issued by the Customer or in any correspondence or documents
passing between the Supplier and the Customer:
(a) have no effect, and will not affect any agreement between the Supplier and the Customer referred to in in clause 8 even if the Supplier has had
notice of those terms or conditions; and
(b) do not constitute an offer or a counter-offer by the Customer.
10. Without limiting the generality of clause 8, these Terms will also apply in any instance where the Customer accepts delivery of Goods from or
collects Goods from the Supplier unless the parties agree in writing to the contrary.
11. The Supplier will only be responsible for those Goods specifically identified as the Supplier’s responsibility in the Agreement, or as otherwise agreed
in writing by the parties from time to time.

ready for collection then:
(a) the Supplier may hold the Goods;
(b) unless specified to the contrary by the Supplier, delivery shall be deemed to have occurred and the Goods shall be at the Customer’s risk from the

supply the Goods (including for loss of profits, use, data, or other economic advantage), regardless of how it arises, whether for breach of these Terms
or the Agreement or in tort, and even if a party has been previously advised of the possibility of such damage; and
(b) the delay or failure shall not:
(i) relieve the Customer of its obligation to pay the Purchase Price; or
(ii) permit the Customer to rescind the Contract and/or reject the Goods.

the Customer or collection of the Goods by the Customer.
25 If any of the Goods are damaged or destroyed following delivery or collection but prior to ownership passing to the Customer, the Supplier is entitled
to receive all insurance proceeds payable for the Goods. The production of these terms and conditions by the Supplier is sufficient evidence of the
Supplier’s rights to receive the insurance proceeds without the need for any person dealing with the Supplier to make further enquiries
26 The Supplier and the Customer agree that ownership of such Goods shall not pass until:
(a) the Customer has paid the Supplier for the Goods; and

insurance in the event of the goods being lost, damaged or destroyed;
(c) the Customer must not sell, dispose, or otherwise part with possession of the goods other than in the ordinary course of business and for market
value. If the Customer sells, disposes or parts with possession of the Goods then the Customer must hold the proceeds of any such act on trust for the
Supplier and must pay or deliver the proceeds to the Supplier on demand;
(d) the Customer should not convert or process the goods or intermix them with other goods but if the Customer does so then the Customer holds the
resulting product on trust for the benefit of the Supplier and must sell, dispose of or return the resulting product to the Supplier as it so directs;
(e) the Customer irrevocably authorizes the Supplier to enter any premises where the Supplier believes the goods are kept and recover possession of
the goods;
(f) the Supplier may recover possession of any goods in transit whether or not delivery has occurred;

29 Upon assenting to these terms and conditions in writing the Customer acknowledges and agrees that these terms and conditions constitute a
security agreement for the purposes of the PPSA and creates a security interest in all Goods that have previously been supplied and that will be
supplied in the future by the Supplier to the Customer.
30 The Customer undertakes to:
(a) promptly sign any further documents and/or provide any further information (such information to be complete, accurate and up-to- date in all
respects) which the Supplier may reasonably require to:
(i) register a financing statement or financing change statement in relation to a security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register;

34 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Supplier, the Customer waives their right to receive a verification statement in accordance with section

provisions the PPSA.

any Goods (including, without limitation, any manuals, software forming part of the Goods, documentation, papers, training materials, consultation
materials and documents, information or any other thing) provided to the Customer by or on behalf of the Supplier will remain the property of the
Supplier or, where applicable, its licensors or suppliers (“Intellectual Property”).
37 Upon payment in full for all of the Goods provided pursuant to an Agreement, the Supplier grants the Customer a non-exclusive, royalty free,
perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide licence to use the Intellectual Property in the Goods solely for the Customer’s own internal business purposes.
38 The Customer acknowledges that there is no transfer of title or ownership to the Customer of any Intellectual Property or pursuant to these Terms or
any Agreement.
Invoicing and Payment
39 Unless otherwise specified by the Supplier, all Prices specified in an Agreement exclude any tax, including any Goods and Services Tax within the
meaning of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (“GST”), duty or impost levied in respect of the Goods (other than any tax
assessable on the Supplier’s own income) and which the Customer will pay, in addition to the amounts specified in an Agreement.
40 The Price for Goods will be as set out in the Agreement, or, if not specified, as set out in the Supplier’s list of Prices current as at the date of
delivery.
41 The Price set out in a Quotation will be fixed for the period specified in the Quotation. After that period expires, the price, fees and rates will be the
Supplier’s charges and rates as current from time to time.
42 The Price for the Goods must be paid by the Customer to the Supplier as set out in an Agreement and which may be:
(a) on delivery of the Goods;
(b) before delivery of the Goods;
(c) by way of instalments or progress payments in accordance with the Seller’s payment schedule;
(d) in the absence of any express terms nominated by the Supplier, on receipt of any invoice given to the Customer by the Supplier.
43 Time for payment for the Goods is of the essence.
44 Unless otherwise set out an Agreement, payment may be made by cash, cheque, bank cheque, electronic funds transfer into the Supplier’s
nominated bank account, credit card (plus a surcharge of up to one percent (1%) of the Price), or by any other method as agreed to between the
Supplier and the Customer.
45 Receipt by the Supplier of any form of payment other than cash shall not be deemed to be payment until that form of payment has been honoured,
cleared or recognized.
46 Invoices will be expressed in Australian dollars and the Customer must pay the Supplier in Australian Dollars unless agreed in writing to the contrary
by the parties.
47 If the Supplier does not receive payment by the due date, then without prejudice to its rights under these Terms or generally:
(a) the Customer must pay to the Supplier liquidated damages at a rate equivalent to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate of interest for the time being
fixed under Section 2 of the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic.); and
(b) the Customer is liable for, and will indemnify the Supplier in respect of, all reasonable expenses (including expenses such as debt collection
commission and bank charges) and legal costs (on an indemnity basis) incurred by the Supplier in the enforcement of the Customer’s obligations, and
the recovery of monies or other things due from the Customer to the Supplier; and
(c) the Supplier may, by written notice to the Customer, suspend or cease supply of Goods, whether under a particular Agreement or generally until the
Customer has paid all outstanding amounts.
48 If, in the opinion of the Supplier, the Customer has failed to make or unreasonably delayed any payment to the Supplier, the Supplier may revoke or
withdraw any previous approval to extend credit to the Customer, and may require the Customer to make a payment on account of, or in anticipation of,
fees and other amounts to be invoiced pursuant to any Agreement. In that event, the Supplier may by written notice to the Customer, suspend or cease
supply of Goods, whether under a particular Agreement or generally until the Customer has paid all outstanding amounts.
49 The Customer agrees to make payment for any invoices whether Goods are used by the Customer or not.
50 The Customer shall not be entitled to set off against, or deduct from the invoiced price, any sums owed or claimed to be owed to the Customer by the
Supplier nor to withhold payment of any invoice because part of that invoice is in dispute.
51 The Supplier is entitled to set-off against any money owing to the Customer amounts owed to the Supplier by the Customer on any account
whatsoever.
Warranties and liability
52 Subject to clause 54(a), the Supplier warrants that:
(a) the Supplier has the right to supply the Goods under these Terms and the Agreement;
(b) where services are provided, they will be provided with due skill and care;
(c) it is entitled to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under any Agreement and all necessary corporate and other action has been taken to
authorise that execution, delivery and performance;
(d) it holds all licenses required or necessary to lawfully comply with any Agreement; 53 The Customer acknowledges that it has relied on its own
enquires in respect of all matters relating to Goods or an Agreement and has not relied on any representation, warranty, condition or statement made by
or on behalf of the Supplier or any other party other than as set out in an Agreement.
54 Except for express undertakings to indemnify and any warranties set out in an Agreement, to the extent permitted by the law:
(a) the Supplier expressly excludes all conditions and warranties whether express or implied, statutory or otherwise.
(b) the Supplier does not represent or warrant that the Goods or their use will meet the Customer’s requirements.
(c) the Supplier makes no representation or warranty as the quality or suitability of the
Goods
55 Unless otherwise provided in these Terms, in no event will either party be liable to the other party or to any third party for any indirect, punitive,
special, incidental or consequential damage in connection with or arising out of these Terms, an Agreement or the supply of Goods (including for loss of
profits, use, data, or other economic advantage), regardless of how it arises, whether for breach of these Terms or the Agreement or in tort, and even if
a party has been previously advised of the possibility of such damage
56 In no event will the Supplier’s total aggregate liability in respect of all claims arising under or in connection with the supply of Goods or an Agreement
exceed the amount paid to The Supplier by the Customer for the Goods or under the Agreement respectively regardless of whether such claims arise
out of a single event or a series of events.
57 The Customer will not be entitled to exercise any right to reject the Goods or any part thereof because of breach of any condition or warranty unless
the Customer gives the Supplier written notice of such rejection or claim within 14 days of the delivery or collection of the Goods or where the Goods are
installed by the Supplier, within 14 days of installation.
58 In the case of the supply by the Supplier of used or second-hand Goods, the Customer acknowledges that it has had full opportunity to inspect the
such Goods prior to delivery and accepts them with all faults and that to the extent permitted by law no warranty is given by the Supplier as to the quality
or suitability for any purpose and any implied warranty, statutory or otherwise, is expressly excluded. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the
Supplier has agreed to provide the Supplier with the used or second-hand Goods and calculated the Price of the second hand Goods in reliance of this
clause.
59 Nothing in clauses 52 to 58 excludes, restricts or modifies:
(a) the application of any consumer guarantee in the Australian Consumer law, if applicable;
(b) the exercise of any right conferred by a Consumer Guarantee, if applicable; or
(c) the Supplier’s liability under any Consumer Guarantee, if any.
60 To the full extent permitted by law, the Supplier’s liability for breach of any condition of warranty is limited, at the Supplier’s option, to:
(a) in the case of goods, the repair or replacement of those goods, the supply of equivalent goods, the payment of the cost of repairing or replacing the
goods or acquiring equivalent goods; and
(b) in the case of services, supplying those services again, or paying the cost of having the services supplied again.
Termination
61 Either party may terminate an Agreement by written notice to the other party if the other party:
(a) breaches an Agreement, including these Terms if:
(i) the breach is a material breach and is not capable of remedy; or
(ii) the breach is capable of remedy and the other party does not remedy that breach within 14 days of written notice by the terminating party;
(b) becomes subject to an Insolvency Event;
(c) being a partnership, dissolves, threatens or resolves to dissolve or is in jeopardy of dissolving; or
(d) ceases or threatens to cease conducting its business in the normal manner.
62 If the Supplier gives the Customer a notice under clause 61 then, without limiting the Supplier’s rights in respect of that termination:
(a) all sums then outstanding will become immediately due and payable to the Supplier;
(b) the Supplier may, in addition to terminating these Terms or Agreements:
(i) repossess any Goods in the Customer’s possession or control for which payment has not been made in full;
(ii) retain any moneys paid by or on behalf of the Customer to cover payments not yet made by the Customer;
(iii) recover from the Customer (and the Customer shall pay the Supplier) an amount calculated in accordance with clause 64;
(iv) be regarded as discharged from any further obligations under the relevant Agreement or Agreements; and
(v) pursue any additional or alternative remedies provided by law.
63 Any moneys paid or payable to the Supplier pursuant to these Terms or an Agreement are not refundable on termination of any Agreement or
Agreements unless they relate to an overpayment of Goods not received by the Customer following a termination by the Customer pursuant to clause
61 in which case they must be immediately paid by the Supplier to the Customer.
64 If an Agreement is terminated by the Supplier pursuant to clause 61 or if the Customer wrongfully cancels an Order or repudiates an Agreement and
such repudiation is accepted by the Supplier, the Customer shall, without limiting any other rights at law of the Supplier, pay damages to the Supplier
which may as a minimum include:
(a) any loss incurred by the Supplier on returning Goods to the person which supplied the goods to the Supplier;
(b) any costs, charges, fees, losses, penalties, interest and claims for which the Supplier is liable to pay to the person which supplied the Goods to the
Supplier due to non-payment or late payment to that person;
(c) any loss incurred by the Supplier on re-sale of the Goods;
(d) storage costs;
(e) insurance costs;
(f) transport, shipping and delivery costs;
(g) charges for services which the Supplier would otherwise have been expected to have received from the Customer;
(h) any fees and charges for Goods supplied by or on behalf of the Supplier for which the Supplier has not previously rendered an invoice; and
(i) interest on such amounts at at a rate equivalent to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate of interest for the time being fixed under Section 2 of the
Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic.), and the Supplier will be entitled to retain any deposit paid by the Customer to the Seller. The Customer
acknowledges and agrees that these amounts do not constitute a penalty but represent reasonable and genuine pre-estimates of the losses that the
Supplier may incur from such termination, cancellation or repudiation.
65 Termination or expiry of any Agreement or Agreements is without prejudice to any rights or liabilities which have accrued prior to termination.
Force Majeure
66 Neither party will be liable to the other or to any third party for any non-performance or delay in the performance of its obligations under an
Agreement, if a Force Majeure causes the non-performance or delay. In no event will this provision affect Customer’s obligation to make any payments
to the Supplier except in respect of Goods that the Supplier is unable to provide, until they can be provided.
67 If a Force Majeure delays or prevents a party from performing its obligations under an Agreement for a period exceeding 60 days, either party may
immediately terminate that Agreement by written notice to the other party.
Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act)
68 To enable the Supplier to assess any application by the Customer for credit, the Customer authorizes the Supplier to:
(a) obtain from a credit reporting agency a consumer or commercial credit report containing personal information about the Customer and any
guarantors pursuant to Section 18K(1) of the Privacy Act;
(b) obtain a report from a credit reporting agency and other information in relation to the Customer’s commercial credit activities, and
(c) give to a credit reporting agency information including identity particulars and application details.
69 In accordance with section 18N(1) of the Privacy Act the Customer authorizes the Supplier to give to and obtain from any credit provider named in
the accompanying credit application and credit providers that may be named in a credit report issued by a credit reporting agency information about the
Customer’s credit arrangements. The Customer understands that this information can include any information about its credit worthiness, credit
standing, credit history or credit capacity that credit providers are allowed to give or receive from each other under the Privacy Act.
70 The Customer understands that information can be used for the purposes of assessing its application for credit (section 18L(4) Privacy Act), assisting
it to avoid defaulting on its credit obligations, assessing its credit worthiness and notifying other credit providers and credit reporting agencies of a
default by it under these Terms.
