Governing Law; Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH MONEYTREE AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
You and Moneytree agree to submit any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Site to final and binding confidential arbitration, except that you and Moneytree are not required to arbitrate: (i) any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, and (ii) any claim within the jurisdictional limits of small claims court, provided that you or Moneytree bring such claim in small claims court. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
You and Moneytree agree that any arbitration will occur in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. and that the selection of the arbitrator shall be made by mutual agreement of you and Moneytree. If you and Moneytree are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, an arbitrator shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington. You and Moneytree also agree that the state or federal courts in King County, Washington, U.S.A. have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND MONEYTREE WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
Miscellaneous
Currency and Interest Rates. All references in the Site to currency are to the lawful money of the United States, unless expressly stated otherwise. Interest rates indicated on the Site are subject to change without prior notice.
Amendments. We may amend these Terms by providing you with notice of any such amendments. We will provide you with notice by posting the amended Terms to the Site and by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. In our sole discretion, we may also provide you with more prominent notice of any amendments, such as via the homepage of our Site or via email. If you find any amended Terms unacceptable at any time, you must discontinue your use of the Site. By continuing to access or otherwise use the Site after any amended Terms have been posted to the Site, you agree to be bound by such amended Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, any amendment to these Terms will apply prospectively only. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULARLY REVIEWING THE SITE TO OBTAIN TIMELY NOTICE OF SUCH AMENDMENTS.
Termination. Moneytree reserves the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Site, and to block or prevent your future access to, and use of, the Site. Moneytree also reserves the right to terminate in our sole discretion any feature or functionality of the Site without notice to you. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms to the contrary, the following provisions, and all other provisions necessary for their interpretation or enforcement, will survive indefinitely after the termination of this agreement and remain in full force and effect and be binding upon the parties as applicable: Copyright, Trademarks and Limited License; Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability; Governing Law, as well as this provision (Termination).
Assignment and Transfer. We may assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of our rights and obligations under these Terms or any additional terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Site to any third party without the prior written consent of Moneytree. Also, these Terms are solely for your benefit and those of any Moneytree Party, and not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors or assigns.
Waiver and Severability. If we fail to assert or waive any term or condition of these Terms, that action may not be interpreted as a further or continuing waiver of the same term or condition or any other term or condition in the future. Similarly, if any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be deleted or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the contract will continue in full force and effect.
Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Site, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral.
