The goal is to provide the poor, unbanked and underbanked with access to cash, according to a Finextra report.Among the approaches being piloted, are 'banking hubs' in dedicated retail spaces that can combine cash-transaction facilities like those found in a post office, with access to community banking services offered by street retailers. In one community, a financial hub space will be set up in a local church and offer support from major banks, advice on curbing debt and support for financial issues.Existing post office branches within the communities will be restructured and refurbished, and cash services streamlined to make it easier to withdraw and deposit cash quickly and safely. And pop-up post offices will give small communities access to basic banking services over a counter in an existing small shop.There is also a focus to increase the number of businesses offering cashback, in some cases, without requiring people to make purchases."The rapid switch to digital is threatening the viability of today's cash infrastructure. This can lead to consumers left without cash access or forced to leave their own village or town to get cash elsewhere, often at significant inconvenience and cost," Natalie Ceeney, chairperson for the Community Access to Cash pilot program, told the news outlet. "It's critical that we find ways to protect the viability of cash, for consumers and communities alike. These pilots are designed to find sustainable ways to keep cash viable locally, which, if successful, can then be rolled out more widely."The government has already committed to legislate to protect cash, and the financial services regulators are working closely with banks to identify practical next steps.KEEP UP WITH ATM AND DIGITAL BANKING NEWS AND TRENDSSign up now for the ATM Marketplace newsletter and get the top stories delivered straight to your inbox.SUBSCRIBE NOWPrivacy PolicyTOP STORIESThe role of local payments in higher educationInvestment groups seek to acquire CardtronicsATM.TV partners with FCTI for 7-Eleven ATM advertisingInteractive Customer Experience (ICX) SummitJune 2-4, 2021 | Columbus, OHICX Summit 2020 Sponsor: g2o3 reasons to attend the ICX SummitOverviewAgendaSpeakersSponsorsVenueRegisterNewsAlabama-based CB&S Bank becomes the 500th financial institution enrolled in ZelleVerizon, Fiserv partner to offer touchless payment capabilityInvestment groups seek to acquire CardtronicsATM.TV partners with FCTI for 7-Eleven ATM advertisingBitcoin of America installs its 500th US bitcoin ATMSocGen to close 600 branches and cut costs by $546MAnti-money laundering certificate for fintechsMore NewsResourcesIntegrating Document Readers into Kiosks for Secure User IdentificationKey-less ATM & Branch Access Management: How two global banks uncovered hidden costs and established a business case for changeCellular Networks Driving New Retail Business ModelsModern Cash Management: 5 challenges for cash monitoring and forecasting software solutionsWhy video surveillance of ATMs is necessary not only for the bank's security serviceMore ResourcesTrendingInvestment groups seek to acquire CardtronicsSocGen to close 600 branches and cut costs by $546MBitcoin of America installs its 500th US bitcoin ATMATMs in 2021: Change is on the horizonBuying a bitcoin ATM: Advice from an insiderPremium ContentCustomer Experience 4.0 Master Series: Transforming The Future of Retail Banking [$399]2019 ATM Comparison Guide [$349.00$249.00]2019 ATM Future Trends Report [$497.00$399.00]Strategic PartnersAbout Us | Contact Us | Advertise | Editorial Policy | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Service | Site Map | RssUse of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms Of Service and Privacy Policy.
