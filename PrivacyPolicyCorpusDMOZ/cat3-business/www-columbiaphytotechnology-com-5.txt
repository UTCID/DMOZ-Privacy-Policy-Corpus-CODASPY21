OverviewOnline CompendiumAbout the Compendium
Sustaining nature is more than just what we do; it's who we are.
We retain the true taste, wholesome nutrition, and vibrant color of fresh food in authentic, natural food powders.
We protect the integrity of real food over time with INFIDRI™, a gentle drying technology that simply removes water to extend the shelf life of fresh ingredients.
We conserve the environment by conducting our business with responsible and energy-efficient practices.
At POWDERPURE, we believe in sustaining people, fresh ingredients, and the environment through natural food powders we can share with the world.

Real food, simplified.
Our business is built on the belief that there is goodness in simplicity. POWDERPURE began in the 1990s when our founders developed INFIDRI™, a gentle infrared drying technology, to simplify produce into a convenient, powdered form.
This patented technology utilizes targeted wavelengths of infrared light that resonate with molecules of water to remove only moisture, retaining the delicate, beneficial compounds in food without the need for fillers or carriers. INFIDRI™ extends freshness while keeping our products as close to nature as possible.
Unlike traditional drying methods, INFIDRI™ does not rely on intense heat or vacuum pressure to remove water. While these harsh conditions damage fragile nutrient and color compounds, our gentle technology keeps these molecules intact.
Today, we use INFIDRI™ in our state-of-the-art facility in The Dalles, Oregon to simplify real food of all kinds into pure powders that sustain the very best nature has to offer.

Sourcing
We strive to source locally in the Pacific Northwest and California to obtain the freshest produce possible. For those products not abundantly available regionally, our long-standing partnerships with trusted farmers in other regions ensure consistent supply.
Quality
Implementing the strictest controls, our quality programs effectively manage both incoming and outgoing materials in accordance with SQF, a global food safety scheme. Through traceability, monitoring and testing, our products are food safe and supported by robust certifications meeting any non-GMO, Organic and Kosher requirements.
Sustainability
Inspired by our regions’ dedication to clean energy, we’ve partnered with local hydroelectric and wind energy pioneers to power our POWDERPURE facility.
By dehydrating agricultural and food processing side streams with INFIDRI™, we are able to create nutritious, value-added food ingredients that reduce food waste.
