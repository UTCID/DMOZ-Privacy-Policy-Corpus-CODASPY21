Privacy Statement Overview
AmerisourceBergen values and protects the personal information entrusted to the company by its suppliers, customers, and visitors. As a United States company doing business around the world, AmerisourceBergen maintains a comprehensive privacy program designed to comply with its legal obligations under applicable law.

California Supplement. This supplemental notice adds to (and, in some cases, alters) the Privacy Statement with respect to users residing in California and Nevada.
Cookie Policy. This policy explains AmerisourceBergen’s use of cookies, web beacons, and related technologies.
