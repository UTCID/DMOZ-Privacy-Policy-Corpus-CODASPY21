LCM Systems Privacy Policy
LCM Systems is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated or used when you register on our website.
Credit Card Payments:
When providing credit card information by telephone, as soon as the payment has been processed all card details are shredded and disposed of via a data disposal company.
A record of the transaction is held with the company's credit card payment software (Sage Pay) for tax purposes and if a refund is required. This software is security protected and PCI compliant. It is also restricted to key personnel who have been approved and trained in the use of this software.
Online Transactions:
When making a purchase from us via our website, we will collect the information needed to fulfil the order and to notify you of your order status. This will include your name, address, telephone number and email address, along with your credit card details for payment purposes.
Your contact and address details will be held within our accounting software (Sage) for tax purposes and so we can easily process subsequent orders, but credit card details and transactions will be processed separately via our online credit card payment software (Sage Pay), which complies to the highest level (PCI DSS Level 1) of the Payment Card Industry Data Standards. This software is security protected and only accessed by key personnel who have been approved to use this software.
Mailing Lists:
If you choose to register for our e-newsletter, we will save your name and address details and send you updates periodically. We will not pass on this information about you to any other person or organisation. We also provide mailing list members the opportunity to opt out of a mailing list at any point. Just reply to one of our newsletters by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link.
