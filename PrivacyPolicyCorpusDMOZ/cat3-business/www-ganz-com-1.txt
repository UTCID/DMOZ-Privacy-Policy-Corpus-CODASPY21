When you complete the new account application, you will be asked for your shipping and billing address, contact email address, business and bank related information. Once the Account is approved, we will invite you to make up a password and activate your Account online.
Security of Your Account
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU REMEMBER YOUR ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD AND THAT YOU KEEP YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD IN A SAFE PLACE OFFLINE.We will use your username and password to identify you when you log into the Website. If you forget your username or password, you will not be able to access Customer Materials or make purchases through your Account.You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account username and password, and for all activities associated with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify Ganz of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you log out of your Account at the end of each session. Ganz will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.
We have put physical, electronic and managerial procedures into place in order to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use and/or disclosure of personal information. Although we use reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of personally identifiable information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personally identifiable information stored on our servers or the servers of third parties that we use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made via email are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to interception during transmission.
Ganz reserves the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable, to ensure the security of the Website and your Account, including without limitation, terminating your Account, changing your password or requesting information to authorize transactions on your Account. Notwithstanding the above, Ganz may rely on the authority of anyone accessing your Account or using your password and in no event will Ganz be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction of Ganz under this provision, (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your Account or password, and (iii) any unauthorized access to your Account or use of your password.
Submission and Acceptance of Orders
All information on this Website about the goods available for sale (“Goods”) is purely an invitation for you to order Goods and does not constitute an offer to sell such Goods by Ganz. To submit an offer to purchase Goods, correctly and fully complete the order form (“Order Information”) and press the “Complete Order” button on the order page. Unless Ganz agreed to other payment terms, payment for all Goods must be made with a valid credit card from the accepted credit card list identified at the checkout point. By submitting an order payable by a credit card, you will be confirming that you are an authorized user of the credit card.
We will send you an order confirmation e-mail once you complete your purchase. A shipping confirmation e-mail will be sent once your order ships. Your credit card will be charged once the Goods you purchased have been shipped. When more than one item is requested on your order, we will charge your card for each item as it ships via UPS ground service. Since shipping times vary by item, your credit card statement may reflect individual charges for each item as they are shipped. Before your credit card is charged, an authorization will be obtained for the amount of your order. For items with extended shipping time, your credit card may be re-authorized and funds will continue to be set aside (by your bank) for the remaining balance of your order - until Ganz charges your card upon shipment of the Goods. All credit cards must be valid, authentic and you must be authorized to use them. If the charge is not authorized or accepted, we reserve the right to cancel your order without notice and with no further liability or obligation to you. We reserve the right to stop accepting credit cards from one or more issuers at any time.
Your order will be deemed to be accepted once Ganz: (i) receives confirmation of payment in full from the payment processor of your credit card and, (ii) depending on the nature of the order, sends you the Goods. In the case of any customized Goods (e.g. t-shirts with custom slogans), your order will not be accepted and your credit card will not be processed until the requested custom design is approved by Ganz in its sole discretion. If the requested custom design is not approved, you will be notified and provided with an opportunity to revise or cancel your order.
Your orders are processed electronically. Ganz does not offer special handling of orders. Once a product is released to the delivery agent, you will receive a shipping confirmation e-mail with updated tracking information (if available) including an estimated date of delivery. Orders cannot be cancelled or changed through the Website if the Goods have already been shipped.
We rely on the ordering information that you provide to us through this Website as being true, accurate, current and complete. You shall be responsible for any and all losses, damages, and additional costs and expenses that you, we or any other person may incur as a result of your submission of any false, incorrect or incomplete information or your failure to update such information in a timely manner.
At any time, you can log into and check your Account balance and purchase more Goods.
Delivery
Title and risk of loss for all Goods you order shall pass to you upon Ganz’s shipment of the Goods to the shipping carrier. Ganz will not be responsible for lost, stolen, delayed or diverted orders due to factors beyond Ganz’s control.
Refunds, Corrections, and Final Orders
If we send or provide you with the Goods that do not correspond to the items identified in the submitted order form, please contact Ganz and we will make arrangements to correct the order.
In all other instances, once an order is accepted, including when customized Goods are approved, by Ganz, no returns, refunds, exchanges, substitutions or cancellations are permitted except as required under applicable law. Customized Goods may not be returned or exchanged unless damaged or defective.
While every effort is made to ensure that descriptions of Goods and prices are accurate, occasionally errors do occur. Ganz (a) reserves the right to change the Goods advertised or offered for sale through this Website, the prices or specifications of such Goods, and any promotional offers and any other Customer Materials at any time and from time to time without any notice or liability to you or any other person, prior to accepting an order already placed; (b) cannot guarantee that Goods advertised or offered for sale on this Website will be available when ordered or thereafter; (c) reserve the right to limit quantities sold or made available for sale; (d) does not warrant that the Ganz Materials (including without limitation product descriptions or photographs) are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free; and (e) reserves the right to cancel, terminate or not to process orders (including accepted orders) where the price or other material information on this Website is inaccurate. If we do not process an order for such reason, we will advise you that the order has been cancelled and will either not charge you or will apply credit to the payment type used in the order. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusions and disclaimers of certain implied warranties, so some of the provisions of this section may not apply to you.
Termination
Ganz may terminate or suspend your Account and/or access to all or part of this Website and/or any Goods available through this Website in the event Ganz (i) determines after reasonable investigation that you have breached this Agreement or that your conduct violates applicable laws or is otherwise harmful to the interests of Ganz or third parties, or (ii) ceases its operations and/or provision of products or services in connection with this Website.
