Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 24, 2018
The Adhesive and Sealant Council, Inc. (ASC) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the information you provide to us. The information below summarizes our privacy policy.
Information ASC Collects
Mailing Lists
ASC collects and utilizes different kinds of information voluntarily disclosed to ASC either online or in writing through publication order forms, meeting registration forms, surveys, and relevant emails to enable the processing of the order or registration. This information usually includes your name, title, mailing address, phone number and/or email address.
We use personal information provided to improve the services we offer. This information is kept confidential by ASC and is used for internal purposes. We do not sell our email lists to third parties.
We use a third party provider, YourMembership, to deliver our bulk email communications. We gather statistics on email open rates using industry standards to help us monitor engagement with those to whom we email and improve our communications. For more information please see https://www.ascouncil.org/ams/legal-privacy.htm.
ASC Training Academy-related bulk emails are sent to members and customers via third party provider LogMeIn. Their privacy policy may be found here: https://www.logmeininc.com/legal/overview.
ASC utilizes SurveyMonkey to conduct surveys, such as to gauge attendee satisfaction with ASC events, as well as membership ballots, such as to vote on ASC Board candidates and bylaw changes. Their privacy policy may be found here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/?ut_source=footer.

If you pay for registrations and/or products with a credit card, we collect your credit card number (employing industry standard security and encryption technologies), billing information and e-mail address to process your payment.
How ASC Uses Your Information

•	Other organizations with whom we work to create the ASC EXPO and our other events.
We hold our vendors and partners to the same high level of data privacy standards that we use internally. ASC never sells your personal information to any organization, and our vendors and partners are required to hold your information confidential and for ASC-contracted purposes only.
