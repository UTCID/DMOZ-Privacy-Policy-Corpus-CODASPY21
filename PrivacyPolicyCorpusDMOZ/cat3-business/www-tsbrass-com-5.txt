Buy American Act
The Buy American Act is a complex government regulation which could require legal assistance to understand fully. The simplest answer is that, in order to participate in a government or public works project, the materials and finished goods you source must be manufactured in the U.S. or, if the dollar value of the contract is high enough, one of 70+ foreign countries with which the U.S. has a trade agreement.

CA Prop 65 Warning
What is this warning label?
The label is a warning being provided by T&S Brass to comply with the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, commonly known as "Proposition 65." Many products sold in California are required by law to carry the label. The following example label will appear on all T&S products.
Attention California Residents:
"WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals including Lead, Chromium (hexavalent compounds) and Phthalates (DEHP) which are known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."
We are providing Prop 65 warning labels simply to inform consumers that the product contains chemicals on the State of California’s Prop 65 list. T&S Brass products that carry the Prop 65 label include components made with brass, which contains small but detectable amounts of lead—an element included on the Prop 65 chemical list. Brass has a decades-long history of successful use in plumbing applications.
Even though a product may be found to contain a Proposition 65-listed chemical, it does not mean that use of the product will cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. Nor does it mean that a product is unsafe.
All T&S Brass products meet or exceed the requirements of applicable product performance and safety industry standards, as well as the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
We are confident there is no health hazard associated with the installation or removal of T&S Brass products.
What is California Proposition 65?
In 1986, California voters approved the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (known as “Proposition 65”). Proposition 65 is a "Right to Know" statute; its purpose is to make sure people are aware, before they purchase, that the product they come into contact with contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. The statute requires a warning label even if the amount of the chemical is miniscule.
The State of California has listed over
900 chemicals
that must be disclosed under Prop 65. The list, which is updated annually, includes a wide variety of chemicals that can be found in many consumer products, such as kitchen utensils, footwear and handbags, exercise equipment, photo and scrapbook albums, luggage, and many other products (even foods and beverages).
Where can I find out more information about Proposition 65?
The State of California provides Proposition 65 information on the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
website.
Why does T&S Brass include this warning on its products?
We are providing Prop 65 warning labels to inform consumers that the product contains chemicals on the State of California’s Prop 65 list. It does not mean that a product is unsafe. All T&S Brass products meet or exceed the requirements of applicable product performance and safety industry standards, as well as the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The label simply ensures that T&S Brass is in compliance with the State of California’s Prop 65 law for warning label requirements.
Why is this label included on my faucet if I don't live in California?
T&S Brass products are sold nationwide and in Canada. It would be considerably complex to determine which products will be ultimately sold or brought into California. Therefore, to ensure compliance with Proposition 65 requirements, we have decided to include these labels on applicable products, regardless of where they might be purchased or sold.
