Cancellation/Refund Policy
Unless cancelled as provided below, office agreements entered into with Premier will automatically renew on a continuing basis for the same period of time as the initial term at Premier’s then current list price for the office(s) and/or services. If you have less than 3 offices, you must give written notice 60 days prior to the date your agreement is scheduled to terminate in order to cancel your renewal. If you have 3 offices or more, you must give written notice 90 days prior to the date your agreement is scheduled to terminate in order to cancel your renewal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Premier may terminate any agreement after expiration of the initial term for any reason with 30 days notice to you.
Upon expiration of the initial term, virtual office agreements shall automatically renew upon the same terms and conditions at the then current rates charged by Premier, unless earlier terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days advance written notice prior to the expiration of the then current term. Such notice may only be delivered on the first day of any given month. If such notice is delivered on any other day, it shall be deemed to have been delivered on the first day of the following month.

A printed version of these Term and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Term to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
