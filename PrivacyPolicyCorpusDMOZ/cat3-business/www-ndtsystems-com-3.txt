4. CONFIDENTIALITY:

(a) Subject to Paragraph 10(b) below or as otherwise set forth herein, NDT SYSTEMS warrants that the Products will be free from material defects in material and workmanship and will conform, in all material respects, to the Product specifications stated in such user documentation accompanying the Product.  Any third party components of Products or accessories supplied along with Products are not within the scope of the foregoing warranty and may subject to their respective manufacturer’s warranties. The warranties stated herein do not apply to causes other than normal use, such as accident, fault or negligence by Buyer, operator error or misuse, or causes external to the Products, including, but not limited to, electrical failure, fire or water damage, or exposure to intense heat or cold. This warranty shall extend for a period of one (1) year from the date of shipment of the Products from NDT SYSTEMS to Buyer and shall in no event extend beyond such term.
(b) Buyer shall not, for any reason, ship goods back to NDT SYSTEMS without NDT SYSTEMS’ prior written consent, granted at its sole discretion, and any returned goods must include a copy of such written consent. Buyer must receive prior approval, evidenced by a valid return material authorization (a “RMA”), from NDT SYSTEMS to return any Product, with such approval at NDT SYSTEMS’ sole discretion. The Buyer shall request such prior approval by notifying NDT SYSTEMS by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of any claim of defect attributable to failure to use reasonable care in the manufacture of the instrument within twenty-one (21) days of the discovery of such defect. Defects that are not reasonably detected through visible inspection must be reported to NDT SYSTEMS in writing within ten (10) days after discovery of such defect. Failure to notify NDT SYSTEMS within the time and in the manner specified herein shall constitute a waiver of any such claim of defect or breach of warranty. The final determination of the existence of a defect or breach of this warranty shall be made by NDT SYSTEMS at its sole discretion. This warranty shall extend to the Buyer only, and shall not be assignable or transferable to any other person. If NDT SYSTEMS consents to such request, it will issue Buyer a RMA. No returns will be permitted without a valid RMA or following the foregoing twenty-one (21) day period, unless otherwise authorized in writing by NDT SYSTEMS. Any such returned goods must be new (in-the-box) and received by NDT SYSTEMS within ten (10) days of Buyer’s receipt of an RMA. NDT SYSTEMS reserves the right to inspect the goods at its factory and to refuse at its discretion to accept the return of any item. Within thirty (30) days of NDT SYSTEMS’ acceptance of the return, NDT SYSTEMS will credit the Buyer account. Such credit will be the original price of the Product returned; provided that any item returned for credit as a result of an incorrect purchase without a corrected reorder will be subject to a twenty five percent (25%) restocking charge based on the original domestic or international price of the Product returned. Older items, service parts and discontinued items cannot be returned.
