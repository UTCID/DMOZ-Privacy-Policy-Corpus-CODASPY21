NCS Terms and Conditions
STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS
All purchase orders (“Order”) shall be subject to the following terms and conditions (“Buyer” is National Carwash Solutions, Inc.; “Vendor” and “Goods and services” each are as identified on the face of each Purchase Order).
1. Acceptance and Agreement. Acceptance of Buyer’s offer to purchase the Goods and services hereunder is hereby expressly limited to Vendor’s agreement to the terms and conditions contained herein and on the face of this Order. If Vendor’s quotation, acknowledgment, confirmation, invoice or other form states terms additional to or different from those set forth herein, then those terms are deemed to materially alter Buyer’s offer and this writing shall be deemed objection to and rejection of such additional and/or different terms. No modification or waiver of these terms and conditions shall be effective unless in writing and signed by a Vice President or above (or equivalent) of Buyer. Any of the following acts shall constitute an acceptance of Buyer’s offer to purchase the Goods or services on the terms and conditions contained herein and on the face of this Order: (a) the return of an acknowledgment copy of this Order executed by Vendor; (b) Vendor’s delivery to Buyer of a sales acknowledgment or other writing referencing or acknowledging receipt of the Order or agreeing to the description of the Goods and services and the price, quantity terms and delivery schedule appearing on the face of this Order; or (c) Vendor’s commencement of performance of services or shipment of the Goods. If this Order shall be deemed an acceptance of a prior offer by Vendor, such acceptance is limited to the express terms contained herein and on the face of this Order. Additional or different terms or any attempt by Vendor to vary in any degree any of the terms of this Order shall be deemed material and are objected to and rejected, but this Order shall not operate as a rejection of the Vendor’s offer unless it contains variances in the terms of the description, quantity, price or delivery schedule of the Goods. Buyer may withdraw the Order at any time before it is accepted by Vendor.
2. Pricing, Invoices and Payments. Vendor agrees that the price set forth on the face of this Order is the lowest price offered for the same or like goods for similar or smaller quantities, and except as provided otherwise in these terms such price is the highest price that Buyer will pay. Buyer will be given the benefit of any price reductions prior to shipment that are accorded to the same class of trade. The price set forth on the face of this Order may not be increased without Buyer’s written consent. If no fixed price is specified, then Vendor may not fill this Order at a price higher than Buyer was last quoted in writing or charged without Buyer’s written consent, and Buyer reserves the right to reject price increases by cancelling the remainder of the Order. If the price on the face of this Order is incorrect, then Vendor must immediately notify Buyer before processing this Order. If Vendor processes any part of this Order or delivers any of the Goods, then Vendor waives any right to claim a price different from the price set forth on the face of this Order. Unless specified on the face hereof, all charges for packing, storage, transportation to point of delivery, and all taxes imposed upon or in connection with this sale are included in the purchase price shown on the face of this Order. Vendor agrees to use any tax exemption certificates supplied by Buyer and to make any appropriate application for refund if any exempt tax has been paid. Upon refund, the contract price shall be appropriately adjusted or as applicable the refund shall be paid to Buyer. Amounts due Vendor hereunder shall become payable upon Vendor’s submission of a proper invoice to Buyer with respect to Goods and services delivered and accepted by Buyer hereunder. Vendor shall render an invoice or shipping notice electronically via email or other electronic means and do so within at least 24 hours after shipment if requested by Buyer. Buyer’s Order number, part number and package number shall appear on the invoice and bill of lading. The bill of lading or express receipts must accompany the invoice. Payment terms are net 90 days unless otherwise specified on the face of this Order. All invoices received 90 days after the date of shipment or service will be rejected. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy it may have, Buyer reserves the right to set off at any time any amount owing to it by Vendor against any amount payable by Buyer to Vendor.
3. Packing, Amounts and Changes. The Goods shall be suitably packed and marked so as to comply with the shipping instructions found on the face of this Order, or if no instructions are given, to secure the lowest transportation cost and to comply with the requirements of the common carrier to be used. Each package must contain the following: Buyers Order number, Buyer’s part number, item, quantity, and weight. At any time prior to shipment, Buyer may, by written notice to Vendor (and without notice to Vendor’s sureties or assigneds), make changes in the scope of this Order relating to specifications or descriptions, types, quantities, testing, place of delivery, method of shipping or packing and Buyer’s delivery schedule. If a change causes an increase or decrease in either cost or time required for performance, an equitable adjustment shall be made to the price, delivery schedule or both, and the parties shall modify this Order in writing accordingly, provided that Vendor has made written claim for such adjustment within thirty (30) days of receipt of Buyer’s notice of change. Nothing herein shall excuse Vendor from proceeding with performance of this Order as changed. Buyer’s records will be accepted as final and conclusive with respect to all shipments which are not accompanied by invoices or shipping documents indicating quantities shipped. Shipments must be made in the quantities specified on the face of this Order or as otherwise changed in writing by Buyer, and any over- or undershipments may be rejected by Buyer in its sole discretion.
4. Risk of Loss and Place of Delivery. Vendor shall bear the risk of loss until receipt by Buyer of conforming goods, properly packed, at the delivery point specified by Buyer. If not otherwise stated on the front of this Order, the place for delivery of the Goods shall be Buyer’s place of business as indicated on the front hereof.
5. Inspections and Rejections. Buyer shall have the right to inspect and test all Goods for quality, quantity, conformance and otherwise, and such dealing with the Goods shall not be deemed acceptance thereof. Buyer also reserves the right to inspect and test by its own inspectors all raw materials, work in process, completed materials, jigs, fixtures, etc., at Vendor’s plant. Vendor shall provide necessary facilities therefor at its expense.
6. Vendor shall keep all records of such inspections for three years after completion of this contract. If any Goods delivered are found within a reasonable time not to be in strict conformance with the requirements of this Order in Buyer’s judgment, then Buyer, notwithstanding payment or any prior inspection or test, may reject such Goods or revoke this entire Order, require replacement or correction, and cancel any unshipped portion of this Order, at Vendor’s expense, including transportation. If Vendor fails to timely deliver replacement Goods, Buyer may replace them with goods from a third party and charge Vendor the cost thereof and terminate this Order pursuant to Section 15. In the event Buyer receives Goods whose defects or non- conformity is not apparent on examination, Buyer reserves the right to require replacement (or full refund), as well as payment of damages. Buyer may hold any Goods rejected, pending instructions from Vendor, at Vendor’s risk, or Buyer may return the Goods to Vendor at Vendor’s expense. Any complaint, claim, notice of any defect or notice of breach, whether with respect to quality, quantity, or any other defect or breach, shall be considered to be timely if it is made by Buyer within thirty (30) days after Buyer discovers or learns of the existence thereof.
7. Deliveries. The terms of delivery are as stated on the front of this Order. Time of delivery is of the essence of this Order. Acceptance by Buyer of a late delivery of either the whole or part of the Goods under this Order shall not constitute a waiver of Buyer’s claim for any damages resulting from the late delivery. Moreover, in the event (i) that any of the Goods do not comply with this Order or (ii) of non-delivery or delivery on a date unreasonably later than the date specified herein or (iii) of any other breach by Vendor, Buyer may, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to Buyer, (A) rescind this Order in whole or in part, (B) refuse to accept delivery of all or any part of the Goods and/or (C) return all or any part of the Goods at Vendor’s expense, including, but not limited to, freight charges. If due to delivery delays Buyer finds it necessary to call upon Vendor for premium transportation, the responsibility for the price differential between the specified transportation and the premium transportation shall be paid by Vendor. Goods which are delivered in advance of schedule are delivered at the risk of Vendor and may, at Buyer’s option, be returned at Vendor’s expense for proper delivery and/or have payment therefor withheld by Buyer until the date that the Goods are actually scheduled for delivery.
8. Vendor’s Warranties. In addition to any standard warranties given by Vendor and any other express or implied warranties given by Vendor in connection with the sale of the Goods, Vendor represents, warrants and guarantees as follows: (a) the performance of services and Goods will conform to the specifications, drawings, samples or other description specified by Buyer or, if none are so specified, to Vendor’s standard specifications for such goods, will be new and of merchantable quality and, unless specified to the contrary on the face hereof, will be free from defects in material and workmanship, including latent and patent defects, and will be free of all liens and encumbrances and will conform to any affirmation on their container or label; (b) the Goods are fit for their particular purpose if Vendor knows or should know the purpose for which Buyer intends to use them; (c) the Goods and the production and sale thereof, as well as the use or resale thereof, do not and will not infringe any patent right, trade name, trademark, copyright, patent design, right of privacy, or any other right arising out of or relating to the Goods or constitute the unlawful appropriation of a trade secret; (d) Vendor has good and marketable title to the Goods and the transfer hereof is rightful; (e) Vendor will repair or replace, in its sole discretion and at its expense, any defective Good within one year from the date of installation of Seller’s finished product that incorporates the Good as a part or component thereof; and (f) Vendor’s performance and the Goods will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations, orders and standards, including but not limited to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Opportunity Act, OSHA, MSHA and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
