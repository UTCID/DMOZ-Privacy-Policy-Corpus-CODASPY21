1. Our Commitment To Privacy
C.A. Short Company takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine.  Further information about this program is available at http://www.bbbonline.org.
2. The Information We Collect
We collect and store information you provide through our website. On some pages, you can order products and make requests. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
Your Name
Your Mailing Address
Your Email address
Your Phone number
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order through our website and have the option to send it to a different address, you will need to submit the new shipping address. In this circumstance, the additional types of personal information collected are:
Name of Recipient
Recipient’s Address
Recipient’s Email address
Recipient’s Phone number
3. The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We may also retain your information for as long as needed or to comply with our legal obligations.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.
4. Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, C.A. Short Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do at your own risk.
5. Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13 and our website is only accessible with a username and password.
6. How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
If your company gives you the option, you can access your personally identifiable shipping information online that we collect and maintain. If the "MyInfo" button is present, your shipping information can be viewed. If your company allows you to change your shipping information, you will have the ability to change your information at this time. If the 'MyInfo' button is not present, your shipping information is shown at order entry time. If your company allows you to change your information, you may do so at this time.
If your company doesn't allow shipping information to be changed on the website, please contact your Human Resources Department. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information only by having your Human Resources Department send us a request to have your information changed.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
