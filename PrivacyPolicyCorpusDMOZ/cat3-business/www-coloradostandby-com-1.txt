The hosting servers for Colorado Standby are located in Network Access Corporation's (NAC) data center, one of the largest and most fault tolerant networks in the United States. NAC's connections to Internet backbones are maintained at redundant data centers located in NJ and NYC, connecting directly to most of the major networks including Sprint, UUNET, Cable & Wireless (formerly MCI), PSI, Global Center, Savvis, AOL, Exodus, and many others. The network currently consists of 15 DS3 and OC3 lines. The network infrastructure is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. NAC has made significant investments in equipment from major vendors such as Cisco, Livingston, and 3Com/USR.
With respect to security: We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. We use the Red Hat Linux OS and Apache Server secured with Apache-SSL to protect your billing information. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts information and keeps the data private and confidential between your machine and Colorado Standby. This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet. As a further safeguard, we require your browser only use known good encryption algorithms. Look for two security icons, the "s" after "http" in the address line and the lock in the top menu bar and bottom status bar of your browser in Netscape (or in the bottom status bar only in Internet Explorer).
