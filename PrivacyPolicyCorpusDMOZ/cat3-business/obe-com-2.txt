This Terms of Use is a legally binding agreement between you, any third party to whom you provide or allow access to the Website or who otherwise benefits from your use of the Website (collectively sometimes referred to herein as “you” or “your”), and OBE.

If at any time you do not agree to the Terms, then you are not authorized to access, browse or use the Website and you must discontinue use of the Website immediately. OBE may amend the Terms from time to time without notice to you, other than posting the amended Terms to the Website and changing the version number and date of the Terms of Use which is noted just below the first line of text that is the title of the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the then-current Terms, you must immediately discontinue use of the Website. In addition, use of particular Services or information on the Website may be subject to additional terms and conditions that will be available in connection with such services and information.

General Information
The Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and OBE and govern your use of the Website, superseding any prior proposal, representation, agreement, negotiation, offer, counteroffer, acceptance, understanding, or any contrary terms between you and OBE. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that are applicable to certain services on the Website. The Terms and the Privacy Policy do not alter the terms and conditions of any other written or online agreement between you and OBE. The failure of OBE to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms or this Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Terms of Use shall be found by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity of the remaining Terms. You may not assign the Terms or any of your rights or obligations under the Terms without OBE’s express written consent. The Terms inure to the benefit of OBE’s successors, assigns and licensees. The section titles in this Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
OBE shall be not held liable for any delay or failure in performance of any part of this Terms of Use from any cause beyond our control and without our fault or negligence, such as acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, current laws and regulations and changes thereto, embargoes, epidemics, war, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, power blackouts, volcanic action, other major environmental disturbances, unusually severe weather conditions, acts of hackers and other illegal activities of third parties, inability to secure products or services of other persons or transportation facilities, acts or omissions of transportation or telecommunications common carriers, or acts, omissions, overloading, or slow-downs over the internet or any third party internet service providers.
Except to the extent required by applicable law, you agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Website or the terms and conditions contained in this Terms of Use must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or the claim or cause of action shall be forever barred.
Governing Law and Venue for Resolving Disputes
This Terms of Use shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of Georgia, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law principles. Those who choose to access the Website from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable, including without limitation, all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside (if different from the United States).
BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE: (1) WAIVING CLAIMS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AGAINST OBE BASED ON THE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN; (2) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTING TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA OVER ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS YOU HAVE WITH US; AND (3) SUBMITTING YOURSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTES OR CLAIMS.
Binding Arbitration
Arbitration Procedures. You and OBE agree that, except as provided in Paragraph 4 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this Terms of Use, the Terms or your use of this Website (each a “Claim”), will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of AAA that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “AAA Rules”) and under the terms set forth in this Terms of Use. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Binding Arbitration Section and the AAA Rules, the terms in this Binding Arbitration Section will control and prevail.
Except as otherwise set forth in Paragraph 4 below, you may seek any non-injunctive remedies available to you under state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Terms of Use, (i) you and OBE may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision will be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND OBE WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
Location. The arbitration will be conducted in Fulton County, Georgia, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.
Limitations. You and OBE agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between OBE and you individually. YOU AND OBE AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION WILL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
Arbitration Fees. The party seeking the Claim is responsible for the initial fees to AAA. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules.
Severability. You and OBE agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable, except any portion of Paragraph 4, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the Paragraph will be given full force and effect. If Paragraph 4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither you nor OBE will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim will be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Fulton County, GA and you and OBE agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS TERMS OF USE OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
Modifications to the Website or Services
OBE reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website and/or Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice in our sole discretion. You agree that OBE shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Website and/or Services.
Changes to Terms of Use
As OBE’s business changes from time to time, this Terms of Use is expected to change. OBE reserves the right to amend this Terms of Use at any time as provided herein. You should check the Website frequently to see the current Terms of Use in effect and any changes that may have been made to it. Your use of the Website is subject to this Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in effect at the most recent time of use.
