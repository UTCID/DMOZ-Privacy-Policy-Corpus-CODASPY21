Privacy Policy
The California Consumer Privacy Act: Compulink Healthcare Solutions Privacy Policy
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Ca. Civil Code §§ 1798.100-1798.199, gives California consumers certain privacy rights related to their personal information. These rights are in addition to the privacy rights set forth in Compulink Healthcare Solution’s general consumer Privacy Policy.
The first section of this document describes the rights of California consumers under the CCPA.

To submit a request, email us at marketing@compulinkadvantage.com.
Below is a “Notice of Collection” that sets forth the categories of personal information we collect and how we use this information. The second section of this document sets forth our general consumer Privacy Policy.

General Consumer Privacy Policy
Compulink Healthcare Solutions
Compulink Healthcare Solutions (“Compulink”, “we”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains how we treat personal information we obtain from clients, other authorized users of our products and services, prospective clients, and users of the Compulink Advantage Web site (the “Compulink Site”). This policy is part of the terms and conditions that govern use of the Compulink Site.
We use the Compulink Site to make information, products and services available to a diverse group of people who are interested in Compulink Healthcare Solutions, and its products and services, including present and prospective clients, healthcare IT professionals, investors and members of the general public (collectively, the “Compulink Community”). As used in this Privacy Policy, “you” refers to you as a member of the Compulink Community, whether you are acting on your own behalf or as a representative of another person or entity.
The Information We Obtain
We collect the information we need to provide the Compulink Community with the information, products and services that members of that community request and to update, promote, and distribute our products and services to meet the needs of the Compulink Community as they evolve.
If you request information, products or services from Compulink, we will ask you to provide the information we need to respond to your request. No one is required to provide any information to us at any time. However, if you do not provide us with the information we request, we may be unable to provide you with the information, products or services you have asked for. In other cases, your decision not to provide us with information may preclude your access to certain features and functions of products and services we offer.
We also obtain information through the Compulink Site, by using forms posted on or linked to the site that seek information including your interests and concerns, preferences for products and services, or contact information. We also seek information through email, and in other routine, lawful operations that we conduct in the ordinary course of business operations.
These operations may include the use of common data-gathering functionality, such as cookies and other devices that collect certain standard information generated by Web browsers pertaining to users of the Compulink Site, such as IP addresses, access times, and their experience using one or more web sites operated by or on behalf of Compulink.
Clients and Other Authorized Users
Clients of Compulink products and services may use the sections of the Compulink Site reserved for client use (login required) solely as their respective agreements permit. Other authorized users of information resources available on or through this site may use them solely as and to the extent that have been authorized to do so. We request information from clients and other authorized users to authenticate them and verify their authorized use of the, products, services and other resources we provide.
Promotional Offers
Promotion offers are governed by their terms and conditions. We may request information from those responding to offers to determine eligibility and to process and fulfill eligible responses.
We do not request any patient information through the Compulink Site.
We do not intend the Compulink Site to be used by children under the age of thirteen (13) and we do not knowingly collect or retain any information from them.
How We Use the Information Provided
We use the information we obtain to:
Provide clients and authorized users with products, services and information resources;
Develop new and updated products, services and information resources;
Administer, protect, and manage the Compulink Site, our products, services and information resources; and
Communicate concerning our products, services and information, which includes marketing and promotions, including the processing and where applicable, fulfillment of promotional offers.
These uses may involve disclosure of this information to vendors, technology and marketing partners, resellers and others who assist us in the development, marketing, sales, and support of our products and services. We may use and disclose aggregated, non-personal information derived from our operations for a variety of development, promotional, communications, and other business purposes. If we wish to use your name, likeness, or other personally identifiable information for promotional purposes or corporate communications, we will seek your permission before doing so.
Disclosures of Information
We may disclose certain information we obtain in order to provide certain products, services and information resources and to develop, promote, and support our products and services, solely as our agreements with our clients, other authorized users, vendors, technology partners, marketing partners and others permit. In order to ensure continuity of the Compulink Site and the integrity and availability of the information required to provide it and our products and services, information provided to us may be backed up or archived, and this may include the storage of information at facilities operated by our vendors. Finally, we may disclose information as we believe necessary to: (a) comply with applicable law and regulations, which may include disclosures made in response to any subpoena, document request, or other legal request seeking the disclosure of information that appears to have been lawfully issued; (b) perform under and enforce the terms and conditions under which our products and services are provided; and (c) exercise Compulink’s legal rights in its products, services and resources and to otherwise protect its assets. The information we obtain in connection with the Compulink Site is not sold, rented, or otherwise disclosed to any person or entity except as this policy states.
