Investor Relations and Related Matters
Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information
The Websites may contain "forward-looking information" (as defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation) that is based on expectations, assumptions, estimates, projections and other factors that management believes to be relevant as of the date of the content published on the Websites. Often, but not always, such forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "plans", "expects", "is expected", "budget", "scheduled", "targeted", "estimates", "forecasts", "intends", "anticipates", "believes", or variations or the negatives of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved or not be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking information, by its nature, requires us to make assumptions and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties which may give rise to the possibility that our expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate and that our assumptions may not be correct.
Examples of such forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, factors relating to stock, derivatives and energy exchanges and clearing houses and the business, strategic goals and priorities, market condition, pricing, proposed technology and other initiatives, financial condition, operations and prospects of TMX, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks include: competition from other exchanges or marketplaces, including alternative trading systems and new technologies, on a national and international basis; dependence on the economy of Canada; adverse effects on our results caused by global economic uncertainties; failure to retain and attract qualified personnel; geopolitical and other factors which could cause business interruption; dependence on information technology; vulnerability of our networks and third party service providers to security risks; failure to implement our strategies; regulatory constraints; risks of litigation; dependence on adequate numbers of customers; failure to develop or gain acceptance of new products; currency risk; adverse effect of new business activities; not being able to meet cash requirements because of our holding company structure and restrictions on paying dividends; dependence and restrictions imposed by licenses and other arrangements; dependence of trading operations on a small number of clients; new technologies making it easier to disseminate our information; risks associated with our clearing operations; challenges related to international expansion; restrictions on ownership of TMX shares; inability to protect our intellectual property; dependence on third party suppliers; adverse effect of a systemic market event on our derivatives business; risks associated with the credit of customers; cost structures being largely fixed; risks associated with integrating the operations, systems, and personnel of new acquisitions; and dependence on market activity that cannot be controlled. Actual results and developments are likely to differ, and may differ materially, from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking information contained on the Websites.
Such forward-looking information is based on a number of assumptions which may prove to be incorrect, including, but not limited to, assumptions in connection with the ability of TMX to successfully compete against global and regional marketplaces; business and economic conditions generally; exchange rates (including estimates of the U.S. dollar - Canadian dollar exchange rate), the level of trading and activity on markets, and particularly the level of trading in TMX's key products; the continued availability of financing on appropriate terms for future projects; productivity at TMX, as well as that of TMX's competitors; market competition; research & development activities; the successful introduction of new derivatives and equity products; tax benefits/changes; the impact on TMX and its customers of various regulations; TMX's ongoing relations with its employees; and the extent of any labour, equipment or other disruptions at any of its operations of any significance other than any planned maintenance or similar shutdowns.
While we anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change, we have no intention to update this forward-looking information, except as required by applicable securities law. This forward-looking information should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date on each individual page of content or documents included on the Websites. We have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those current expectations described in forward-looking information. However, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended and that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from current expectations. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect us. A description of the above-mentioned items is contained in our most recent Annual MD&A under the heading Risks and Uncertainties.
Investor Relations information
The information posted to the Investor Relations section of the Websites is maintained by the Chief Financial Officer of TMX Group. All information posted to the Investor Relations section of the Websites was accurate at the time of posting, but may be superseded by subsequent disclosures made by TMX Group. TMX Group does not assume any duty of disclosure beyond that which is required by law.
