We are bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), and this policy explains how we manage your personal information and the safeguards we have in place to protect your information. For the avoidance of doubt, this policy also applies to how we manage the personal information of AFS Licensees and their advisers and representatives, and our employees. We may update this policy from time to time for any reason and without notice, so recommend that you regularly review this policy from the links provided on our website (located at the bottom of each web page). Alternatively, you can contact us to request a copy free of charge.

*Where Netwealth is an administrator for a third party issuer, or where you have asked a third party to send us your personal information, you should read the privacy section of the relevant issuer’s disclosure document and the privacy policies of any third parties involved in that arrangement to understand details about how your personal information will be managed and who you should contact in the first instance

5. Accessing and updating your information
5.1 How you can access your personal information
You can request access to your personal information held by us. In most cases, we will grant you access after receiving sufficient information to verify your identity. Access requests may be made in writing, by email or by telephone using the contact details in the Contact us section below.
We do not charge a fee to you when you request a copy of the personal information held about you and generally will not charge you for the provision of your personal information. However, if the request is likely to take us a longer period of time to produce (i.e. more than 2 hours), we will let you know the charge, so you can choose if you want to go ahead. The fee will be an hourly rate to cover the expense of providing you with the data and you will need to make payment before we start.
Information will generally be provided within 30 days of successful verification of your identity and payment of any charge to provide the information (if applicable).
5.2 Can we refuse to provide you with information?
In some cases, we can refuse to provide you with access to information or provide you with access to only some information. This could occur where the information requested is commercially sensitive, would breach the privacy of another person or where we have another lawful reason to refuse. Where we cannot provide you with information, we will write to you to provide an explanation of our decision.5.3 Updating your information
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant. If you believe your personal information requires updating, you can contact us over the phone or complete the update yourself through our online service or a relevant form.
6. Keeping your information secure
6.1 Protecting your information
We may hold your personal information in secure data centres or paper-based files and have implemented a range of physical and electronic security measures to protect your personal information from misuse, unauthorised access and improper disclosure. We also monitor and maintain our security system to ensure that our online services are secure and your personal information is protected appropriately.
To protect privacy, we encourage you to keep passwords and access codes confidential and secure at all times. This means that you should not disclose your password or access codes to others and should contact us immediately if you believe that your password or access codes may have been disclosed to another person or if you would like to change your password.
6.2 Destroying or de-identifying your information
We try to ensure that we only keep personal information only for the period we need it. When we no longer require your personal information we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the data securely.
We will do whatever possible to securely delete or dispose of any material that is provided to Netwealth and not required for the operation of your account, however there may be circumstances where full deletion/disposal may not be possible such as where data has been automatically saved as a result of the data back-up process.
6.3 Data breach response
In accordance with the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme, established by the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 , organisations with existing personal information security obligations under the Privacy Act must notify any individuals likely to be at risk of serious harm by a data breach. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner must also be notified.
If an unforeseen event were to occur and our data, including client personal information was interfered with our accessed by unauthorised persons, we have in place mechanisms to contain the breach and assess the impact. If your personal information were to be accessed or interfered with by unauthorised persons, we would comply with any applicable legal notifications to notify you.
