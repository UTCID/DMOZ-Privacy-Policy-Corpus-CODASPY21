On-Site Copying
On-site Digital Copying Division
Our On-site Digital Copying Division prepares your subpoenas for records, including the Notice to Consumer (if applicable), and mailings to opposing counsels. Our expert staff serves the subpoena on the location and returns to copy the records. We closely follow your order and provide periodic status reports.
Consider allowing us to assist your office in going digital.  Going green is cost effective and good for the environment.  Your staff will enjoy the additional free space in your office.
Helpful Information
Please provide detailed patient information when requesting medical records if you have access to this information: Social Security Number, Date of Birth and Date of Incident.
If you have date limitations, please be sure to make a notation of this on your request, otherwise we will obtain any and all records.
Please note if you would like diagnostic films, billing records and/or insurance records.
Please designate for large medical centers if you want both the hospital and the clinic records.
On matters involving real estate transactions, the notice to consumer must be sent to all parties involved (buyers/sellers); therefore, please include the names and addresses of all parties to be noticed.
Subpoenas are used to obtain records, rather than authorizations, 20 days after the Summons has been served (CCP 2025)
Records from any Veteran Affairs office requires a signed authorization.
Any request for telephonic records requires a signed authorization by the party of record on the account.
Any mental health records require a special signed authorization which specifically states the release of psychiatric/mental health records.
Any HIV/AIDS treatment related medical records require a special signed authorization which specifically states the release of those records.
If using a medical authorization, please make sure the authorization is dated by the patient within the last 6 months. Make sure the authorization is HIPAA compliant.
