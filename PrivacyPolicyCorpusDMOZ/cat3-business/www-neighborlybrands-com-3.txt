RESPONSIBILITY FOR USER-GENERATED CONTENT POSTED ON OR THROUGH THIS SITE
You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any UGC.
This means that you, not Neighborly, are entirely responsible for all UGC
that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments
that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms
of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If
any part of the UGC you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility
to obtain any necessary permission to post it.
Because we do not control the UGC posted on or through this Site, we cannot
and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability,
or quality of that UGC. You also agree and understand that by accessing
this Site, you may encounter UGC that you may consider to be objectionable.
We have no responsibility for any UGC, including without limitation any
errors or omissions therein. We are not liable for any loss or damage
of any kind you may claim was incurred as a result of the use of any UGC
posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through
this Site. The UGC posted on or through this Site expresses the personal
opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not necessarily reflect
the views of Neighborly or any person or entity associated with Neighborly.
You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it. You own the copyright in any original UGC you post. We do not claim any
copyrights in UGC. However, by using this Site you are granting us and
our subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive,
fully paid, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable
license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees)
to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, publish,
transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and commercialize UGC you post in
any and all media or form of communication whether now existing or hereafter
developed, without obtaining additional consent, without restriction,
notification, or attribution, and without compensating you in any way,
and to authorize others to do the same. For this reason, we ask that you
not post any UGC that you do not wish to license to us, including any
photographs, videos, confidential information, or product ideas.
We may disclose and/or remove User-Generated Content. Neighborly has certain rights. We have the right (but do not assume the
obligation) to:
monitor all UGC;
require that you avoid certain subjects;
remove or block any UGC at any time without notice at our sole and absolute
discretion;
disclose any UGC and the identity of the user who posted it in response
to a subpoena or whenever we believe that disclosure is appropriate to
comply with the law or a court order, to prevent or investigate a possible
crime or other violation of law, to protect the rights of Neighborly or
others, or to enforce these Terms of Use; and
terminate your access to and use of this Site, or to modify, edit or block
your transmissions thereto in our sole discretion.
You agree that our exercise of such discretion shall not render us the
owners of UGC you post, and that you will retain ownership thereof as
described above.
Restrictions on User-Generated Content. It is a condition of these Terms of Use that you do not:
upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available
any UGC that is unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening, abusive, harassing,
libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, racially
disparaging, indecent, or invasive of another’s privacy;
any UGC that constitutes or encourages activity illegal under criminal
or civil law;
any UGC that is false, misleading, or fraudulent;
any UGC that you do not have a right to make available under any law or
under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information
or proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part
of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
any UGC that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including
UGC which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy
rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights, confidentiality rights,
contract rights, or any other rights of any individual, living or deceased,
or any legal entity;
any UGC that contains the image, name or likeness of anyone other than
yourself, unless (i) that person is at least eighteen years old and you
have first obtained his/her express permission or (ii) that person is
under eighteen years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian;
any request for or solicitation of any personal or private information
from any individual;
any request for or solicitation of money, goods, or services for private gain;
any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code,
files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality
of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; or
any UGC that contains advertising, promotions or marketing, or which otherwise
has a commercial purpose;
impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent
your affiliation with a person or entity; or
violate any local, state, national or international law, rule or regulation.
By posting User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that (i) you
own or otherwise control all of the rights to the UGC and have the right
to grant the license set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the UGC is
accurate, and (iii) you have read and understood—and your UGC fully
complies with—these Terms of Use and applicable laws and will not
cause injury to any person or entity.
REMOVAL OF CONTENT
In general. You can seek removal of objectionable UGC by contacting us using the information provided
below. We will review all such requests and will remove UGC that we determine
should be removed, in our sole discretion and in accordance with these
Terms of Use and applicable law. Please be aware, however, that if the
UGC has already been distributed to other websites or published in other
media, we will not be able to recapture and delete it. Also, a back-up
or residual copy of the UGC we remove from this Site may remain on back-up servers.
Violation of copyrights. Neighborly does not knowingly violate or permit others to violate the
copyrights of others. We will promptly remove or disable access to material
that we know is infringing or if we become aware of circumstances from
which infringing activity is apparent.
If you are requesting removal of content because of a violation of your
copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
(the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe
that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law. If you believe that your own work, or the work of a third
party for whom you are authorized to act, is featured on this Site or
has been otherwise copied and made available on this Site in a manner
that constitute copyright infringement, please notify us immediately.
Your notice must be in writing and must include
an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person
authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located
on this Site (including the URL, title and/or item number if applicable,
or other identifying characteristics);
your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and, if you are
not the owner of the copyright, the name of the owner; and
a written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed
use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information
in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized
to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Your statement must be sent to:
copyright@dwyergroup.com
Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on
its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not
be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon
us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material
or acts are evident.
