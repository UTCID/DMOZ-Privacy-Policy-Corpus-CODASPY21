Many businesses experience challenges when looking to secure traditional financing, usually due to tighter credit requirements, reduced liquidity or significant growth. If you're looking to access funds quickly to meet daily business demands, working capital financing may be the solution for you.
We typically serve small to middle market companies with annual revenues of $2 million to $450 million. We can provide the necessary working capital with facility sizes from $200 thousand to $35 million when traditional bank financing is unavailable to meet your needs.
Is accounts receivable financing right for you?
Accounts receivable financing is a flexible option for companies that have significant amounts of day-to-day expenses or require consistent cash flow to maintain quality service. Your working capital can help improve your spending power and enhance your operations management.
