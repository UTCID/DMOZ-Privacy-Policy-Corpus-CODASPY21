Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services in this Web Site at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from this Web Site.

You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.

In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice. We will correct any pricing errors on the Web Site as and when discovered. The Web Site contains a large number of products and services and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products or services listed on the Web Site may be incorrectly priced.

PLACING AN ORDER/ ACCEPTANCE
Please follow the instructions on the Web Site to place your orders. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy the products and services. After receiving an order, we will send you an e-mail acknowledging that we have received your order (“Order Confirmation”).

All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email confirming the shipment of your order (the “Shipping Confirmation”). A contract with us will be formed only when you receive the Shipping Confirmation. The contract will relate only to those products and services whose shipment we have confirmed in the Shipping Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other products or services which may have been part of your order in the same or a separate Order Confirmation. We reserve the right to cancel your order at any time before we have accepted it and we may rescind our acceptance and cancel your order where there has been an obvious error in price or where the products or services are no longer in our inventory.
