International Customs Charges Information
Imports over NZD $199.00 will generally incur customs and import taxes in New Zealand. This also includes separate orders arriving into NZ customs the same day. Billabong has no control over these taxes and cannot advise what they will be once your parcel has arrived in New Zealand. All charges are to be paid by the customer on delivery of order. Orders cannot be returned to sender and Billabong will never pay these customs charges on your behalf. If you refuse to pay these charges your parcel may be abandoned, and Billabong will not be held responsible for any loss of funds as a result of this occurrence. We cannot mark International orders as a gift in order to bypass or reduce any customs fees. This is an illegal practice and as an established business we will not do this.

Packages should be received within 2-3 working days for metro areas, and between 2-5 days for regional areas. Estimated delivery time for bulky orders is 2-7 days and for Regional Areas from 5-10 days. A shipping confirmation email will be sent when your order leaves our warehouse.
Our service is Authority To Leave, so if it is safe to do so, the courier will leave the package in a safe place at your premises. If you do not feel that your package will be safe if left, please contact the customer service team before placing your order so that they can assist you.
