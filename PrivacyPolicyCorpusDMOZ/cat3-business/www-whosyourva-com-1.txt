specifically market to children under 13.Fair Information PracticesThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have

protect personal information.  In order to be in line with FIPP we will take the following responsive action should a data breach occur: We will notify users via email within seven days.We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have the right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.  This

non-compliance by data processors.CAN SPAM ActThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have
