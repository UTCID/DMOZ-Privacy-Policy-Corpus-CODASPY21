CURRENT ALERTS
Real-Time Security and Fraud Alerts
In a time when fraud, scams, and identity theft are a real concern, Harborstone uses the latest security protocols to ensure that your financial transactions and personal data remain confidential. We will keep you updated about the latest scamming tactics to help increase awareness of security issues.
Fraud Alert: Phone Calls Asking for Personal Information
We have received reports of fake phone calls from fraudsters posing as Harborstone employees, asking members to verify or disclose personal sensitive information.
These calls are not legitimate and may even sometimes appear to come from Harborstone. We advise you to never give out your personal information unless you are positive that it’s to a trusted source. If you feel that you may have provided your personal information to these fraudsters or another untrusted source, please call us immediately.
If you receive a phone call that you are suspicious of, please hang up and dial the number to call us at (253) 584-2260 or 1-800-523-3641 to verify the validity of the call.

ACCOUNT PROTECTION
How We Protect Your Account
Our members' account and personal information security is our top priority.
REST ASSURED KNOWING:
You do not need to call us unless you see transactions you do not recognize. We are actively using our fraud-monitoring tools to look for abnormal transactions or spending and ATM patterns—and to help us block these transactions.
We will let you know if we see unusual activity on your account.
We will send you a new card if we determine that to be necessary.
We regularly monitor Harborstone member accounts for unusual activity and encourage you to check your account activity using online, mobile, and telephone banking, as well as text and email alerts.
We will call you to verify transaction information only. If you receive a phone call from someone saying they are from Harborstone and asking for sensitive account information, please hang up and notify us immediately by calling trusted, official Harborstone phone numbers.
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
Continue using your Harborstone card(s).
Make sure that your contact information is updated so that important account information and new debit or ATM cards are not being sent to the wrong address. You'll also want to notify us when you have a change in your phone number or email address. This will allow us to appropriately contact you when necessary.
Switch to eStatements, get email alerts when your statement becomes available, and relax knowing your account information is safe and secure.
Familiarize yourself with Harborstone's online banking security standards.
Regularly check your credit report. You can check your credit easily online, and doing so can help catch signs of identity theft. We recommend using AnnualCreditReport.com or each of the three national credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) once every 12 months.
WHO TO CONTACT:
If you find yourself in one of the following situations, we're here to help. Give us a call.

Identity Theft or Misuse of Your Personal Information
If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Office of the Attorney General in your home state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.
