Privacy PolicySpeak, lead and live with maximum influence.
Individual private speech and presentation skills coaching has been the cornerstone of my work since 2003. The customized nature of the coaching sessions allows us to get to the heart of the obstacles that are holding you back from presenting, communicating and leading with confidence and impact. Through discussion, creative exercises, videotaped simulations, and tried-and-true theater based techniques, you’ll define and embrace your unique Transformational Presence, allowing you speak, lead and live with maximum influence.
Coaching is appropriate for anyone, at any skill level. The only requirement is that you are willing to honor the First of Eleni’s Five Principles of Transformational Presence: Know Thyself. Your willingness to commit to your growth and development in a coaching format is the key to your coaching success.
Coaching is offered in person, by phone, or via SKYPE.
Eleni knows how to empower women, making them feel stronger and giving them the skills they need to succeed in their professional lives. I left her presentation feeling inspired to be the best woman I can be in all aspects of my life.
