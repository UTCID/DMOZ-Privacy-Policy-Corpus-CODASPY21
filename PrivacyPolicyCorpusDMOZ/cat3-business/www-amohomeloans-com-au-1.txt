How can I use equity in my home to help my kids get into property?
Written by AMO Home Loans. Posted in Blog
As parents we know from experience that it can take several years to save up enough money to use as a deposit for your first home. But how can you help your kids to save a deposit so that they can own their own home sooner? Can you help your kids to build a property portfolio without giving away all of your hard earned cash as a "gift"? And what measures can you take to protect yourself?
In this radio interview on 2UE's Talking Lifestyle, Robert Projeski, the Managing Director of AMO talks to parents on the pros and cons of lending money to their kids. He also talks about how parents can tap into the equity in their own home, and suggests some safe options to help their kids get into the property market.
