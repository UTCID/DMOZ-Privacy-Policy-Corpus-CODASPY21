Image-Edit & Art
will not sell, rent or provide your personal information to any third-party, unless
required to do so by judicial order, process or rule, or in the event
Image-Edit & Art
reasonably determines that disclosure is essential to protect itself, its customers
or third-parties from physical or financial harm that may result from unlawful or
dangerous conduct.
Image-Edit & Art
makes reasonable efforts to handle customer images in a manner that avoids access
to them or misuse of them by unauthorized parties. It is impossible for
Image-Edit & Art
to guarantee the security of its system from interference by highly-skilled malicious
hackers. The various steps
Image-Edit & Art
takes to ensure security reflect a commitment to reduce the risk of such a breach
to a very low level.
Image-Edit & Art
reserves the right to terminate the access of any person to the system, with or
without cause.
Image-Edit & Art
will report any unlawful use or abuse of its system to authorities and will prosecute
unlawful conduct (including threats thereof) to the fullest extent of the law.
Access to completed images is limited to our customers through their individual
accounts,
Image-Edit & Art
employees and affiliated creative services providers, and any third-party whose
e-mail address the customer expressly provides. Projects are identified to our service
providers by order number only.
Image-Edit & Art
personnel will not ask for passwords.
Customers provide a password to access their order status and images.
Image-Edit & Art
cannot assure security with respect to persons who have obtained a customer's password
from the customer. Customers are responsible for transactions made with customer's
password, and customers should keep it confidential!
