Privacy Policy
You have our total commitment that all of your personal information, home location and details will remain completely confidential and will not be shared with anyone.
Once your home is built, we sometimes work with a national photographer to take professional photos of the homes for magazine articles, covers, our advertising and website. It is completely up to each homeowner if they want to share their name or the location of their home.
We deeply value the relationships we build with homeowners. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact us at Maple Island Log Homes – 231.821.2151 or email here.
