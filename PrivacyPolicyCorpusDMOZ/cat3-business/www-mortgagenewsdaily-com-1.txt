policies and practices.

through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or emails); and ii) information that is derived through
automated tracking mechanisms.

users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.
Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including
whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the
cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized
access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.

drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly into Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs
to our user's personally identifiable information.
