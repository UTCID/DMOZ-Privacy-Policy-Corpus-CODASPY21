What Our Clients Are Saying
Crystal was a great photographer for our wedding! She's definitely LGBT friendly and has some cool rainbow umbrellas to use as props in your pictures - if that's your style. Our friends and family were all very impressed with the number of photos she took and shared with us - and they're all great shots! We would absolutely recommend her to others. - Kelsey and Shannon - Baltimore, MarylandWhen I got engaged, I knew who I wanted to take our engagement pictures and also photograph our wedding. I contacted Crystal and asked her if she would be willing to come to Gettysburg, PA to take our engagement pictures and she was more than happy to drive 4 1/2 hours to our farm to capture my "farmer fiancé" and I in the cornfield, in our sunflower field and on our combine. On the day she drove up to take our pictures, it was a really hot and humid August day. She walked around the farm with us snapping pictures and was willing to do whatever we wanted. She did an amazing job capturing who we were and was patient with us when we changed outfits. We also hired Crystal to also photograph our wedding the following September. We filled out a questionnaire beforehand so she knew exactly what kinds of pictures we were wanting her to take. A few days before our wedding, she called and made sure everything was on schedule and letting us know what time we would expect her to arrive at the wedding. My fiancé and I did a "First Look" before the wedding and Crystal was so professional and everything went so smoothly. I can't begin to say how satisfied we are with our wedding pictures!! They were absolutely beautiful! She took pictures of all the little detailed things! I would highly recommend Crystal if you are looking for a photographer! - Chrissy and Dave - Gettysburg, PARead more reviews here.
