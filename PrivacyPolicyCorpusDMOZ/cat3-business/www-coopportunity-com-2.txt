TO THE EXTENT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, HELD TO BE INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CO+OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY REASON AND UPON ANY CAUSE OF ACTION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY AND OTHER ACTIONS IN CONTRACT OR TORT) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SITE, THE SERVICES OR THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO YOUR DIRECT DAMAGES NOT TO EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PA Y TO US IN CONN ECTION WITH USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST UNDERLYING ACT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR (B) $500.

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. *If YOU ARE a COMPANY DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA, YOU HEREBY waive California Civil Code Ã‚Â¤1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
14. Indemnity of CO+OPPORTUNITY. You agree to indemnify and hold CO+OPPORTUNITY (including without limitation our agents, employees, officers, directors, subsidiaries, parent and affiliated companies) harmless, and, at CO+OPPORTUNITY’s request, to defend CO+OPPORTUNITY from and against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, loss or liability, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent that such action is based upon, arises out of, or relates to: (i) your use of (or inability to use) any and all of the Services; (ii) your violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (iii) the infringement by you, or any other person using your password and account, of any right of any person or entity; or (iv) any other of your activities relating to your use of this Site and the Services.

This Agreement does not modify, alter or amend any other agreement you have entered or will enter into with CO+OPPORTUNITY or any of its related or affiliated entities. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement, or any supplemental agreement offered as any part of any registration for additional Services on this Site, conflicts with any provision of your other agreements with CO+OPPORTUNITY or any of its related or affiliated entities, the terms of such other agreement, shall, as to the subject matter of that other agreement, take precedence over the conflicting term(s) of this Agreement.
16. Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises out of or relates to the Services or this Agreement or its breach (with the exception of rights to injunctive relief with respect to Intellectual Property Rights and obligations with respect to confidentiality), and the parties have not been successful in resolving the dispute through direct negotiation, then the dispute will be resolved in binding arbitration as follows: (i) the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules; (ii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) the location of the arbitration will be California Site, California or such other location as the parties may mutually agree; and (iv) the parties will have the right to take discovery of the other party by any method allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator(s) will each be a natural person who has never been employed (either as an employee or as an independent consultant) by either of the parties, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, and will be familiar with the business of the parties. The arbitrator(s) may upon request exclude from use in the arbitration proceeding any evidence not made available to the other party pursuant to a proper discovery request. The arbitrator(s) will issue a reasoned award. The cost of the arbitration will be borne equally by the parties pending the award. Upon the decision of the arbitrator(s), the prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the other party its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. You agree that CO+OPPORTUNITY may seek interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction necessary to protect the rights or property of CO+OPPORTUNITY pending the completion of arbitration. The parties, their representatives, other participants, the arbitrator(s) and the administrator(s) of the arbitration will hold in confidence the existence, content and outcome of the arbitration.
17. Choice of Law and Forum. The Services are controlled by CO+OPPORTUNITY from California, U.S., although it may be accessed throughout the world. Subject to Section 15 herein, by accessing or using any or all of the Services, you and CO+OPPORTUNITY each agree that the substantive laws of the State of California will govern with respect to all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement, or the use (or inability to use) any or all of the Services, and that such laws will apply without regard to principles of conflict of laws. Subject to the dispute resolution procedures site forth above, you and CO+OPPORTUNITY agree and hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate State and Federal courts located in Johnson County, California with respect to such matters. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Services must be filed or otherwise commenced within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
18. Miscellaneous Terms. Subject to the terms of Section 15 herein and CO+OPPORTUNITY’s other operating rules and policies for this Site, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CO+OPPORTUNITY with respect to the subject matter addressed herein, and governs your use of any or all of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and CO+OPPORTUNITY relating to such subject matter, but this Agreement may be supplemented by any other agreement you enter into with CO+OPPORTUNITY pursuant to a registration to access certain features of this Site. The failure of CO+OPPORTUNITY to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. The section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
19. Severability of Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the remaining provisions and shall not affect their validity and enforceability.
