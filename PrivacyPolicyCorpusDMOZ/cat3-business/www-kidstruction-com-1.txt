We will help you identify the variables that are unique to your organization and give you guidance to make the best choices possible. Kidstruction™ will help you secure the most equipment and best features for your money, while creating an outdoor playset wonderland that will foster physical, mental, and social skills in a secure environment.
Kidstruction™ Playground Equipment
Search our outdoor playground equipment by either age group or price. If you need equipment for a preschool, for example, there is no sense in looking at playground structures designed for 12-year-olds. By the same token, our equipment for 6 to 23-month-olds would be out of place at a local park or on an elementary school playground. We also know that you most likely have a set budget for your needs, so we want you to have a realistic idea of what you can accomplish in terms of price.
Kidstruction™ commercial playground equipment includes swings, slides, bridges, climbers, play panels, and rooftops—elements that make playtime engaging, stimulating and even inspiring for pint-sized minds with immense imaginations. As your little pirates and princesses bring Kidstruction™ structures to life, rest assured that all components are made from the safest and most durable materials available.
Kidstruction™ Accessories and Added Features
In addition to outdoor playsets, Kidstruction™ offers additional accessories such as free-standing play stations, sun shades, and safety surfacing to complete your playground package. If you need features such as park benches, waste receptacles, or even barbecue grills, Kidstruction™ can bring your vision, in its entirety, to fruition.
Contact Kidstruction™ to begin mapping out your vision for kids playground equipment. We offer both the equipment and the technical expertise to help that vision take shape.
