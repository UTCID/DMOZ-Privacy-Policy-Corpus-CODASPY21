Your Privacy Matters to Us.
At HomeEquity Bank we respect your privacy. Our commitment to safeguarding your privacy is reflected in our Privacy Policy.
In order to provide you with HomeEquity Bank’s products and services, such as the CHIP Home Income Plan, we collect personal information about you. In doing so we adhere to Canada’s federal privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).
PIPEDA’s 10 Fair Information Principles govern how HomeEquity Bank collects, uses, stores and safeguards your personal information. Click here for a quick overview of these principles in our Privacy Brochure. The principles apply to all of our employees, agents and any companies that we may contract with which necessitate handling your personal information. Click here to read how we apply these principles in our day-to-day business.
We’ve developed a series of Q&As to answer common questions. And we’ve also provided you with some information about the National Do Not Call List.
