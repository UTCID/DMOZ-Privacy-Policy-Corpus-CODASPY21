30-DAY UNCONDITIONAL COMFORT GUARANTEE:
If during the first thirty (30) days immediately following your purchase you are not satisfied with the comfort of your Red Wing branded work footwear for whatever reason, Red Wing will refund the purchase price to you, no questions asked, provided you still have your dated receipt of purchase. No adjustment will be given without the original receipt of purchase. You must return your footwear to the Red Wing Shoe dealer from which the footwear was purchased. Limit one return per customer. This guarantee does not apply to WORX, Red Wing Heritage, Irish Setter or Vasque branded footwear.
LIMITED WARRANTY RELATING TO RED WING FOOTWEAR:
Footwear products bearing the “Red Wing” or “Red Wing Shoes” label are warranted against defects in workmanship and materials. If within 12 months of purchase, a defect occurs in a Red Wing branded footwear product as the result of normal use, Red Wing will repair the defect or exchange the product. Product failures caused by excessive or abusive wear conditions do not qualify for exchange or purchase credit. This warranty is available only to the original purchaser and is not transferable. No adjustment will be given without the original receipt of purchase. You must return your footwear to the Red Wing Shoe dealer from which the footwear was purchased.
DISCLAIMER: The limited warranty relating to Red Wing branded footwear is in lieu of any other express warranty. No agent, employee or representative of Red Wing has any authority to bind Red Wing to any affirmation, representation or warranty concerning Red Wing branded footwear products, except as stated herein. Red Wing shall not be liable for any consequential, incidental or punitive damages.
This limited product warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary from state to state. Any implied warranties shall be effective for a period not exceeding 12 months from the date of purchase. Some states do not allow manufacturers to impose time limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
