Mitigating the True Risks of EavesdroppingExperience and Training Sets Us ApartThe Risks of a Potential Eavesdropping Attack are HugeThe risk of potential eavesdropping attacks are huge and not only to corporations and government agencies, but to individuals whether it’s a celebrity, professional athlete, high-profile individual, or anyone who needs to have their privacy protected. Every year, billions of dollars are lost in corporations and businesses to illegal eavesdropping attacks through illegal means by way of electronic surveillance, hacking, internal employee theft, trade secrets and selling of insider information, and the lack of corporations to counter the threat through proactive steps in detecting weaknesses in their overall security programs. Individuals on the other hand are even more susceptible to eavesdropping attacks as they don’t have the resources necessary to stop or detect the threat until in most cases, it’s too late and harm and disclosure have already occurred.Corporate Risks
