Technology companies strive constantly to succeed in fiercely competitive, fast-growing markets. Their work enables companies of all sizes and from every industry and country to reach new markets, create jobs, and raise standards of living around the world. By opening markets, reducing barriers, tackling discriminatory rules and regulations, and injecting more certainty and predictability into the marketplace, international trade and investment agreements are important catalysts for this progress. ITI works closely with governments and other stakeholders to support the negotiation of these agreements, with a focus on promoting the free flow of information across borders, prohibiting requirements calling for the localization of data or hardware, and ensuring that technology goods and services are able to access global markets.
