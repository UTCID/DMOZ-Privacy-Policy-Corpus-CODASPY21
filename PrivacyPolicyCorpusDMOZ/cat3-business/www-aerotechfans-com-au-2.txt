The purchaser may not without the Seller’s consent cancel an order after the Seller has accepted the order. If the Seller consents to the cancellation of an order, the purchaser will be liable for any costs incurred by the Seller up to the time of cancellation. The cancellation charges on completed goods and goods that are made to order will be 100% percent of the selling price of the goods. The  cancellation charges shall not in any way whatsoever limit the Seller’s other remedies it may have at law including the ability of the Seller to claim and recover any Loss to which the Seller would otherwise be entitled by reason of accepted orders being cancelled by the purchaser.
All prices quoted are in Australian dollars and except as otherwise expressly stated, exclusive of insurance, delivery charges, GST and any other sales, value added or similar tax which may apply.
Prices quoted for goods manufactured by the Seller or Services performed by the Seller are subject to acceptance by the purchaser no later than 30 days from the date of the quotation.

the goods are shipped within 12 months of the date of the Seller’s receipt of the purchaser’s order.

Seller delivery: in which case the Seller will deliver the Goods to the delivery destination and the purchaser must execute a proof of delivery document.
The purchaser is deemed to accept delivery of the Goods and risk in the Goods will pass to the purchaser:
in the case of delivery in accordance with clause 3(j)(i), when the Goods are picked up by the purchaser; and

Overdue accounts will bear interest at the prevailing bank rate charged to the Seller and such interest will accrue from the date payment was due to the date payment is made, will be calculated daily and capitalised monthly and must be paid by the purchaser upon demand by the Seller.
No amount owing by the purchaser to the Seller may be offset against any amount owing to the purchaser from the Seller under the Contract or on any other account whatsoever.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
The purchaser is authorised to use the Confidential Information for the sole purpose of using or selling the Goods supplied under the Contract and must not otherwise use or disclose any Confidential Information.
FREIGHT CLAIMS
The Seller will use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Goods for which it has accepted an order by the date (if any) specified in the order and in the absence of any date, within a reasonable time. The failure of the Seller to deliver the Goods by the date specified in the order does not entitle either party to treat an order or the Contract as repudiated
Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, delivery of the product is made FCA (under Incoterms 2010) to the purchaser’s nominated carrier at the Seller’s plant.
If the purchaser has asked the Seller to nominate and arrange a carrier, it does so as agent for the purchaser and the transaction will, notwithstanding the nomination and arrangement of the carrier by the Seller, proceed as FCA (rather than CPT or CIP).
The liability and responsibility of the Seller for the goods ceases upon delivery of the goods to the carrier. All claims for loss, damage or shortage in loading onto the carrier’s vehicle and in transit are the purchaser’s sole responsibility.  To the extent permitted by law, the Seller accepts no responsibility for any liability caused to the goods in loading or transit howsoever arising, including any liability arising out of any negligence on the part of the carrier, and the purchaser hereby agrees that it will not hold the Seller responsible for any costs and expenses whatsoever arising out of or in connection with any loss or damage occurring in loading or transit, or arising out of the loading or transit of the goods (including any loss caused by delay).
The purchaser is responsible for all insurance of the goods in loading and transit and the Seller takes no responsibility for ensuring that such insurance has been arranged prior to delivery of the goods.
Claims for factory shortage will not be recognized unless such alleged shortage is reported to the Seller in writing within 5 days after delivery of the goods.
RETENTION OF TITLE
The property in the goods supplied does not pass to the purchaser until the Seller has received payment for those particular goods and payment in full of all other money owing by the purchaser on any other account, whether or not that account relates to the sale of goods and the purchaser’s cheque has been honoured.
Until full payment in cleared funds is received by the Seller for all Goods supplied by it to the purchaser, the purchaser must, at its own cost, insure and keep insured the Goods against such risks as a prudent owner of the Goods would insure at their full cost price, with a reputable insurance company.
Until full payment in cleared funds is received by the Seller for all Goods supplied by it to the purchaser, as well as all other amounts payable by the purchaser to the Seller on any account whatsoever:
legal title and property in all Goods supplied under the Contract remain vested in the Seller and do not pass to the purchaser;
subject to (iii), the purchaser must keep the Goods separate from other goods and maintain the labelling and packaging of the Seller so that they are readily identifiable as the property of the Seller;
the purchaser must not sell the Goods except in the ordinary course of the purchaser’s business;
in addition to any rights the Seller may have under Chapter 4 of the PPS Act, the Seller may, at any time, demand the return of the Goods and shall be entitled without notice to the purchaser and without liability to the purchaser, to enter any premises where it suspects the Goods may be located in order to search for and remove the Goods without committing a trespass, even though they may be attached or annexed to other goods or land not the property of the Seller, and for this purpose the purchaser irrevocably licenses the Seller to enter such premises, undertakes that it will procure any necessary authority to enter from any relevant person and also indemnifies the Seller from and against all loss suffered or incurred by the Seller as a result of exercising its rights under this clause, except to the extent that such loss was directly caused by the Seller’s acts or omissions. If there is any inconsistency between the Seller’s rights under this clause and its rights under Chapter 4 of the PPS Act, this clause prevails;
the purchaser acknowledges and warrants the Seller has a security interest (for the purposes of the PPS Act) in the Goods and any proceeds described in clause 7(f)(iv) until title passes to the purchaser in accordance with these Terms. The purchaser must do anything reasonably required by the Seller to enable the Seller to register its security interest, with the priority the Seller requires and to maintain that registration;
the security interest arising under this clause attaches to the Goods when the purchaser obtains possession of the Goods and the parties confirm that they have not agreed that any security interest arising under this clause attaches at any later time; and
the Seller may apply to wind up or bankrupt the purchaser if the goods are not paid for within the Seller’s usual credit terms, even though property in the goods has not passed to the purchaser.
DELAYS
The Seller shall not be liable to the purchaser or to any third party for any delays caused by riots, strikes, lockouts, weather, fire, floods, lack of transportation, accidents, the failure of the Seller’s suppliers to meet their contractual obligations, breakdowns, or any other contingency beyond the Seller’s reasonable control and receipt of the goods by the purchaser shall constitute a waiver of all claims for loss or damage due to delay.
DEFECTIVE GOODS
The purchaser must, as soon as possible after delivery, check whether the Goods were damaged or defective when delivered.
The Goods will be considered to have been delivered in good condition unless the purchaser gives the Seller notice of the damage or defect within 14 days after delivery.
If the purchaser gives the Seller notice under clause 10(b), it must:
preserve the Goods in the state in which they were delivered for 7 days after it gives the Seller the notice; and
during that period, allow the Seller access to the purchaser’s premises to inspect the Goods; or
at the Seller’s request return the Goods, at the purchaser’s cost, within 7 days after notice in accordance with clause 10(b) in the condition in which they were delivered and with all packaging material in as new condition as is reasonably possible in the circumstances.
To the extent permitted by law, the Seller’s liability in respect of defective goods or for breach of a condition, warranty or Consumer Guarantee is limited to any one of the following options as determined by the Seller:
replacement of the Goods or the supply of equivalent Goods;
repair of the Goods;
payment of the cost of replacing the Goods or of acquiring equivalent Goods;
payment of the cost of repairing the Goods; or
where the purchaser is not a Consumer, provision of a credit.
DEFECTIVE SERVICES
The purchaser must, as soon as possible after the Services have been provided give the Seller notice of any Services which are defective within 14 Business Days.
To the extent permitted by law, the Seller’s liability in respect of defective Services or for a breach of a condition, warranty or Consumer Guarantee is limited to any one of the following options as determined by the Seller:
provide the Services again;
pay the cost of having the Services provided again; or
where the purchaser is not a Consumer, provision of a credit.
PRODUCT CHANGES
The Seller reserves the right to change or modify the product in the interest of continuous product improvement without liability. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision will not apply once an order has been accepted  by the Seller.
RETURNED GOODS
Unless the purchaser has rights under the Australian Consumer Law which cannot be lawfully excluded, restricted or modified, if Goods are not defective goods:
Goods may only be returned with the written permission of the General Manager or Manager – Engineering Support of the Seller and when so returned will be Incoterms 2000 DDP to the Seller’s plant;
Goods must be returned in the same re-saleable condition as when they were originally sold, and the costs of return shall be borne by the purchaser;
unless returns are due to an error by the Seller, the purchaser may be charged a reasonable fee which constitutes a genuine pre-estimate of the Seller’s loss arising from the cancellation or return of the Goods; and
any Goods manufactured, processed or purchased on behalf of the purchaser, that meet the purchaser’s specific request may not be accepted for return.
USE / OPERATION OF GOODS
Goods must be used strictly in accordance for the use intended by the Seller, and operated in accordance within the limitations of the Seller’s Operation and Maintenance Manual and any appendixes that it may contain.
Except only for those rights and remedies that the purchaser has in respect of the Goods under the Australian Consumer Law which cannot be lawfully excluded, restricted or modified, the Seller shall have no liability in respect of the Goods where:
the Purchaser undertakes the responsibility of mounting the fan wheel directly to the motor or turbine shafts without the Seller having inspected and tested the assembled unit (at a fee) before the fan is operated in any fashion;
the purchaser replaces any part of the goods with a part that is not the correct genuine Seller part, or such other part as has been approved by the Seller in writing; or
the fan is handled other than in accordance with the handling instructions set out in the relevant Operation and Maintenance Manual.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Seller remains the owner or licensee (as the case may be) of all Intellectual Property Rights owned or used by the Seller prior to the Contract and any other agreement with the Purchaser.
Where any designs or specifications have been supplied by the Purchaser then the Purchaser warrants that the use of those designs or specifications for the manufacture, processing, assembly or supply of the Goods does not infringe the rights of any third party.
The parties agree that any Intellectual Property Rights created or developed under or in connection with the Contract or in the course of supplying the Goods are owned by the Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Seller has designed or drawn Goods for the Purchaser, then the copyright in those designs and drawings remain vested in the Seller, and may only be used by the Purchaser at the Seller’s discretion.
PPS ACT
Unless otherwise defined in this agreement, the terms and expressions used in this clause have the meaning given to them by the PPS Act.
If at any time the Seller determines that the Contract (or any of the transactions contemplated by or under it) creates a security interest in its favour over any personal property, the Seller may apply for any registration, or give any notification, in connection with that security interest and the purchaser must promptly, upon the Seller’s request, do anything (including  signing and producing documents, getting documents completed or signed, obtaining consents and supplying information) to:
provide more effective security over the relevant personal property;
ensure that any such security interest in favour of the Seller:
is at all times enforceable, perfected (including, where applicable, by control as well as by registration) and otherwise effective; and
ranks as a first priority security interest;
enable the Seller to prepare and register a financing statement or a financing change statement or give any notification in connection with that security interest; and
enable the Seller to exercise any of its rights or perform any of its obligations in connection with any such security interest or under the PPS Act.
All reasonably incurred costs and expenses arising as a result of actions taken by the Seller pursuant to clause 13(b) will be for the account of the Seller and the purchaser equally.
If Chapter 4 of the PPS Act would otherwise apply to the enforcement of the security interest created under the Contract, the purchaser agrees that the following provisions of the PPS Act will not apply:
section 95 (notice of removal of accession), to the extent that it requires the Seller to give a notice to the purchaser;
section 121(4) (enforcement of liquid assets – notice to grantor);
section 125 (obligation to dispose of or retain collateral);

section 143 (reinstatement of security agreement).
The Seller does not need to give the purchaser any notice required under the PPS Act (including a notice of a verification statement under section 157 of the PPS Act) unless the requirement for the notice cannot be excluded.
Neither party will disclose to a person or entity that is not a party to the Contract information of the kind mentioned in section 275(1) of the PPS Act unless section 275(7) of the PPS Act applies or that information is publicly available.
