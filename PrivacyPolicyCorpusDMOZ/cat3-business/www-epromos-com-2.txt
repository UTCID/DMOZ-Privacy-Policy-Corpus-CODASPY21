Check Returns
In all cases where we have a check returned for insufficient Funds we will assess a $50.00 fee.
Net 30 Terms
If you are granted payment terms, you agree that if you are late paying your invoice, a 1.5% finance charge or the maximum charge permitted by law may be assessed against all accounts with past due balances. You agree to pay all the company’s reasonable attorney’s fees and all collection agency fees incurred in the collection of any amount owed thereunder and not paid when due.
Shipping Delays
Customer agrees that it will not hold ePromos accountable for delays in delivery occasioned by acts of God or other circumstances over which we have no direct control. Factory shipment or delivery dates are the best estimates of our suppliers, and in no case shall ePromos be liable for any consequential or special damages arising from any delay in delivery.
Warranties
ePromos warrants that all goods sold are free of any security interest and will make available to you all transferable warranties made to ePromos by the manufacturer of the goods. ePromos makes no other express or implied warranties, and specifically makes no implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for purpose.
Merchandise Consistency
Please note that we encourage you to take the opportunity to review a sample of the actual product before you order in bulk quantity. It is important that you understand that these samples are representative in nature. While we are very careful about the suppliers and manufacturers we use, manufacturing variations are unavoidable and a natural result of the manufacturing process. By choosing to place and order with ePromos, you are agreeing to accept merchandise with reasonable manufacturing variances in product material, color and packaging. The most common example of this is apparel dye-lots.
Transfer of Ownership of Merchandise
All goods become your property at the time they are accepted by the carrier.
Acceptance
Your submittal of an online order and/or your signature on our Order Acknowledgment is a conditional acceptance by ePromos of your offer to purchase our goods and your acceptance of our terms and conditions. It may contain terms that differ from or add to those contained in your purchase order, should you have one, and to the extent that this is the case, ePromos hereby expressly conditions its acceptance of your offer on ePromos’ assent to the additional or different terms. Your receipt and retention of the goods covered by this invoice shall constitute acceptance of any such additional or different terms. You and ePromos agree that any contract hereby entered into has been made and is to be construed to New York State Law.
Sales Tax
ePromos is required by law to collect all applicable state and local taxes for services and goods shipped to Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Tennessee. Customers in other states may be required to remit use taxes. Please consult your tax advisor. Companies, individuals and organizations who are exempt from sales tax should provide us with a copy of their resale certificate by fax to 212-286-8198.
Cancellations and Alterations to Existing Orders
Once an Order Acknowledgment is approved, we cannot guarantee our ability to make changes or cancellations to an order. ePromos will make every effort to comply with your cancellation request. If you have already signed your Order Acknowledgment, there will be a minimum charge of $50.00 to cover order entry and preparation expenses. In addition, you are liable to pay the agreed upon price for any work that may have been completed up to the time that we are able to cancel your order. These charges may include but are not limited to setup charges, artwork preparation charges, shipping charges and restocking fees. All completed work and costs incurred will be the responsibility of the customer.
Claims, Adjustments and Returns
If you have any problems with your order please contact customer service at 800-LOGO-216 within 15 days of receipt. We advise opening your merchandise to review its quality if you do not intend to use it right away. After this time we will be unable to go back to our suppliers for credit. Please have your order number available. WE DO NOT ACCEPT UNAUTHORIZED RETURNS. If any problem arises, please call customer service immediately. If necessary we will issue an RMA number (Return Material Authorization) and provide you with a special shipping address.
Overages and Shortages
We try to produce your order in the exact quantity ordered, but this is not always possible due to quality control efforts and fast running machines. We reserve the right to ship and subsequently bill or credit, your charge card or account, for up to 10% over or under the desired quantity.
Shipping Charges
We make every effort to accurately estimate shipping charges. From time to time, we may underestimate the shipping charges on your order. In such event we may make reasonable adjustments to your shipping charges. You always have the option to provide us with a shipping account number (a small handling charge may apply).
Site Pricing
While we make best efforts to keep our site up to date, from time to time actual market conditions may change the price of a product. We reserve the right to change published prices of product offered on our site at anytime. If a published site price is incorrect on an item your have quoted or ordered, we will contact you immediately with the most updated price or help you choose a different item that is within your budget.
Site Images
We make best efforts to provide clear and color-correct product images on our site that best reflect the true nature of the products. However, web site images are inherently limited in their ability to communicate color, scale, and detail. We want to remind customers to be careful about making assumptions about products from the site image alone. We strongly urge our customers to order actual samples. If you choose not to evaluate a physical sample, we cannot be held responsible for the difference between the image as it appears on your monitor and the final product.
Low-Price Guarantee
No one wants to sacrifice service and quality just to save a few pennies. At ePromos we offer great pricing and the best service in the industry. To make sure you never have to choose between service and price, if you find the same item at a lower price, we’ll match that price and even give you 10% off your next order. It’s that simple. Just give us a call and let us know where you found a price that beats ours. As long as it is the same item with the same options, we’ll match any price, no questions asked.
