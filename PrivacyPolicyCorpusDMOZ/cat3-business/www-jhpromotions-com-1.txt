Collecting information on Acts and Services
If you reply to an enquiry we make with you by giving us a quote for your Act or Service we will add your email address, name, phone number and postal address, along with details about what you provide, to a file on our Database.  Any photos you send will also be stored electronically.
What we do with your information
We use your information to keep our clients/prospective clients up to date with the Entertainment Services we can provide them by way of e-marketing, proposals and brochures.  We may also include details and photos of your Act/ Service on our website, Twitter feed and Google advertising.  We do not advertise or share your personal information or contact details with prospective clients, or sell any of your details to any other company.  However if we secure a booking for you we may on occasion need to provide your name and mobile number to the Client for use on the day of the event only.
Your right to see what information we hold.
You can request at any time to see any information that we hold about you.  In order to do this you need to submit your request in writing to margaret@jhpromotions.com or to the postal address shown on our Contacts page.
Opting out
If you do not want us to keep your details on our Database then you can request for them to be removed at any time by sending an email to margaret@jhpromotions.com and we will ensure that this is done.
However, removing your details from our files would mean that we would be unable to promote your Act/ Services to our clients/ prospective clients either on our website or within the brochures or e-marketing that we regularly send out to them.
