At Tru-Test Group (Tru-Test Ltd. (NZ), Tru-Test Pty Ltd.(AUS), Tru-Test Inc.(USA)), we are committed to protecting your privacy and any personal information collected through Tru-Test Group’s marketing activities and website.

Use and Disclosure
Your information will only be used for the purpose for which it was collected unless:
You have consented to another use
The secondary purpose for which we are using your information is related to the primary purpose and you would expect us to use your information for that purpose. This includes direct marketing.
We will use your personal information for the following purposes:
To provide any products and services requested by you
To process payment for products and services you have requested

To respond to customer complaints and provide customer support
To undertake product safety recalls

Internal research
For any future marketing, promotional and publicity purposes
To improve our website and for the development of new products and services
Any other use that you authorise
To meet legal and regulatory requirements
Other uses as may be required from time to time to perform the functions of our business
If we use your information for the secondary purpose of direct marketing, we will when practical to do so, seek your consent before that particular use. We will also provide you with an express opt-out opportunity to express a wish not to receive any further marketing communication from us.
We may disclose your personal information to our service entities and contract out some of our functions to external service providers (such as mailing houses, agencies, contractors, marketing service providers and event coordinators). We may disclose your personal information to these external service providers but only so that they can provide the services that we have contracted out to them.
Data Quality
Tru-Test Group will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up to date.
Please contact us whenever your personal information changes or if you become aware that our records are incorrect. By contacting us, we can take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is correct before we use or disclose it again.
Data Security
At Tru-Test Group, we take security very seriously. We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is safe from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
When your personal information is no longer required for us to undertake the functions for which it was provided (for example, your warranty period has expired and you have informed us that you do not wish to receive any future marketing communication from us), Tru-Test Group will destroy or permanently de-identify that personal information.
Openness
Tru-Test Group is open about how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy Policy clearly expresses our policy on how we manage personal information. This Privacy Policy is available on our website at all times. Tru-Test Group will also make this Privacy Policy available on request and we will let you know what sort of personal information we hold, for what purpose and how we collect, hold, use and disclose that information.
Access and Correction
You have the right to access personal information about yourself and request it be updated and corrected, and to limit the purposes for which it can be used. You may request access to, and corrections to, any personal information we may hold about you by contacting the Tru-Test Group Privacy Officer through the contact methods below. We will provide you with access to your personal information, except where:
Access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual
Access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others
The request for access is frivolous or vexatious
The personal information relates to existing of anticipated legal proceedings and would not be discoverable in those proceedings
Providing access would be unlawful
Denying access is required or authorized by law
The personal information relates to a commercially sensitive decision making process
Providing access would prejudice enforcement activities relating to criminal activities and other breaches of law, public revenue, a security function or negotiations with you.
We will give you reasons if we deny you access to your personal information.
Anonymity
You may choose to deal with us anonymously where it is lawful and practicable to do so.
Identifiers (Australia only)
In some circumstances, we are required to collect government identifiers such as your Australian Business Number or Tax File Number. We will not use or disclose this information other than when required or authorised to by law.
Transborder Data Flows (Australia only)

The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Tru-Test Group
You consent or request the transfer
The personal information is essential for maintaining safety, warranty or service records.
Tru-Test Group takes reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with the National Privacy Principles.

Tru-Test Group will not collect sensitive information which includes such things as information about your health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or memberships of political associations, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, memberships of a professional association or trade union, sexual preferences or criminal records, unless you have consented, it is required by law, or in other special circumstances (e.g. health or public safety).
SPAM
Nobody wants to receive spam. That's why Tru-Test Group has put an anti-spam policy in place. We will not send you any unsolicited commercial electronic messages (such as email or SMS) without your consent. Any commercial electronic message that we send will identify Tru-Test as a sender and will incorporate our contact details. Tru-Test will not use address-harvesting software under any circumstances.
