General Assembly.As the pandemic washed over the world and made shipping crews unwelcome in many ports, he said, “We received very limited information, and it became increasingly difficult to get vital supplies and technical support. Nations changed regulations on a daily, if not hourly, basis.”Several months later, many borders remain closed and flights are rare, complicating efforts to bring in replacement crews for those stuck at sea and forcing their employers to keep extending their contracts.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres joined shipping companies, trade unions and maritime organizations in urging governments to recognize merchant crews as essential workers and allow them to travel more freely. With more than 80% of global trade by volume transported by sea, the world’s 2 million merchant seafarers play a vital role.Merchant ship crews are used to long stretches away from home, but as virus infections and restrictions spread early this year, anxiety mounted along with the uncertainty, Marzougui said.“Not knowing when or if we would be returning home put severe mental strain on my crew and myself," he said. "We felt like second-class citizens with no input or control over our lives."The Tunisian-born captain spent an extra three months at sea and finally made it home to his family in Florida in late May. But more than 300,000 mariners are still stranded, waiting for replacement crews; about as many are waiting on shore, trying to get back to work.Maritime officials from Panama, the Philippines, Canada, France and Kenya defended steps they have taken individually to allow safe crew changes or otherwise ease the crisis.But officials lamented a lack of international coordination among nations and shipping companies, calling for new rules to protect countries from the virus while respecting the rights of stranded crews.No figures were released for how many merchant mariners have contracted the virus, but Guy Platten of the International Chamber of Shipping said the virus risk is “relatively low" because shipping companies have strict protection measures and “have no wish whatsoever to bring infections on our ships.”He blamed “red tape and bureaucracy" for crew change delays and said border guards and local port officials in some countries are being overzealous in blocking them from coming ashore. One way goods are still able to get ashore despite restrictions is by dock workers fetching them from the ships.France proposed compiling a global U.N. list of ports that can be secured to accommodate crew changes. Kenya called for sharing costs globally for a rapid testing plan for major ports.Crews often work 12-hour shifts with no weekends, and Marzougui warned that extending stints without a break risks physical and mental strain — potentially putting ships and oceans in danger.The captain compared it to telling a marathon runner at the end of the race that they had to “do it again, right away, with no rest.”LatestOklahoma Asks Court: Make J&J Pay $9.3B to End Opioid CrisisDec 10th, 2020EPA Overrides Scientists' Calls for Tougher Pollutant LimitDec 9th, 2020Cybersecurity Firm Says it Was Hacked by State ActorDec 9th, 2020New White House Offer Adds $600 Checks to COVID-19 ReliefDec 9th, 2020MoreHomeVirus-Ravaged Glove Maker Nets Record ProfitsThe company is the world's largest rubber glove maker.Dec 9th, 2020HomeCompany Offering Pandemic Stock Tips Accused of $137M FraudThe founders of Raging Bull claimed they found a "hidden bull market" in the COVID-19 pandemic.Dec 8th, 2020HomeAmid Pandemic, Grants Keep Army Veteran's Business AfloatThe pandemic has hit military families especially hard.Dec 8th, 2020HomeMining Giant Glencore Lays Out Climate PlanThe company aims to stop adding greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere by 2050.Dec 8th, 2020HomeYears of Research Laid Groundwork for Speedy COVID-19 ShotsMore than a decade of behind-the-scenes work is credited for the success.Dec 8th, 2020HomeUber, Hard-Hit by Pandemic, Sells Its Robot-Vehicle DivisionSelf-driving vehicle technology company Aurora will acquire the employees and technology behind Uber's Advanced Technologies Group.Dec 8th, 2020HomeOPEC, Russia to Nudge up Oil Output After Hit from PandemicOil producing countries face a dilemma: producing more increases their revenues but could send prices lower.Dec 4th, 2020HomeUS Plans Oil, Gas Lease Sale in Alaska's Arctic RefugeOpponents alleged that the Bureau of Land Management failed to adequately consider the potential effects of a leasing program.Dec 4th, 2020HomeFreighter Stuck in Detroit River Slows Great Lakes ShippingAnother ship struck the bottom while trying to avoid the stuck freighter.Dec 4th, 2020HomeExplosives Topple 1,000-Foot Stack at Old Power PlantThe steel from the structure will be recycled.Dec 4th, 2020HomeBoeing Gets a Boost from Ryanair Order for 75 More Max JetsThe order would be worth more than $9 billion at list prices.Dec 4th, 2020HomeUS Jobless Claims Remain High at 712,000The U.S. economy and job market remain under stress from the intensified viral outbreak.Dec 3rd, 2020Follow UsFacebook iconTwitter iconMost RecentHow Manufacturers Can Control Their Facility MRO CostsExplosives Topple 1,000-Foot Stack at Old Power PlantHewlett Packard Enterprise to Move Headquarters7 Killed in Factory ExplosionCompany Pleads Guilty to Charge Related to Worker Death
