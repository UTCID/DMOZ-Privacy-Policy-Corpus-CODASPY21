• California Rights
Last Updated: June 1, 2019
Privacy Policy
Demco, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "Demco," "we," "us," or "our") takes great care in addressing the privacy and security of data we collect. This Privacy Policy describes the information collected through this website ("Site") and how that information is used and shared.
Demco and its suppliers may collect or receive the types of information described below in connection with your access to and use of the Site (together, "Collected Information").
By accessing or using the Site you agree on behalf of yourself and any institution or organization that you represent (together, "you") that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Modifications to this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made a part of the Site's Terms of Use. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in our sole discretion. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site. If any modifications are material, we will provide a prominent notice of those changes on the Site or otherwise communicate those changes to you. Continued use of the Site following any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute acceptance of and agreement to be bound by those modifications. If you do not accept or agree to the modifications, your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the Site.
We Collect Information that You Submit
Personal Information. To purchase products using the Site or to use certain other features and functions of the Site, you will need to disclose personal information. For example, personal information must be entered when creating an online Demco customer account, when ordering products via the Site, when submitting an inquiry to us through the Site, or when requesting a Demco catalog. We collect personal information voluntarily provided to us, which information may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and payment information. We use personal information as described below, including to process orders, to communicate with you in connection with your use of the Site, and to provide and support the Site, subject in each case to applicable laws and the terms of this Privacy Policy.
User-Generated Content. You acknowledge that the Site may allow you to enter, submit, upload, or transmit content via the Site that is then made available to other users of the Site ("User-Generated Content"). User-Generated Content that you provide is posted on the Site at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that submitted User-Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand that, even after removal, copies of User-Generated Content that you have provided may remain viewable in cached and archived pages and may have been copied or stored by Internet archives and other users of the Site. Demco will make User-Generated Content available to other users of the Site, as applicable, and will use and disclose User-Generated Content for the purpose for which it was provided, for example, to publish user comments on our blog and to display product reviews.
Order & Payment Information. Payments submitted through the Site must be made by credit or debit card or, for institutional accountholders with prior approval (obtained via a credit application), by using an existing business account. All credit and debit card information is provided directly to our PCI-compliant third-party payment processor. Demco does not directly access, handle, or store credit or debit card information. To submit a payment you will need to submit your name and your credit or debit card type, number, expiration date, security code, and billing address. Payment by credit or debit card is subject to the approval of the card issuer. We will not be liable in any way if a card issuer refuses to accept a credit or debit card for any reason. If you submit payment via check or ACH, you will need to provide your bank account number and routing number. We will maintain a record of the orders placed and payments made using the Site.
Mailing List Information. If you sign up or otherwise opt in to receive promotions from us, you will need to submit your name and email address. We will use this information to provide you with promotional and other electronic communications. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the applicable email. We may use third-party email providers to deliver these communications to you. To sign up to receive our hard copy catalogs, you will need to also submit your mailing address and telephone number.
Refer a Friend. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our products or services, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send that person a one-time email invite to visit the applicable Demco website. We will store this information for purposes of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Job Opportunities. The Site may include or link to job descriptions for opportunities at Demco from time to time. To view job opportunities at Demco and to submit job applications you will be redirected to an online career portal hosted and operated by a third party. We encourage you to review the terms and privacy policy posted on that portal. If you submit job application materials to that third party, those materials will be shared with us so that we may use those materials to evaluate your qualifications and, where appropriate, respond to you. Submission of materials does not require us to review them or consider you for employment.
Other Information We Collect
We also collect and use the following types of information:
IP Addresses and Related Data. We may collect (or have collected on our behalf) data pertaining to you and the equipment, software, and communication methods you use to access the Internet and the Site, including Internet protocol ("IP") addresses assigned to the computers and other devices from where you access the Internet, your Internet service provider (ISP), your approximate geographic location, your browser type, the pages you access on the Site, the length of time you spend on the Site, date and time stamps, and clickstream data. Demco may use this information to administer the Site and its servers, to generate statistical information, to monitor and analyze Site traffic and usage patterns, to monitor and help prevent fraud, to investigate complaints and violations of our policies, and to improve the Site's content and the products, services, materials, and other content that we describe or make available through the Site. We may combine this information with other Collected Information (including personal information) and information obtained from third parties for the purposes discussed herein. The suppliers that we use to provide the Site may collect information about your visits to and use of the Site. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies as explained further below under "Cookies."
Geographical Location Information. In addition to the approximate geographic location information collected as discussed above, we may, with your consent, access more specific location information to enhance the user experience and increase the usefulness of the Site. This includes both geographical location information that you input using the Site (e.g., when you enter your physical address) and geographical location information collected by device-based location services, such as GPS data and data collected by similar technologies. You may choose to allow us to access your location by granting the Site access to your location when prompted or through your device's location services settings. If you do not want us to use your specific location information collected, you may opt out of that use through your device's location services settings.
Cookies. The Site automatically uses cookies to track Site use and to facilitate and enhance the user experience on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your device's hard drive by your browser. The Site may implement both cookies that we implement ourselves and third-party cookies, which are implemented by our vendors and other third parties. We use cookies to streamline navigation of the Site, log user preferences to better facilitate a user's next visit (e.g., by remembering your contact information or log-in credentials), track how you access and use the Site, to learn how popular parts of the Site are and aren't, and facilitate use of interactive features on the Site.
A cookie can either be a "session" cookie or a "persistent" cookie. Session cookies exist only for so long as you are visiting the applicable website. Session cookies are typically deleted or removed when you exit or quit your browser. Persistent cookies exist for a set period of time, for example, six months or one year. Each time you visit a website that has implemented a persistent cookie, that cookie will remain active until its predetermined expiration date. You can also manually delete persistent cookies as discussed below.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can disable this function, but disabling cookies may impact your use and enjoyment of the Site. Certain features of the Site may require cookies to be active and to function properly. When cookies are disabled, such features may not be available. Most browsers allow users to manage cookies in the browser's settings. For example, a browser may allow you to reject cookies from certain websites, reject certain types of cookies regardless of the website, reject or disable all cookies from all websites, and/or delete cookies stored previously. Changing your cookie preferences in one browser will not necessarily carry over to other browsers, so you may need to adjust your preferences each time you get a new computer, install a new browser, upgrade an existing browser, or alter or delete a browser's cookie file. Our suppliers may use cookies and other tracking technologies to track Site users across the Internet to understand how you get to the Site and for the analytics purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
The Site may also use Flash cookies, which differ from the browser cookies discussed above with respect to the amount and types of data collected and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove and cannot manage Flash cookies. To learn about managing your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's website here.
How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Requests. Because of the automated collection of data using cookies on the Site as discussed above, we do not honor "Do Not Track" requests.
Website Analytics. The Site uses third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, FullStory, and Bazaarvoice) to collect and process information about your use of the Site, including when you visit the Site, URLs of the websites that you visit prior to visiting the Site and when you visit those websites, and IP addresses assigned to the devices from where you access the Internet. Our analytics providers may set and read cookies to collect this information and your web browser will automatically send information collected by those cookies to our analytics providers. This information is stored on the analytics providers' servers. Our analytics providers use this information to provide us with reports that we will use to improve the Site's structure and content, for example, reports about Site traffic and user visits to the Site.
For more information on how Google uses this data, visit Google's Privacy Policy and Google's page on "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps". To prevent this data from being used by Google Analytics, follow the instructions to download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for each web browser you use. Using the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on will not prevent Demco from using other analytics tools and will not prevent data from being sent to the Site itself or to Google. You may disable cookies as discussed above, but that may impact your use and enjoyment of the Site.
We encourage you to review FullStory's Privacy Policy. To opt out of FullStory, click here.
We encourage you to review Bazaarvoice's Privacy Policy. To opt out of Bazaarvoice, click here.
Advertising Networks, Personalized Advertising, Remarketing, and Retargeting. From time to time the Site may use or participate in advertising networks and related advertising services that are managed and provided by third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors, and research firms, including Google Ads and advertising retargeting services provided by Facebook (sometimes referred to the Facebook "tracking pixel") or other social media platforms. These services collect information about your visits to and interactions with the Site and other websites and will use that information to target advertisements for goods and services. The information collected may be associated with your personal information. These targeted advertisements may appear on the Site or on other websites. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer's interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer's specific interests. This practice is often referred to as "online behavioral advertising." For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of the Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website, and other interactions between you and a website.
Through Google Ads, Google uses your Internet searches, cookies, and similar identifiers (e.g., pixel tags) to collect information about your visits to the Site and your interaction with our products and services to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit across the Internet. Additionally, we may enable and implement various Google Analytics Advertising Features on the Site, such as: Remarketing with Analytics, Demographics and Interest reporting, Campaign Manager integration, Display & Video 360 integration, Google Display Network (GDN) Impression Reporting, and Segments. Remarketing with Analytics uses Google Analytics cookies to serve advertisements to you across the Internet based on your visits to the Site. Demographics and Interest reporting uses a third-party cookie to collect information about our Site traffic by tracking users across websites and across time, which generates a report for us to better understand Site users. Campaign Manager integration allow us to view, analyze, and create remarketing lists using our Campaign Manager data in Google Analytics. Display & Video 360 integration allows us to create remarketing lists in Google Analytics and have those lists available in Display & Video 360. Google Display Network ("GDN") Impression Reporting allows us to measure the impact of unclicked GDN Display ad impressions on website behavior and conversions. Segments allows us to isolate and analyze subsets of Site users by sorting our Google Analytics data. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google's collection or use of this information, visit Google's Safety Center and Google's Ad Settings and follow Google's personalized ad opt-out instructions. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site.
If you do not want social media platforms to collect information relating to you via the Site or to link information collected via the Site to your social media accounts, we suggest that you: (a) do not connect to or share information with social media platforms using the Site; (b) hide social media platform plug-ins using an ad blocker; (c) always log off completely from social media platforms before visiting the Site or other websites and delete all related cookies; and, (d) where the option made available by a social media platform, disable the advertising services and networks operated by that platform.
To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads and to obtain more information about third-party ad networks and online behavioral advertising, please visit the National Advertising Initiative Consumer opt-out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program. Please remember that changing your settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time.
Social Media. The Site may allow you to connect to and share information with various social media platforms, for example, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest,but the Site will not log you in to those social media platforms automatically. These features may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by those social media platforms to facilitate those communications and features. We may share information that you provide us or that we may collect about your use of the Site with those platforms and that information will be subject to their privacy policies. We cannot control any policies or terms of such third party platform. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use of your information or content by a third party platform, which you use at your own risk. We encourage you to review those platforms' privacy policies:
Facebook's Data Policy at https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy
Twitter's Privacy Policy at https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en
LinkedIn's Privacy Policy at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=hb_ft_priv
