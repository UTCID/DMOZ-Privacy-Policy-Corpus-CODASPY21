Home » About » Quality Policy
Tidel is passionate about quality. We use the best, time-proven techniques in manufacturing and quality assurance to ensure on-time delivery. Demanding customers, such as multinational oil companies and convenience store operators, have recognized our excellence in product workmanship and performance. Our high standards of quality and reliability allow Tidel to offer the longest and most comprehensive warranties in the industry.
Tidel has furthered its commitment to quality by undergoing ISO 9001:2015 certification, for its quality management systems in the design, manufacture and distribution of cash handling and delivery machines. Registration was awarded by SRI Quality System Registrar, an accredited U.S. registrar, following an extensive independent audit of Tidel Engineering’s system of quality standards and procedures.
ISO 9001:2015 is an internationally recognized standard that defines the requirements for a quality management system that, among other things, consistently meets customer quality demands and regulatory requirements worldwide. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the 2015 standards emphasize Customer Focus, Leadership, Engagement of People, Process Approach, Improvement, Evidence-Based Decision-Making, and Relationship Management, and replace the 2008 version of the standards.
