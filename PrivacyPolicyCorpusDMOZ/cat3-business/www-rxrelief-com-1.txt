In addition, you agree that you will not email any of your User Submissions or links to your User Submissions to individuals with whom you are not acquainted.
You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them.

14. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS You consent to receive electronic communications from PrideStaff either in the form of emails sent to you at the email address listed on your account or by communications posted on the Sites or in the Services. You acknowledge and agree that any electronic communication in the form of such email or posting on the Sites and/or Services shall satisfy any legal requirement that such communication be in writing.
15. RIGHT TO ACCESS / AGE OF USERSYou must be at least 13 years of age or older to access or use the Sites or Services offered through the Sites, which are not intended for children under 13. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, if we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will remove it from our systems immediately. If you are under 18 years of age but are at least 13 years old (a “Minor”), you must only use the Sites and Services with the consent of your parent or legal guardian and you must have received your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to use the Sites and Services and agree to these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you hereby agree to bind the Minor to these Terms and to fully indemnify and hold harmless PrideStaff if the Minor breaches any of these Terms.
16. LIMITED TIME TO BRING CLAIMWhere permitted by law, you agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Sites, Services, any Content, or User Submissions must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
17. BINDING ARBITRATION(i) Purpose. If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with PrideStaff that cannot be resolved through an informal dispute resolution with PrideStaff, you or PrideStaff elect to arbitrate that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration provision rather than litigate the Dispute in court. Arbitration means you will have a hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
(ii) Definitions. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and PrideStaff regarding any aspect of your relationship with PrideStaff, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the class action waiver clause provided in this paragraph). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. As used in this Arbitration provision, “PrideStaff” means PrideStaff, its affiliates, franchisees and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.
(iii) Right to Opt Out of Arbitration. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY PRIDESTAFF IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT BY SENDING NOTICE TO: PRIDESTAFF, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT, 7535 N. PALM AVE., STE. 101, FRESNO, CA 93711. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO PRIDESTAFF MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH PRIDESTAFF THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PRIDESTAFF OR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO YOU BY PRIDESTAFF. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED PRIDESTAFF OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.
(iv) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or PrideStaff elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration provision, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate the arbitration proceeding with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), 335 Madison Ave., Floor 10, New York, NY 10017-4605, 1-800-778-7879, www.adr.org, under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA.
(v) Arbitration Procedures. Because the Services provided to you by PrideStaff concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes. Applicable Federal law or the law of the state where you receive the service from PrideStaff may apply to and govern the substance of any Disputes. Any state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall not be applicable under this Arbitration provision.
If there is a conflict between this Arbitration provision and the rules of the arbitration organization chosen, this Arbitration provision shall govern. If the arbitration organization that you select will not enforce this Arbitration provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve your dispute with PrideStaff. If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will enforce this Arbitration provision as written. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration provision shall govern.
A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. You should know that participating in arbitration may result in limited discovery depending on the rules of the arbitration organization that is chosen to resolve the Dispute. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect user account information and other confidential or proprietary information.
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. An award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization. The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party’s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA.
(vi) Restrictions. YOU MUST CONTACT US WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE, OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS, OR DISPUTE. ALL PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY NAMED. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED UNLESS THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH YOU ARE SUING PROVIDES OTHERWISE. ALL PARTIES WAIVE ANY CLAIM TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR MULTIPLIED DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY DISPUTE WITH PRIDESTAFF UNLESS THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH THEY ARE SUING PROVIDES OTHERWISE.
(vii) Location of Arbitration. The arbitration will take place in Fresno County, California.
(viii) Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs. PRIDESTAFF WILL ADVANCE ALL ARBITRATION FILING FEES AND ARBITRATOR’S COSTS AND EXPENSES UPON YOUR WRITTEN REQUEST GIVEN PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR IN THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ATTORNEYS OR EXPERT WITNESSES. IF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS DECIDED IN PRIDESTAFF’S FAVOR, YOU SHALL REIMBURSE PRIDESTAFF FOR THE FEES AND COSTS ADVANCED TO YOU ONLY UP TO THE EXTENT AWARDABLE IN A JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. IF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS DETERMINED IN YOUR FAVOR, YOU WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE PRIDESTAFF FOR ANY OF THE FEES AND COSTS ADVANCED BY PRIDESTAFF. IF A PARTY ELECTS TO APPEAL AN AWARD TO A THREE-ARBITRATOR PANEL, THE PREVAILING PARTY IN THE APPEAL SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ALL REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS INCURRED IN THAT APPEAL. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, PRIDESTAFF WILL PAY ALL FEES AND COSTS THAT IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO PAY.
(ix) Severability. If any clause within this Arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver clause identified above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration provision, and the remainder of this Arbitration provision will be given full force and effect. If the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court.
In the event this entire Arbitration provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim is brought in a Dispute that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of this Arbitration provision, you and PrideStaff have each agreed to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.
(x) Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND PRIDESTAFF AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION: (1) ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY PRIDESTAFF THAT IS NOT AGGREGATED WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER USER AND WHOSE AMOUNT IN CONTROVERSY IS PROPERLY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF A COURT THAT IS LIMITED TO ADJUDICATING SMALL CLAIMS; (2) ANY DISPUTE OVER THE VALIDITY OF ANY PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND (3) ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM ALLEGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH UNAUTHORIZED USE OR RECEIPT OF A SERVICE. (xi) Continuation. This Arbitration provision shall survive the termination of your user relationship with PrideStaff.
18. GENERAL PROVISIONS The Sites and Services are intended for persons that reside within the United States of America. PrideStaff makes no representations or warranties that the Sites, Services or any Content or offers provided herein are valid or appropriate for use outside of the United States. Those who access or use the Sites or Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
No waiver of any provision or of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions or any other or further breach. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such provision shall be severed, and the balance of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
This Agreement has been entered into in the state of California and the validity, interpretation and legal effect of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable U.S. federal law, and the laws of California, without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles. Except in those cases where contractual attribution of jurisdiction is not enforceable on the user as a consumer, any disputes that may arise concerning the formation, interpretation or performance of this Agreement which are not amicably resolved or resolved by arbitration, shall be brought in Federal and/or state courts of the State of California and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
These Terms set forth the entire understanding between you and PrideStaff with respect to its subject matter.
These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by PrideStaff without restriction.
