Valuer Appointment Policy
Valuer Appointment Policy
In the 2017 Audit Committee Report, we announced a new policy regarding the appointment of external valuers.
The external valuation of our property portfolio is a key determinant of our balance sheet, our performance and the remuneration of senior management. The Audit Committee is therefore committed to the rigorous monitoring and review of our valuers' effectiveness, as well as the valuation process itself. The new policy supports this commitment.
The key elements of the Policy are (subject to JV / third party approval where required):
the duration of a valuer's appointment to cover a specific asset is limited to 10 years (excepting where an asset has been market tested in the period)
an agreed panel of valuers with the required level of market knowledge and service provision will be maintained
incumbents on an asset cannot be re-appointed
there will be a minimum of two valuers on each of our main sectors, with each valuer covering a meaningful proportion of both the overall portfolio and relevant sector.
To ensure a manageable transition of assets to new valuers, the initial re-tender process will be spread over three years, running 2017-2019. As of 31 March 2020, 84% of the portfolio was under new instruction since the transition process began in the year ended 31 March 2018.
