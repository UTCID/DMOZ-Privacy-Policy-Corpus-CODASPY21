Privacy Policy:
Easton Bike ("Easton Bike")
operates EastonBike.com and may operate other websites. It
is Easton Bike's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Easton Bike collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Easton Bike's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how Easton Bike's visitors use its website. From time to
time, Easton Bike may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Easton Bike also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on EastonBike.com
blogs/sites. Easton Bike only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Easton Bike's websites choose to interact
with Easton Bike in ways that require Easton Bike to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Easton Bike gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at EastonBike.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Easton Bike are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, Easton Bike collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
Easton Bike. Easton Bike does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Easton Bike may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. Easton Bike may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Easton Bike does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Easton Bike discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on Easton Bike's behalf or to provide services available
at Easton Bike's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using Easton Bike's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. Easton Bike will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Easton Bike discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when Easton Bike believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Easton Bike, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an Easton Bike website and have supplied your email address, Easton Bike
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what's going on with Easton Bike and our products. If you send us a request (for
example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Easton Bike takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Business Transfers
If Easton Bike, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event
that Easton Bike goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
any acquirer of Easton Bike may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this
policy.

Policy covers the use of cookies by Easton Bike and does not cover the use of cookies by any
