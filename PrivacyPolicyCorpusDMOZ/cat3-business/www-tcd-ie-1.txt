Research Participants
One of the objectives of Trinity College as defined in the Universities Act, 1997 is to carry out and support research.

Where possible personal data collected for research purposes will be pseudonymised so that the participant is no longer identifiable. The use of personal data for research will often involve sensitive personal data including health or genetic data and will therefore be subject to higher standards of security and protection.
Detailed information and guidance on the processing of personal data for research purposes, including the processing of personal data for the purposes of health research pursuant to the Health Research Regulations 2018 and associated compliance requirements, is available from the University data protection web pages.

In the event that we do record your data on a mailing list you will be provided with the opportunity to opt out from the outset and in all our communications with you and we will only send you information relevant to your initial enquiry or transaction.
