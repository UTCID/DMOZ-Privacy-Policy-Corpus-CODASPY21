You and Monterey Mushrooms each agree that each party will assert Claims in arbitration only in our individual capacity, and not as a representative or member of any purported class. We each agree that we will not participate in any class, mass, collective, consolidated, private attorney general or other representative arbitration proceeding.

Either party may bring individual Claims in small claims court.Arbitration Procedures. Either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding, which will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.Arbitration Provider. Each party will initiate arbitration before JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) or any successor to JAMS, which is an alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”). In the event JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within fourteen (14) days of the filing of a “Demand for Arbitration”, then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by another mutually agreeable arbitration administration service who will hear the case.Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) (“Arbitration Rules”). The rules of the ADR Provider will govern all aspects of the arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Arbitration Agreement.Arbitration Location. If an in-person hearing is required, then it will take place in Minneapolis, MN, Chicago, IL, New York City, NY, Los Angeles, CA, Atlanta, GA or Dallas, TX (whichever is closest to your residence), unless the claimant primarily resides outside the United States (in which case the arbitrator will give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings).Fees. Payment of all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Arbitration Rules.Arbitrator’s Authority and Award. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of the parties, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the ADR Provider’s Rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and reasoned statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. Any award will be subject to judicial confirmation or entry in any court having jurisdiction.Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to, the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement or to enforce an arbitration award.No Assignment These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with the prior written consent of a duly authorized Monterey Mushrooms employee.WaiverOur failure at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms or to exercise any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of such provision or such right. All waivers must be in writing. Unless the written waiver contains an express statement to the contrary, no waiver by Monterey Mushrooms of any breach of any provision of these Terms or of any right provided for herein will be construed as a waiver of any continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right under these Terms.SeverabilityIf any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Governing LawThese Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.
