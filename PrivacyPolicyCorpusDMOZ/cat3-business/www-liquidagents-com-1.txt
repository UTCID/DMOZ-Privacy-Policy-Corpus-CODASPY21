2. Changes to these Terms or the Services. We may change or modify these Terms from time to time without notice other than posting the revised version on the Site and/or the App. The amended Terms will automatically be effective upon such posting.

You may not use them in any way that violates applicable law (including but not limited to any law regarding the transfer of personal information to or from the U.S.A.), or which interferes with the operability or security of the Site, the App, other accounts, or any materials or information not intentionally made available through the Services. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any access to the Services or any information, materials, or services obtained from the Services.
