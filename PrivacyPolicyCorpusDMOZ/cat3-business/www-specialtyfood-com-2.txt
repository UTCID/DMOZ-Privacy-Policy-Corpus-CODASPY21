Privacy Notice
We Are Committed to Your Privacy
The Specialty Food Association (“SFA”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. When you attend an SFA event and/or visit the SFA websites specialtyfood.com and my.fancyfoodshows.com (each a “Website” and together, the “Websites”), we help you maintain control over your personal information. We will collect, store and use your personal information solely to support and enhance your relationship with us and our members. For example, we may use your personal information to share products and services of the SFA and its members, partners and sponsors, and to update you regarding trade news, SFA events and offerings. The SFA does not sell your personal information. We share your personal information only with your consent, as required by law, or with companies that help the SFA fulfill its obligations to you, and then only with companies who share the SFA's commitment to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information. You may contact the SFA at any time with any privacy questions or concerns you may have. You may also ask at any time to see the personal information you have given us and request correction or deletion.
We only Ask for Specific Types of Personal Information
In a few areas on our Websites, online support tools, and occasionally at our events, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your Website experience and/or the event, to assist you with technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit.
