Ingles Pharmacy Notice of Privacy Practices
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
This Notice of Privacy Practices (the “Notice”) describes the privacy practices of Ingles Pharmacy that is owned by Ingles Markets Inc. This group of pharmacy locations treats itself as a single entity for purposes of using and disclosing health information about you.
Protected Health Information ("PHI") is information that may identify you and that relates to your health, medical conditions and prescriptions. Ingles Pharmacy is required by law to protect the privacy of your health information and to provide you with this Notice explaining our legal duties and privacy practices regarding your health information. Ingles Pharmacy is required to follow the terms of this Notice or any change to it that is in effect. We reserve the right to change our practices and this Notice and to make the new Notice effective for all PHI we maintain. If we do so, the updated Notice will be posted on our website and will be available at our facilities and locations where you receive health care products and services from us. Upon request, we will provide any revised Notice to you.
How We May Use and Disclose Your PHIBelow are examples of how federal law permits use or disclosure of your PHI for these purposes without your permission; however, not every permissible use or disclosure will be listed in this Notice. Note that some types of PHI, such as HIV information, genetic information, alcohol and/or substance abuse records, and mental health records may be subject to special confidentiality protections under applicable state or federal law and we will abide by these special protections. If you would like additional information about special state law protections, you may contact the Privacy Office or visit www.ingles-markets.com.
I. Uses and Disclosures of PHI That Do Not Require Your Prior AuthorizationExcept where prohibited by federal or state laws that require special privacy protections, we may use and disclose your PHI for treatment, payment and health care operations without your prior authorization as follows:
Treatment. We may use and disclose your PHI to provide and coordinate the treatment, medications and services you receive. For example, we may disclose PHI to pharmacists, doctors, nurses, technicians and other personnel involved in your health care. We may also disclose your PHI with other third parties, such as hospitals, other pharmacies and other health care facilities and agencies to facilitate the provision of health care services, medications, equipment and supplies you may need.
Payment. We may use and disclose your PHI in order to obtain payment for the health care products and services that we provide to you and for other payment activities related to the services that we provide. For example, we may contact your insurer, payor, or other agent and share your PHI with that entity to determine whether it will pay for your prescription and the payment amount. We may also contact you about a payment or balance due for prescriptions dispensed to you at Ingles Pharmacy. We may also disclose your PHI to other health care providers or HIPAA covered entities who may need it for their payment activities.
Health Care Operations. We may use and disclose your PHI to monitor the effectiveness and quality of our health care services, to provide customer services to you and to resolve complaints. For example, we may use your PHI as part of our efforts to continually improve the quality and effectiveness of the health care products and services we provide. We may also analyze PHI to improve the quality and efficiency of health care, for example, to assess and improve outcomes for health care conditions. We may also disclose your PHI to other HIPAA covered entities that have provided services to you so that they can improve the quality and effectiveness of the health care services that they provide. We may use your PHI to create de-identified data, which is stripped of your identifiable data and no longer identifies you.
We may also use and disclose your PHI without your prior authorization for the following purposes:Business Associates. We may contract with third parties to perform certain services for us. These third party service providers, referred to as Business Associates, are required by contract and law to protect your PHI and only use and disclose it as necessary to perform their services for us.
Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care. In these cases, you have both the right and choice to tell us to disclose to a family member, other relative, close personal friend, or any other person you choose to identify, PHI directly relevant to that person’s involvement in your care or payment related to your care. However, if we can reasonably infer that you agree, we may provide prescriptions and related information to your representative on your behalf if we believe it is in your best interest.
Parents or Legal Guardians. If you are a minor, we may release your PHI to your parents or legal guardians when we are permitted or required under federal and applicable state law.
Worker’s Compensation. To the extent necessary to comply with law, we may disclose your PHI to worker’s compensation or other similar programs established by law.
Public Health Activities. We may disclose your PHI to public health or legal authorities charged with preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These activities may include the following: disclosures to report reactions to medications or other products; disclosures to notify individuals of recalls, exposure to a disease, or risk for contracting or spreading a disease or condition.
Law Enforcement. We may disclose your PHI for law enforcement purposes as required or permitted by law – for example, in response to a subpoena, court order, summons, or similar process for law enforcement purposes.
Abuse or Neglect. If you have been a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence, we may disclose your Protected Health Information to the government agency authorized to receive such information.
As Required by Law. We will disclose your PHI when required to do so by federal, state or local law.Health Oversight Activities. We may disclose your PHI to an oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities include audits, investigations, inspections, and credentialing, as necessary for licensure and for the government to monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance with federal, state or local laws.
United States Department of Health and Human Services: Under federal law, we are required to disclose your PHI to the Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to determine if we are in compliance with federal laws and regulations regarding the privacy of health information.
Judicial and Administrative Proceedings. If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose your PHI in response to a court or administrative order, subpoena, discover request, or other lawful process.
Although we may not engage in the following activities, under federal or applicable state law, we are allowed to use or disclose your PHI without your permission for these purposes:
Research. Under certain circumstances, we may use your PHI to conduct research and we may disclose your PHI to researchers as authorized by law. For example, we may use or disclose your PHI as part of a research study when the research has been approved by an institutional review board or privacy board that has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your information.
Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors. We may disclose your PHI to coroners, medical examiners, or funeral directors so that they can carry out their duties. This may be necessary, for example, to identify a deceased person or determine the cause of death.

You may revoke an authorization in writing at any time. Upon receipt of the written revocation, we will stop using or disclosing your PHI, except to the extent that we have already taken action in reliance on the authorization.

Request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of PHI. You have the right to request additional restrictions on our use or disclosure of your PHI by sending a written request to the Privacy Office. We are not required to agree to the restrictions, except in the case where the disclosure is to a health plan for purposes of carrying out payment or health care operations, is not otherwise required by law, and the PHI pertains solely to a health care item or service for which you, or a person on your behalf, has paid in full.
Inspect and obtain a copy of PHI. With a few exceptions, you have the right to timely access and obtain a copy of the PHI that we maintain about you within 30 days.

To inspect or obtain a copy of your PHI, you must send a written request to the Privacy Office. You may ask us to send a copy of your PHI to other individuals or entities that you designate. We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain limited circumstances. If you are denied access to your PHI, you may request that the denial be reviewed.
Request an amendment of PHI. If you feel that PHI we maintain about you is incomplete or incorrect, you may request that we amend it.

Request communications of PHI by alternative means or at alternative locations.

For instance, you may request that we contact you at a different residence or post office box, or via e-mail or other electronic means. Please note if you choose to receive communications from us via e-mail or other electronic means, those may not be a secure means of communication and your PHI that may be contained in our e-mails to you will not be encrypted.
