Disclaimer of Warranties
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY IDEAL AND EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW:
IDEAL MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION REGARDING THIS SITE OR ANY SITE CONTENT.
THIS SITE AND ALL SITE CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, IDEAL DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THIS SITE AND ALL SITE CONTENT.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, IDEAL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SITE AND ALL SITE CONTENT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; OR THAT ANY DEFECT OR ERROR WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THIS SITE AND ALL SITE CONTENT ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU USE THIS SITE AND ALL SITE CONTENT ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
SOME STATES MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. BUT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
Limitation of Liability
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL IDEAL AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF USE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS GOODWILL OR OPPORTUNITY) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SITE OR ANY SITE CONTENT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES.
BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR TOTAL LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
User Indemnity
YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS IDEAL AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES, FOR AND FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, SUITS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND LEGAL COSTS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO (I) YOUR USE OF THIS SITE OR ANY SITE CONTENT OR (II) ANY USER CONTENT SUBMITTED BY YOU.
Governing Law
These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, U.S.A. (without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof). You and IDEAL agreethat the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall NOT apply to these Terms of Use or your use of this Site (including any purchase you make on this Site).
Arbitration Agreement
You and IDEAL agree that any dispute or claim relating to your use of this Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and (ii) IDEAL may bring actions in court to enforce intellectual property rights. The United States Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim, to:
IDEAL Industries Inc.
1375 Park Ave.
Sycamore, IL 60178 USA
Attn: General Counsel / Arbitration Notice
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. IDEAL will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. IDEAL will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
YOU AND IDEAL EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND IDEAL EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
