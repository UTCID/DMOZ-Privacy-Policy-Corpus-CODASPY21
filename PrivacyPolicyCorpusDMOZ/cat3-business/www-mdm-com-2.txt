TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT WE and our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, advertisers, partners, co-branders and sub-licensees and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU AND/OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PRIVACY, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SITES OR THE INFORMATION OR CONTENT ON THE SITES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IN THE EVENT OF FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR STRICT OR PRODUCT LIABILITY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY OR THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, advertisers, partners, co-branders and sub-licensees and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns TO YOU EXCEED, IN TOTAL, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US.
Exclusions and Limitations
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
No Resale of Sites/Content
Unless otherwise specified, you agree not to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sell, resell, exploit, transfer or transmit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Sites, information and content found in the Sites, use of the Sites, or access to the Sites.

You acknowledge that we may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Sites. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any information or content maintained or transmitted by the Sites. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to log off accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that we reserve the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice.
Termination
You agree that we may, at any time and at our sole discretion, with or without cause or any notice to you, terminate these Terms, your access to the Sites, and/or your Account, or suspend or block your access to the Sites. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Sites and out services may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

Dealings with Merchants; Links
Advertisements, offers, or links to other websites and resources of third-parties that we do not control may be found on or through the Sites. Such advertisements and information may or may not be or remain wholly accurate. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for (i) the availability or accuracy of such sites or resources; or (ii) the content, advertising, or products or services on or available from such sites or resources. The inclusion of any link through the Sites does not imply that we endorse the linked site. You use the links at your own risk. Our Privacy Policy is applicable only when you are using the Sites. Once you choose to link to another website, you should read and understand that website’s privacy policy before disclosing any personal information.
Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, third-party merchants or advertisers that are found on or through the Sites or which provide links on or through the Sites, including, for example, “click to purchase” and other similar programs, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such merchant or advertiser. You waive any claim against us, our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, and agree to hold us our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns harmless from any loss or damage of any kind incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such merchants or advertisers on or through the Sites.

You agree to keep your address current and that notice provided by us to the address that you have most recently provided will constitute effective notice.

If the law allows you to withdraw this consent or if we are ever required to deal with you non-electronically, we reserve the right to charge or increase fees and you agree to print or make an electronic copy of the Terms and any other contract or disclosure that we are required to provide to you.
Compliance with Laws. You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws, keeping in mind that access to the Sites by certain persons or in certain countries may not be legal.

If any part of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remainder will remain in full force and effect, provided that the allocation of risks described herein is given effect to the fullest extent possible.
No Assignment. These Terms are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign or delegate these Terms to anyone without our express written permission.

Choice of Law and Venue. These Terms and all performances and claims of every nature (including without limitation, contract, tort and strict liability) relating in any way to any aspect of the Sited will be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, USA, without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the law of a different jurisdiction.

Limitations on Actions. Any action concerning any dispute you may have with respect to the Sites must be commenced within one year after the dispute arises, or the cause of action is barred.
