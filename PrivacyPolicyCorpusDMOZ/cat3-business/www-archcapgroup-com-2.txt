Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how we use cookies on our website.  For almost any website to work properly, it needs to collect certain basic information on its users. Websites can obtain this data by users voluntarily choosing to submit certain information. However, many websites, including ours, may also use a variety of technologies, including through third parties, that access information already stored on your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone or smartphone (each a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our website. Cookies are one form of this technology that collect information to help us improve your online experience. This Cookie Policy also explains the different types of cookies we use, and how you can change or delete them.  Please also see our Privacy and Data Protection Policy here for further details about the ways in which we collect and use your personal data as well as other tracking technologies that may be used on the website.
We hope that this Cookie Policy helps you understand, and feel more confident about, our use of cookies on our website.
If you have any further queries, please contact us via email at: ArchDPO@archcapservices.com.
1. WHAT IS A COOKIE?
1.1 Cookies are text files with small amounts of information which are downloaded to the browser you use on your Device when you visit a website.
They are widely used in order to make websites work or work in a better, more efficient way.
Websites can read and write the files in a cookie, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (for example, by remembering your username on a login form).
We do this to understand your use of our website, improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content, and optimize our advertisements and marketing.
1.2 Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you do not want to allow cookies or only allow the use of certain types of cookies, please refer to your browser settings which should allow you to accept or deny cookies (see paragraph 3 below for browser-specific links that provide instructions on how to change these settings). You can control whether cookies are accepted by your browser at all or selectively choose which cookies you allow and which cookies you reject. You can also edit your browser options to choose not to receive cookies in the future or withdraw your consent to the use of cookies at any time or delete cookies that have already been set on your Device.  If you use more than one Device and/or browser, you will need to disable cookies on each Device and on each browser separately. Further information about the procedure to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider's website via your help screen. You may wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html for information on commonly used browsers. You should be able to find more in depth information about opting out of cookies on your browser settings menu.
1.3	Typically, cookies are classified into two types, either “session cookies” which do not stay on your Device after you close your browser or “persistent cookies” which will usually remain on your Device until you delete them or they expire.
We use both types of cookies on our website:
A) Session cookie
A session cookie is used each time you visit our website to give you a session ID.
We use this type of cookie to link your actions on our website.
Each session cookie will only last for the length of your browser session (each browser session will start when you open your browser window and finish when you close your browser window).
After your visit to our website, all session cookies are deleted. Each time you visit our website you will have a different session ID.
B) Persistent cookie
A persistent cookie has a longer lifetime than a session cookie and lasts for the period of time specified in the cookie (this will vary from cookie to cookie).
A persistent cookie will not be deleted when you close your browser window and will be activated every time you visit a website that placed the particular persistent cookie.
1.4 Cookies also have, broadly speaking, four different functions and can be categorized as follows: strictly necessary cookies, performance cookies, functionality cookies and targeting or advertising cookies. We only use strictly necessary cookies and performance cookies on our website.
2. WHICH COOKIES DO WE USE ON OUR WEBSITE?
We use two different categories of cookies on our website:
2.1
Strictly necessary cookies
These cookies are essential to our website and enable you to use certain features, such as remembering information you have entered on forms when you move onto other pages of our website.
If we did not use strictly necessary cookies, we may not be able to provide certain services to you and our website may not perform as intended. These strictly necessary cookies are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.
In some cases, we may use third parties to manage our strictly necessary cookies but we do not allow any third party to use these cookies other than for the specific purposes listed in this paragraph. Strictly necessary cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet.
2.2
Performance cookies
Performance cookies collect information about your use of our website and enable us to improve functionality and your user experience, as well as enable personalized features and content.  For example, performance cookies will show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our website, help us record any difficulties you have with our website and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. Performance cookies do not collect information to display targeted advertising on other websites.
Performance cookies do not collect information that identifies you individually, and all information that is collected by these cookies is aggregated and anonymized.
In some cases, we may use third parties to manage our performance cookies but we do not allow any third party to use these cookies other than for the purposes listed in this paragraph.
For example, we use Google Analytics, managed by Google Inc., to track website usage and activity.
The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, website improvement and performance metrics. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our website, how many customers log in (if applicable), when they visited, for how long and which areas of our website were visited.
This information is not used to identify you individually. You can find out more about how Google uses data when you use our website or apps at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
