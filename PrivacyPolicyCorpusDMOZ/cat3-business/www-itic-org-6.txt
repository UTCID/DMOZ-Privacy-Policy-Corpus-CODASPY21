Policy - U.S. National Security Policymaking
U.S. National Security Policymaking
Go Back
Protecting national security is the most important responsibility of governments. It is the foundation for political freedom, economic opportunity, and the rule of law, enabling companies to innovate, create jobs, and support the industrial base. In an increasingly digital world, technology and business are evolving in ways that make national security a truly shared responsibility between government and industry.
The global tech sector agrees that increased trade and innovation raise new types of national security risks and has a strong record of supporting national security. It is concerned, however, that the U.S. government is moving to address these very legitimate risks in ways that could create unintended negative consequences for U.S. competitiveness, technological leadership, and – ironically – national security.
It has never been more important for the U.S. government and global companies to work together, across the full spectrum of public and private technologies, to harness U.S. technological leadership, economic openness, and international engagement in order to strengthen national security.
ITI and our member companies support U.S. government efforts to find the right policies to address these new types of risks. Our Principles for Improved Policymaking and Enhanced Cooperation on National Security, Technology, and Trade aim to enable the U.S. government and global companies to work together, across the full spectrum of public and private technologies, to harness U.S. technological leadership, economic openness, and international engagement in order to strengthen national security.
These principles can serve as a roadmap for U.S. national security policymaking that focuses on targeted solutions, enhances cooperation between government and industry, and plays to the United States’ historical strengths in innovation, business, and international cooperation.
