WHAT IS MAP PRICING?AND WHY WE CAN'T ADVERTISE OUR "GUARANTEED LOWEST PRICES"As an Authorized Reseller for the major card printer manufacturers (Datacard, Fargo, Zebra and Evolis), we are required to follow their MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) Policy.This policy prohibits us from "advertising" any prices that are lower than MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price). As such, you must contact us directly (call or e-mail us) for your ACTUAL price. We can then provide you with your discounted price and setup your own password-protected Preferred Customer account which will allow you to view and order products at your discounted price.To receive the lowest prices, you can:Call Us:(714)922-1140Email Us:sales@IDCardPrinterSavings.comLogin:Click here to login*Instant Quote:For some manufacturers, you have the option of clicking on an "Email me a better price" link to immediately get a discounted price quote. Some manufacturers however, prohibit us from providing this option so this link may not appear on all MAP items.*If you do not already have an account, please contact us to setup a Preferred Customer account. This allows you to view and order products on-line at wholesale prices. Contact us via email, or phone us at (714)922-1140.
