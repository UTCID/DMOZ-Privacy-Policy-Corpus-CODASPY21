Any departure from this condition may lead to additional charges which the Buyer agrees to pay in full.10.3.1 The Buyer must make all arrangements necessary for the Buyer or the End User to take delivery of the Goods when the Seller delivers them, including providing labour and suitable unloading equipment for the unloading of delivered Goods. In the event that the Buyer or the End User asks for, and the delivery driver(s) agree to assist in offloading or to provide any other assistance not previously agreed between the Seller and the Buyer, the Buyer or the End User accept that any subsequent claims for (but not limited to) damages, loss (including loss of profit) or injury shall not involve the Seller.10.3.2 The Seller shall be entitled to assume that any person who both reasonably appears and claims to have authority to accept delivery and who signs a note in respect of the Goods on behalf of the Buyer or End User (if Seller has agreed to deliver direct) does in fact have the authority to do so.10.4 If the Buyer or End User does not accept delivery of Goods, or the Seller is unable to deliver, or is delayed in delivering Goods because of the Buyer or End Users actions or omissions, then the Seller may charge the Buyer who will be liable to pay the Seller for all costs incurred as a result.10.5 Where the Goods are to be delivered in instalments, each delivery shall constitute a separate contract and failure by the Seller to deliver any one or more of the instalments in accordance with these Conditions, or any claim brought by the Buyer in respect of any one or more instalments shall not entitle the Buyer to treat the Contract as a whole as repudiated.10.6 If the Seller fails to deliver the Goods for any reason other than any cause beyond the Seller’s reasonable control or the Buyer's fault, and the Seller is accordingly liable to the Buyer, the Seller’s liability shall be limited to;10.6.1 replacing those Goods not delivered; or10.6.2 issuing a credit note equal to the value (net of VAT) over the price of the Goods not delivered.10.6.3 the Seller shall not be liable for any consequential loss including (but not limited to) loss of profit.10.7 If the Buyer or End User fails to take delivery of the Goods, or fails to give the Seller adequate delivery instructions at the time stated for delivery (otherwise than by reason of any cause beyond the Buyer's reasonable control or by reason of the Seller’s fault) then, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to the Seller, the Seller may:10.7.1 Store the Goods until actual delivery and charge the Buyer for the reasonable costs (including but not limited to storage, re-delivery and Insurance of the Goods); or10.7.2 Sell the Goods at the best price readily obtainable and (after deducting all reasonable costs including the aforementioned storage, re-delivery and insurance costs and selling expenses) account to the Buyer for the excess over the price or charge the Buyer for any shortfall below the price under these Conditions.10.8 At the time of delivery the Buyer or End User must check that the quantity of Goods matches the quantity detailed on the Proof of Delivery (“POD”) and that the external packaging of the Goods is in good condition and has not been tampered with or damaged (this applies to any palletised or larger deliveries which may have been shrink or black wrapped.)10.9 Where visible external damage is apparent at the time of delivery the Buyer must either refuse the Goods or annotate the POD clearly with the word “DAMAGED”. The Buyer or End User must not sign the POD “unchecked”, “unexamined” or any such similar wording. The Buyer acknowledges that failure to comply with this clause shall void the Seller’s liability to either replace or issue a credit note at the price paid by the Buyer for any such damaged Goods.10.10 The Buyer must notify the Seller of any over-shipments no later than five (5) days from the date of delivery and agrees that failure to do so shall be deemed to be acceptance of the Goods and an invoice shall be raised accordingly by the Seller to the Buyer for the over-shipped Goods subject to Section 34 (2) of the Sales of Goods Act 1980 (as amended) if applicable.10.11 The Buyer must notify the Seller of under-shipments or missing Goods no later than two (2) working days from the date of delivery and agrees that failure to do so shall be deemed to be receipt of all Goods as indicated on the Delivery Note.10.12 It is the Buyer’s responsibility to notify the Seller of any incorrect Goods supplied within two (2) working days of delivery. If the Goods are not what the Buyer has ordered, the Buyer must not deface or open the manufacturer’s packaging or use the Goods. The Buyer agrees that failure to adhere to the conditions shall be deemed to be acceptance of the Goods and any and all monies owed relating to the Goods shall be due from the Buyer to the Seller.10.13 In the event of any End User delivery, the Buyer shall ensure that the End User complies with the Buyer’s obligations set out in this clause 10.10.14 A signed POD by or on behalf of the Buyer shall be conclusive evidence of delivery and (except where any damage or discrepancy is noted on the POD) that it was received in good order and condition and accordingly no claims shall be brought to the Seller in respect of the delivery claiming the contrary.11. TRANSIT LOSS & DAMAGE11.1 No Goods shall be deemed to be ‘Lost in Transit’ until seven (7) days from despatch have elapsed, and the Seller’s subsequent investigations of such claims have concluded that the Goods are (or are deemed to be) lost irrevocably. For the avoidance of doubt, where delivery has been made, and where the Buyer or End User have signed the POD as receiving all Goods, the Buyer must notify the Seller of any shortage no later than two (2) days after delivery in accordance with clause 10.11.11.2 Any claims brought against the Seller by the Buyer relating to “Damages in Transit” shall only be accepted where the Buyer or End User has annotated the POD with the word “DAMAGED” in accordance with clause 10.8 and having done so, has subsequently refused acceptance of the damaged Goods or, having accepted them, is storing the Goods safely at the delivery address as detailed on the invoice to avoid further damage arising.11.3 The Seller’s sole liability in the event of proven loss or damage will be limited to either;11.3.1 replacing the Goods with Goods of the same or similar specification and at the value equal to the invoice price paid by the Buyer (if requested by the Buyer to do so); or11.3.2 issuance of a credit note to the Buyer at the invoice price paid for the lost or damaged Goods including any applicable carriage charges which the Buyer may have paid.11.4 Credit notes issued by the Seller to the Buyer for Lost in Transit Goods may be reversed if after fourteen (14) days from issuance it is established that the Goods have been delivered. The Seller will notify the Buyer in this event, and the Buyer or their End User shall either:11.4.1 make the Goods available for collection by the Seller who will collect and return the Goods to their inventory so long as the goods are in the condition as set out in clause 12.2.2 ; or11.4.2 keep the Goods in which case clause 11.4 shall apply.12. RETURNS12.1 With the exception of Faulty or Damaged in Transit Goods as specified in clauses 9.3 & 10.9, the Seller will not accept any returns requests where the value of the Goods is eighty-five Euros (€85) or less, net of any applicable VAT. This applies to single and multi-Goods. The only exception shall be in the event of a proven error by the Seller, in which event the Seller’s sole liability shall be to issue a credit note to the Buyer for the price paid for the Goods in question. The Seller may (at their sole discretion) allow the Buyer to keep the Goods and issue the credit note without the need for the return of such Goods.
