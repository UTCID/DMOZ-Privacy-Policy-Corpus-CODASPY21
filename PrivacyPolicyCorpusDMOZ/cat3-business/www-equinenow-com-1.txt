Terms of Use
This website, equinenow.com, (the "Website") is a service of EquineNow.com, LLC
(“Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”). These Terms of Use, together with our Privacy Policy that is incorporated herein by
reference (together, the “Terms of Use”), are a legally binding agreement between you and EquineNow.com, LLC; please
read them carefully. By using the services offered on the Website or by continuing to view materials on the Website,
you are consenting to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy
available here, do not access or use the Website.
OUR SERVICES
Our desire is to create a comprehensive listing service by allowing users to post listings and also aggregating listings
from various websites to hopefully increase the likelihood that you find what you are looking for. However, the internet
has billions of users and so it is impossible for us to investigate each user and listing on our Website and on the websites
that aggregate listings to post on our Website, such as Oodle.com. Therefore, we highly recommend that you perform sufficient
due diligence before exchanging any money or goods based on any listing that you find on the Website. Please also review these
Terms of Use in their entirety, including the section about Buying and Selling below, to further understand EquineNow.com, LLC’s
involvement in the buying and selling process on the Website.
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR HARM THAT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
LOST INCOME, LOST PROPERTY, PERSONAL INJURY, OR DEATH.
We recommend that you review our post about Scams and Fraudulent
Transactions (click here) as one step towards protecting yourself on the Internet. The Company does not compensate buyers or sellers for any
losses that they may suffer as a result of using the Website.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
The Website is intended only for access and use by individuals at least eighteen (18) years old. If you are not at least eighteen
(18) years old, you are prohibited from both the access and usage of the Website. Since the Web is an evolving medium, EquineNow.com,
LLC may change the Terms of Use from time to time. By continuing to use the Website following our posting of such changes, you agree
to be bound by these Terms of Use, as modified. EquineNow.com, LLC may change, restrict access to, suspend, or discontinue this
Website, or any portion of this Website, at any time and without notice to you.
Although EquineNow.com, LLC cannot monitor all the ads posted to our Website, we reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to
delete, move, or edit any ads or other postings that come to our attention that we consider unacceptable or inappropriate, whether
for legal or other reasons. By using the Website you agree not to post or transmit any defamatory, abusive, obscene, threatening,
misleading, or illegal material, or any other material that infringes on the rights of others or interferes with the ability of others
to enjoy the Website. We retain the right to deny access to anyone who we believe has violated these Terms of Use or any other term of
this agreement.
BUYING AND SELLING
1. Transactions on the Website are between the Buyer and the Seller only; the Company is not involved in or responsible for sales or
purchases on the Website.
The Website is a classified ad search engine and listing service that brings together buyers and sellers. Information about a particular
item, animal or service is supplied by the seller, not by EquineNow.com, LLC. EquineNow.com, LLC will not be a party to any transaction
between a buyer and seller based upon information posted on the Website. At no time does EquineNow.com, LLC take title to any of the
goods or animals offered for sale on the Website or process any payments related to goods or animals offered for sale on the Website.
The price and other terms of any sale remain subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller. The prices listed by
sellers on the Website may exclude other charges which may be added to the listed price to arrive at the final price of a particular
item. All payments are handled directly between the buyer and the seller, and the Company will not provide any refunds or other
compensation for transactions relating to listings on the Website.
2. The Company does not guarantee or verify any information on the Website, so use caution and good judgment when transacting through
the Website.
The material that appears on this Website is for informational purposes only. Despite our efforts to provide useful and accurate
information, errors may appear from time to time. Before purchasing items, animals, or services you've read about on this Website,
you should confirm with the seller any information (including the price) that is important to your purchasing decision. EquineNow.com,
LLC is not responsible for, and does not guarantee, the condition, soundness, health, physical appearance, performance, or any other
aspect of any such animal, item or service or the accuracy, completeness, or content of any listing on the Website. We disclaim all
liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such information by you or any other visitor to the Website, or by
anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. Please be sure to review our Buyer/Seller Safety tips (link) prior to making any
payments or exchanging any information related to a listing on the Website.
Though we hope that all who come to this Website will act honorably and treat each other fairly, we can't verify the information
sellers supply or guarantee or warranty the products, animals, or services they offer. Nor can we assure the seller that the check
he/she gets from the buyer isn't going to bounce or the payment be fraudulent; cash payments are the most trustworthy. When using
this Website to find a buyer for your item, animal or service, or an item, animal or service you can buy, we urge you to use the
same common sense and good judgment you would use in selling or buying an item, service or animal through, or responding to, a
classified ad in the newspaper or other publication. There is no substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment. We
strongly suggest you obtain the services of a Veterinarian or other qualified individual, as applicable, to evaluate any animal or
item you are considering. Do not meet strangers in private locations or alone.
3. More information for Sellers.
When you place an ad on this Website, you must be prepared to sell the item, animal, or service in the ad at the price at which,
and the terms on which, you've listed it. You must have possession of the actual item or animal listed and the ability to transfer
ownership. To list an item, animal or service for sale on the Website, sellers are required to provide certain identifying and
contact information. You may not charge any potential buyer for information about any item, animal or service listed for sale on
the Website, nor may you use the Website to promote, without our prior written permission, any other Website, product or service.
EquineNow.com, LLC reserves the right to deny use of the Website to anyone who does not comply with these requirements or who
otherwise uses the Website in a manner we consider, in our sole discretion, inappropriate.
Responsibility for the information contained in ads lies with each seller. You alone are responsible for material you post and for
the content of all email messages transmitted through the Website. Nothing will undermine a user's confidence in the item you're
looking to sell faster than inaccurate statements or misleading representations about the item. Since any erosion of user confidence
in you is likely to be accompanied by erosion of user confidence in us, we care deeply about making sure that the information you
supply is accurate and that, in all respects, you treat Website users fairly and honorably.
Sellers are solely responsible for any taxes or fees resulting from use of the Website, including any sales arising out of the
Website.
4. The Company may remove users that do not comply with these Terms of Use, but it is not required to do so.
Though we don't monitor transactions that originate on the Website, we reserve the right to perform random quality assurance
tests to confirm that those who offer items, animals, or services for sale over the Website are prepared to sell the items,
animals, or services they advertise at the prices at which, and the terms on which, they advertise them. By placing an ad on
our Website, you agree to cooperate in any such random quality assurance tests. If our tests reveal, or we otherwise learn, that
a seller, in our sole discretion, is engaging or intends to engage, in unfair or deceptive practices, EquineNow.com, LLC reserves
the right to deny that seller use of this Website and our ad services.
5. Fees paid to the Company are nonrefundable.
By placing an Ad on our Website, you agree to pay the fees specified for the service you select, regardless of whether your item,
animal, or service sells as a result of the listing. Take care in selecting your Ad type and submitting your Ad information; listing
fees are not refundable, even if you provide erroneous information or fail to sell your animal, item or service.

REGISTRATION
To obtain access to certain services on the Website, you will be given an opportunity to register. As part of the registration
process, you will select a user name and a password. You agree that the information you supply during that registration process
will be accurate and complete and that you will not register under the name of, nor attempt to enter the service under the name of,
another person. We reserve the right to disallow use of user names that we deem offensive or inappropriate. You will be responsible
for preserving the confidentiality of your password and for all actions of persons accessing the Website through any username/password
assigned to you. You will notify EquineNow.com, LLC of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account.
LINKS TO OTHER SITES
For your convenience, this Website and/or its search feature will make available a variety of links to other websites that we don't
operate where you can find other items for sale that meet your search criteria. EquineNow.com, LLC is not responsible for the items,
animals, or services these vendors provide and has no control over these websites or listings. If you choose to purchase any item
