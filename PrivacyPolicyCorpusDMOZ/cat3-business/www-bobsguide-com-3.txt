Introduction
Our website uses cookies. We will ask you to consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy when you first visit our website. By using our website, you are agreeing to this policy, and you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.
About cookies
A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website. Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies.
A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date).
A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

Blocking cookies
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. For example:
in Internet Explorer (version 11) you can block cookies using the cookie handling override settings available by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy" and then "Advanced". Click on "Override Automatic Cookie Handling" and choose "Block"
in Firefox (version 56) you can block all cookies by clicking "Customise", "Options", "Privacy and Security", selecting "Use custom settings for history" from the History drop-down menu, and unticking "Accept cookies from sites"
in Chrome (version 61), you can block all cookies by accessing the "Customise and control Google Chrome" menu, and clicking "Settings", "Advanced" and "Privacy and Security" and "Content settings" and "Cookies", and then selecting "Block third-party cookies".
Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the features on this website.
Deleting cookies
You can also delete cookies already stored on your computer. For example:
in Internet Explorer (version 11), you must manually delete cookie files (you can find instructions for doing so at https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies;
in Firefox (version 56), you can delete cookies by clicking "Tools", "Options", "Privacy and Security" and then "Show Cookies", and then clicking "Remove All Cookies";
in Chrome (version 61), you can delete all cookies by accessing the "Customise and control Google Chrome" menu, and clicking "Settings", "Advanced" and "Privacy and Security" and "Content settings" and "Cookies", and under "All cookies and site data" select "Remove All"
Again, doing this may have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.
