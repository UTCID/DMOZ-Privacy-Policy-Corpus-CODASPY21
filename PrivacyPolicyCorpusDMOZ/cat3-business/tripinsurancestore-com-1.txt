TripInsuranceStore.com’s Committed To Your Privacy
Before we get to all the legal wording, TripInsuranceStore.com, Inc. wants you to know in simple English:
Steve, Deanna and Kim protect our clients’ privacy. One meaning of the word “client” is one who leans on another for protection. So if you want us to give out any information to someone else, we need your permission. If you say, “my friend is going to be calling…”, we need to get your friend’s name so when they call we know it’s ok.
On the other hand, if you are using TripInsuranceStore.com to gather information so you can bypass us when you order a travel insurance policy (meaning we lose the commission on the sale), this is fraudulent use of TripInsuranceStore.com.
We understand that not everyone who researches travel insurance ultimately buys it. But since the price for any specific policy is the same from every seller, please don’t steal our information when you know you won’t be ordering through us. The worst offenders are travel agents and our competitors.
This Privacy Policy describes the terms of TripInsuranceStore.com’s commitment to your privacy.

About The Personal Information This Website Collects And How It Is Used
This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers. This information is obtained in various ways, such as:
Visitor, Subscriber, Member, Or Customer Information Obtained From ‘Registration’
Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website. This can include pages or ‘pop ups’ where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, chat, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.
Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing. This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.

Online Ordering
Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.

Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions: one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any “submission” provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.
