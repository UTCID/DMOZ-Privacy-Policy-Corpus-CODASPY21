Integration of third party providersa) Use of Google Web FontsThis page uses so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. The Google Fonts are installed locally. There is no connection to Google servers.b) Links to social mediaIn our online media you will find links to the social networks •    Facebook, •    Twitter, •    YouTube in the form of so-called "social plug-ins". You can recognize the links by the respective logos of the providers.We use the so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our site, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug-ins. You can recognize the provider of the plug-in by the mark on the box above their initial letter or by the logo. We offer you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. The plug-in provider will receive the information that you have called up the corresponding website of our online service only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it. In addition, the data referred to above in this declaration will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, for example, the IP address is made anonymous immediately after collection, according to information provided by the respective provider in Germany. Thus, by activating the plug-in, your personal data is transmitted to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers in the USA). Since the plug-in provider collects data in particular via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies via your browser’s security settings before clicking on the grayed-out box.We have no influence on the collected data and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full scope of data collection, the purposes of processing, the storage periods. We also do not have any information on the deletion of the collected data by the plug-in provider.The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or to better tailor their services to clients’ needs. Such an evaluation (that also includes users who are not logged in) is carried out in particular to display demand-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles. If you want to exercise this right, please contact the respective plug-in provider. By using plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of plug-ins is Article 6 section 1 s. 1 lit. f) of the GDPR. The data transfer takes place regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected by us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you press the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and communicates it publicly to your contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this allows you to avoid being assigned to your profile by the plug-in provider.You can obtain further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing by the plug-in provider in the following privacy policies of these providers. There you will also find further information on your rights in this matter and setting options to protect your privacy.If you activate a social plug-in, it remains active until you either deactivate it or delete your cookies.Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing of the respective provider can be found in the corresponding privacy policy.
