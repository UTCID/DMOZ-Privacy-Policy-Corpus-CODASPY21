GreenState Credit Union and Your Personal Information
What does GreenState Credit Union do with your personal information?

GreenState Credit Union
What We Do
How does GreenState protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
How does GreenState collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
open an account or apply for a loan
deposit money or use your credit or debit card
provide account information.
We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies
Why can’t I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only
sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes-information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account - unless you tell us otherwise.
