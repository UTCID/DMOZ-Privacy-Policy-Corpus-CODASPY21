Can’t find exactly what you’re looking for? A custom display for your upcoming trade show could be just what you need.

Rentals
Rental Galleries
Are you ready for your next trade show? If you’re heading out for your first one, you may find that you have little of the necessary supplies to make an impressive display. Maybe you’re preparing for another trade show after several successful ones, and you want to change your display to draw more attention or fit a new booth size. Rather than buying everything you need, Godfrey Group makes it easier with our rental trade show booth options.
Trade show booth rental allows you to rent the components for impressive trade show displays. Please scan through some of our custom rental display examples below, viewable by booth size. This is not a comprehensive catalog of all of our rental exhibits, but rather some of our most popular designs. Our rentals are turnkey, including round trip shipping, installation, dismantle, graphics, lighting, etc.
If you see something that fits your rental needs, contact Godfrey Group or call (800) 789-9394 to learn more about our rental process.
