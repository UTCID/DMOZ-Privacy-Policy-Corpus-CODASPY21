The website implements the following "notice and takedown" procedure upon receipt of any notification of claimed copyright infringement. The website reserves the right at any time to disable access to, or remove any material or activity accessible on or from any page on the website or any materials claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. It is the firm policy of the website to terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers, when appropriate, and the website will act expeditiously to remove access to all material that infringes on another's copyright, according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C. §512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").
The website's DMCA Notice Procedures are set forth in the preceding paragraph. If the Notice does not comply with §512 of the DMCA, but does comply with three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing according to §512 of the DMCA, the website shall attempt to contact or take other reasonable steps to contact the complaining party to help that party comply with the notice requirements. When the Designated Agent receives a valid Notice, the website will expeditiously remove and/or disable access to the infringing material and shall notify the affected user. Then, the affected user may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement made under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed because of misidentification of the material. After the Designated Agent receives the counter-notification, it will replace the material at issue within 10-14 days after receipt of the counter-notification unless the Designated Agent receives notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining party seeking an injunction against the infringing activity. The website reserves the right to modify, alter or add to this policy, and all users should regularly check back to these Terms of Use to stay current on any such changes.
