Like most websites, we use cookie information to improve the efficiency of customer service, allow Members to easily change addresses, and to add or cancel memberships by automatically verifying that you are a Member. We also use cookies to enhance the Website’s content by compiling aggregate information about what specific sections and pages that users visit. Cookies may also be placed by third parties when you click-through from the Website to an advertisement or otherwise link to a website maintained by a third party. Though we may encourage third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy practices, we are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties and you should review them carefully before providing any personally identifying information to such parties.
