Test Goes Here
CLOSE
Innovation
Innovation fabric is designed for the highest hills and tallest mountains.
Developed to be the last word in high end waterproof/breathable performance fabric, the Innovation range is most often found in combination with our System Dual Protection technology due to its ideal compatibility and usability.
A texturised nylon laminate coated with hydrophilic PU fabric; highly breathable and wickable with excellent waterproofing, Innovation 5 is used in our System Dual Protection range.
CLOSE
Ventile
Originally designed in the UK, Ventile® is densely woven from 100% cotton using the world’s finest long staple fibre.
Ventile® is not coated or laminated yet the combination of the dense weave and the swelling properties of the fibres when wet provide excellent weatherproofing.
It is an entirely natural product that offers a unique level of comfort, look and feel as well as being windproof, highly breathable, very durable and quiet.
Ventile® fabrics are used in some of the world’s finest outerwear performance garments and have military, medical and workwear applications. What’s more, they look great!
The long pedigree of the fabric goes back as far as the late 1930’s. With war looming, the British government thought that there would be a shortage of flax that was used in those days for fire hoses and water buckets. An alternative was required and research was commenced into the use of cottons, woven in such a way as to keep water in ! And it worked.
The requirements for research though changed during World War II. Britain depended upon convoys carrying vital supplies, but our Russian convoys across the Arctic Ocean were particularly susceptible to attack from submarines and long – range bombers. Home based RAF fighter escort cover was impossible because of distance.
So, Winston Churchill promoted the concept of catapulting expendable Hurricane aircraft from the decks of merchant ships to provide local cover. There was no means of landing back on the deck. The pilot had the choice of ditching the aircraft or bailing out into the sea. There was no problem in spotting the pilots who had signals and lights, but the water was so cold that life expectancy was only a few minutes. Most died from exposure.
There was an urgent need for a new, protective clothing fabric that would be comfortable in the cockpit under combat conditions and that would also keep a pilot warm and dry in the sea. After many trials, the scientists at the Shirley Institute in Manchester U.K. developed the fabric called ‘Ventile’. When made into finished garments, life expectancy in the sea was extended from a few minutes to 20 minutes and rescue was now a real possibility. 80% of anti-submarine pilots who fell into the sea now survived.
Ventile® fabrics for RAF clothing went into mass production in 1943 and the military association still remains today. Garment designs have changed over the years but you will still find Ventile® suits in modern Tornado jets with the RAF and other NATO airforces.

ViralOff
Polygiene started in the care segment during the fight against SARS in 2004 – while Viral-Off is particularly relevant in the current CV19 situation, it will also be a longer term solution to enhance hygiene even once the pandemic has settled down.
ViralOff is not intended to prevent disease, it is used for the protection of the treated product
Does it help against all viruses?
The active ingredient has been tested against Influenza A, BirdFlu, Norovirus and Corona (SARS) over the years, and in all cases, has achieved 99% levels of reduction.
The ISO18184:2019 is a standard test for the determination of the antiviral activity of textile products in a two-hour timespan, where it has to reduce the virus by 99%, to pass. This test uses viruses of the Influenza A strain.
How long does it last?
It is a durable and always-on treatment. For best performance and sustainability, wash less and only when needed.
CLOSE
Insect Shield
Every day, millions of people are exposed to insects that can carry malaria, Dengue fever, trypanosomiasis, fi lariasis, leishmaniasis, and other dangerous diseases.
Insect Shield’s long-lasting clothing treatment — proven to last through 70 washings on apparel and 25 washings on gear — is a vital solution for people living in harm’s way.
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported insect borne illness in the United States, and has now become one of the fastest growing epidemics to date, while Malaria is responsible for approximately one million deaths worldwide.
Insect Shield technology converts clothing and gear into long-lasting, effective and convenient insect protection.
The active ingredient in Insect Shield, permethrin, is so tightly bonded to the fabric fibers that it retains effective repellency through the expected life of the product.
Permethrin is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring repellent found in certain types of chrysanthemum plants such as the African Daisy.
The insecticide properties of chrysanthemums have been known for decades. Permethrin affects the nervous system in insects when they come in contact with it.
Permethrin is effective against a number of pesky and potentially dangerous insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, ants, flies chiggers and midges including those that can carry dangerous diseases such as malaria, dengue fever or Lyme.
CLOSE
CADS
Years of research and development into base layer fabrics has helped us to achieve Carbonised Active Dispersal System (CADS) – the ultimate wickable fabric base layer.
The specially constructed yarn network rapidly draws moisture away from the body and disperses it over a large area for fast evaporation into the surrounding atmosphere. Its super-fast wicking and high breathability rate works with the human body to keep the wearer dry and comfortable 100% of the time.Being Anti-Microbial enables it to eliminate odours being emitted from the wearer while offering a higher standard of hygiene.
Perfect for use on its own in warm weather or as part of a layering system in colder climates, CADS is the next step in performance fabrics next to the skin.
CLOSE
ADS Technology
Keela’s Active Dispersal System (ADS) is the ultimate moisture management system.
Its specially structured star yarn rapidly removes moisture away from the body, dispersing it over a large area for fast evaporation into the outside atmosphere, keeping you drier for longer.
The moisture management is inherent in the manufactured construction and cannot be washed out, ensuring it lasts the lifetime of the garment.
ADS also protects from the sun’s harmful rays and has a UV protection level of +40.
ADS works in harmony with your body, providing maximum comfort during periods of high activity outdoor sports.
Keela’s ADS garments are perfect for use worn individually in warm weather or as a base layer in conjunction with a layering system in colder environments.
ADS Thermal is the ideal thermal control layer for active use.
Constructed from our ADS star yarn fabric with an added layer of thin fleece on the inside, ADS Thermal is excellent at heat generation without the bulk of a fleece yet is highly breathable.
CLOSE
Merino
We use two different Merino mixes, a 100% Merino which has all of the natural Merino qualities, as well as an 80-20 Merino mix, which gives an increased durability.
Merino wool is a natural fibre which is produced by various species of merino sheep.
Many associate wool products to be irritable and rough against the skin, however, Merino is well known for its warmth and soft feel against the skin, and is regarded as one of the best options for use in baselayers.
What type of clothing contains Merino Wool?
Merino wool can be used for various types of clothing, due to its natural properties to insure a warm soft fit against the skin.
Similarly Merino works in the same manner as a micro-fleece as the fibre is able to trap and disperse the necessary amount of heat.
CLOSE
Primaloft
PrimaLoft is incredibly soft, lightweight and breathable with excellent water repellency so you remain dry, warm and comfortable, even under the most extreme conditions.
Ounce for ounce as warm as down, Primaloft microfibres are similar in size and shape to down, resulting in nearly equal insulating performance when dry and even better when wet.
Because its individual fibres are water repellent, Primaloft retains much of its ability to keep you warm, even when moisture has soaked through.
Primaloft Gold Active is designed to regulate your comfort level during intense activity, while offering performance without compromise in a wide range of conditions.
Similar to the structure of down with incredible softness, Primaloft is highly compressible and easy to stuff.
Its resilient fibres are quick to regain their loft to provide uncompromising insulation.
Primaloft insulation is soft and supple like down, making it an excellent choice for active outerwear.
It allows unrestricted movement and its light weight makes it comfortable for extended wear.
CLOSE
AirXtream is a specially developed 3-layer material concept.
The outer consists of a pique weave with a durable water resistant treatment laminated onto a waterproof hydrophilic membrane.
This in turn is laminated to the inner liner, which has rapid moisture wicking properties.
Airxtreme Advanced is designed to minimise the number of layers needed to insulate and protect against extreme elements.
Used as part of a layering system or alone as an outershell, the durable water repellent finish repels rain and snow while the tight weave gives excellent windproofing.
The textured brushed lining provides a comfortable insulating inner and the inherent stretch provides ease of movement.
CLOSE
AirXtream
AirXtream is a specially developed 3-layer material concept.
The outer consists of a pique weave with a durable water resistant treatment laminated onto a waterproof hydrophilic membrane.
This in turn is laminated to the inner liner, which has rapid moisture wicking properties.
AirXtream has a high percentage of stretch for added comfort while still retaining its durability. Its weatherproofing means it can be used for longer on its own when the weather turns bad and acts as the perfect mid layer in colder conditions, reducing bulk while still helping to retain insulation.
A combination of materials brought together in one performance system. The outer woven stretch component is treated with a highly durable water repellent finish and then bonded to a hydrophilic membrane.
The final component is the lining; this ‘Air Channel Matrix’ system minimizes contact with inner clothing or skin and allows for an increased air gap, helping to improve the overall performance of the layering system and reducing condensation without constraining body movement.
CLOSE
System Dual Protection
SDP was originally developed for use in Military applications, and has gone on to be used by Tactical Forces, Mountain Rescue and Emergency Services requiring performance clothing that works as hard as they do.
It has become a popular choice with the outdoor community and has been used to conquer the world’s toughest mountain summits and survive the harshest Arctic conditions.
In recognition of SDP’s success, Keela was awarded the Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation, one of the UK’s most prestigious awards, which recognizes outstanding achievement in the categories of international trade, innovation and sustainable development. Keela are grateful for the recognition of their innovations and continue to further develop System Dual Protection to ensure our customers know they can face the elements with confidence and in comfort.
Just like condensation on a window or in your car, your jacket can build up moisture on the inside.
You’ve seen it before, you find your new jacket has moisture inside after a good half hour of physical exertion.
But why?
Although it may look and feel as though your jacket is letting in water, the moisture is in fact caused by condensation building up inside.
Think about your car windscreen on a cold day… fogging up due to the temperature difference between the inside and the outside  here force ventilation is needed to clear the moisture.
Just like that, no waterproof garments breathe in wet or old conditions, no matter what marketing hype may tell you. Breathability claims can be made, but with the international test standards being set in dry conditions at 21°C and above, the results are far removed from the conditions in which we expect our products to perform.
