Except where prohibited, by accessing or using the PSA Platform or Services, you agree that any and all questions, controversies, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of these Terms and Conditions shall be resolved exclusively by means of arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in Denver, Colorado, and shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action or representative action, and you agree that you shall not seek to aggregate any claims with other individuals. For clarity, you agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the enforceability of these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions are unconscionable, void, or voidable.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules of the State of Colorado or of any other jurisdiction. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three per party and shall be held within twenty days of the making of a request. Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrators, and for good cause shown. Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of seven hours duration. Time is of the essence for any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions and arbitration hearings shall take place within ninety (90) days of filing and awards rendered within one hundred twenty (120) days. The Arbitrator shall agree to these limits prior to accepting appointment. The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages. The prevailing party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees.

The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness. In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any claim, action, or dispute relating to the ownership of IP be submitted to arbitration. Those who choose to access the PSA Platform do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, any applicable local laws.
16. GENERAL PROVISIONS
The provisions of these Terms and Conditions, which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions, shall so survive such termination until performed.
These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE PSA PLATFORM OR SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.
No waiver by us of any term or condition set out in these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of PSA to assert a right or provision under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and if such provision is determined to be
invalid or unenforceable nonetheless, the provision shall be deemed to be severable from the remainder of these Terms and Conditions and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of these Terms and Conditions.
