Covid-19 Pandemic resources to help keep your people safe.
Attorney Referral Service
If you have a legal issue involving matters other than liability, insurance, legal risk management, or a potential lawsuit against your ministry, our referral service may be of assistance.
Brotherhood Mutual's Attorney Referral Service will provide contact information for attorneys in your area who are members of the Christian Legal Society, the nation's largest Christian legal association.
You are under no obligation to use a referred attorney. You are responsible to assess the credentials of any attorney you choose to consult with or hire.
You may submit an attorney referral request free of charge.  However, should you decide to retain a CLS attorney, you will be charged for the legal services provided.
California Residents: By submitting this form, you will be providing Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company with personal information such as your name, job title, email address and phone number. Brotherhood Mutual may use this information to locate and provide you with the contact information of attorneys in your area that are members of the Christian Legal Society. To learn more about how we use your personal information, view our Privacy Notice for California Consumers.
