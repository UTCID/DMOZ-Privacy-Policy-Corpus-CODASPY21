Except as stated already, Turtle will make no attempt to identify individual users.

These entities may be in a position to identify the client computer equipment used to access a page. Such monitoring would be done by the provider of network services and is beyond the responsibility or control of InterAct.
Turtle will make no attempt to track or identify individual users, except where there is a reasonable suspicion that unauthorised access to systems is being attempted. In the case of all users, Turtle reserves the right to attempt to identify and track any individual who is reasonably suspected of trying to gain unauthorised access to computer systems or resources operating as part of Turtle web services.
As a condition of use of this site, all users must give permission for Turtle to use its access logs to attempt to track users who are reasonably suspected of gaining, or attempting to gain, unauthorised access.
All log file information collected by Turtle is kept secure and no access to raw log files is given to any third party.
