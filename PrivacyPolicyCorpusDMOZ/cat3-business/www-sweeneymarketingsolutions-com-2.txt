What do we do with the data we collect?
RSM uses the collected data for various purposes:
We collect user data via cookies and other means for the purposes of providing and maintaining the Site, enhancing your use of the site, and monitoring the usage of our Site to detect, prevent and address technical issues
We collect user data via cookies and other means for the purpose of analysis so we can improve our Site and our marketing efforts
We collect your personal contact information, such as name, email and phone number, via form submissions for the purposes of responding to specific inquiries and communicating with you, only in the ways you have requested
We collect information about your company and its needs via form submissions for the purpose of determining whether your company could benefit from our services and analyzing our marketing efforts
If you provide us with your Personal Data, and agree to this Notice, we may correlate the Personal Data you provide with previously obtained, anonymous site usage data. We may also correlate, store and analyze other publicly available data related to the email address you provided us, such as the name, industry, or size of the Company associated with it, in order to better understand our site visitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Legal Basis for Processing
RSM relies on your explicit consent for the majority of our data collection and processing. In those cases of data collection where another legal basis is used, an explanation of the appropriate legal basis is given for that particular data collection point.
What happens if you don’t give us your data
You can visit our website without giving us your personal data.  Much of the information on our website is available even to those who to whom we do not provide services.  If we are providing you with services pursuant to a contract with you, some personal information is necessary so that we can supply you with the services you have purchased or requested, and to authenticate you so that we know it is you and not someone else.
Retention of Data
RSM will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Notice. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
RSM will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes, as outlined in the Use of Data.
Transfer Of Data
Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it there.
RSM will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Notice and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.  Please note that the United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Therefore, we rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR.  In particular, we collect and transfer to the U.S. personal data only with your consent or to perform a contract with you. We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice.  We also minimize the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive information about you.
Security Of Data
Neither we, nor our Service Providers, will ever ask you for sensitive data, such as Credit Card information.
Non-sensitive details (your email address, etc.) are transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.  To help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information you transmit through use of this Site, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees’ privacy responsibilities.
How you can access, update,  transport, or delete your information?
RSM  aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.  Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to your requests to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.
If access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, we will provide you with a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.
If you wish to be informed what Personal Data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us by email at info@rightsourcemarketing.com, or by writing to 11718 Bowman Green Drive, Suite 200, Reston, VA 20190.
In certain circumstances, you have the right, at no cost to you:
To access and receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you
To rectify any Personal Data held about you that is inaccurate
To request the deletion of Personal Data held about you
You have the right to data portability for the information you provide to RSM. You can request to obtain a copy of your Personal Data in a commonly used electronic format so that you can manage and move it.
You may also request information about: the purpose of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; who else outside of RSM might have received the data from RSM; what the source of the information was (if you didn’t provide it directly to RSM); and how long it will be stored.
Additionally, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority or supervisory authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal data.
Who has access to your information?
We will never sell or rent your information to third parties.
