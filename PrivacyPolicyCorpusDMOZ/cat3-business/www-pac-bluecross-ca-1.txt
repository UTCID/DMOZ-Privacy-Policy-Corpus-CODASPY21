Protecting your Privacy
Pacific Blue Cross is committed to protecting the privacy of our members and their dependents. For over 70 years we have diligently protected our members' information.
Our privacy protection practices are compliant with both the provincial and federal privacy laws, which balance the right of individuals to protect their personally-identifiable information with the need of organizations to collect, use, disclose, and retain personally-identifiable information for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.
The information here will keep you informed about our privacy protection practices, our reasons for collecting your information and how we meet the requirements of the legislation.

Why do we collect your information?
When you first join us as a member or dependent under a group or individual plan we ask you for some information. We use this information to:
establish your identification
verify your eligibility for benefits and services
process and pay your claims
protect you, us, and your employer/plan sponsor, from error, misrepresentation and fraud
assist us in complying with legal requirements
understand your needs and preferences
We may also collect your information for these same purposes from other organizations that you are covered with such as your provincial medical plan or another benefit carrier.

When do we disclose your information?
We may disclose a member or dependent's information to another Blue Cross organization if they provide services on our behalf for individuals who reside outside British Columbia. Any such disclosure is made confidentially and the information is used by the Blue Cross organization to determine eligibility for coverage and to pay claims.
We may disclose a member or dependent's information to a health care professional when necessary to assess benefit or product eligibility.
We may disclose a member or dependent's information to an auditor sent by the member's employer to review that our procedures and claims processing is in accordance with our contractual obligation. The auditor will see only the information on members and dependents under that employer's plan(s), and not information on any other employer's members. In such situations we require the auditor to sign a confidentiality agreement to protect the privacy of this information.
In the event one of our members, or their dependents, is covered by a second benefit plan with another benefit carrier, we may disclose his/her relevant information to the benefit carrier when we are coordinating benefit payments between our organizations. This is in accordance with our contractual obligation.
We may share a member or dependent's information between Pacific Blue Cross and Blue Cross Life Insurance Company of Canada if the person has benefits with both organizations.
We may disclose a member or dependent's information to a person who seeks the information as an authorized representative (e.g. lawyer) of the member or dependent.
We may disclose a member or dependent's information to the employer or plan sponsor when required by our contractual obligations under the benefit plan; for example, for the purpose of investigation, prevention and reporting of plan abuse and/or fraud.
We may disclose a member or dependent's information when required or permitted by law. We limit the information that we release to only what is allowed or required by the relevant legislation.
We do not sell personal information or customer lists to other companies.
