Privacy and Security
Effective Date: 04/01/2018
At Amica, our customers are our number one priority. We respect the personal information of our customers and work hard to keep it secure and private by consistently reviewing and monitoring our practices.
An important component of our policies includes protecting all nonpublic personal information (NPI), collected through the application process or transactions with our customers. This includes data such as names, addresses, driving history and credit information. Our use of NPI is limited to supporting our customers' insurance product needs and to servicing policies and claims.
