About Us
Sayler Legal Service is proud to serve Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara Counties. We have been providing professional legal services since August 1991.
Our corporate office is located in Monterey, California and is central to all points throughout California’s central coast. We are proud to provide professional service to our clients, and as a small business on the beautiful Monterey Bay, we are proud to be a staple within our community — we work where we live.
We are affiliated with a large network of legal services professionals who provide services nationally and statewide. In order to provide the most effective solutions, we stay connected to our “sisters” by attending various training seminars, including the Annual California Conference of CALSPro, various state bar association meetings, legal secretaries meetings and other professional industry meetings. These conferences and seminars allow our staff to address the needs of our clients and stay current on legislation that affects our industry.
Our Leadership Team
Stephanie Sayler, Founder/CEO.
Stephanie entered the attorney support industry in 1981 in San Luis Obispo. She left the legal services industry to pursue other professional and personal initiatives including receiving a Bachelor of Science degree from California Polytechnic (Cal-Poly) University at San Luis Obispo in International Business and a minor in Wine Marketing from Cal Poly. After receiving her degree, she grabbed the golden ring of entrepreneurial spirit and opened Sayler Legal Service, Inc. to provide professional legal services. Her hobbies include traveling, mountain and road biking, snow-skiing and boarding, sailing, hiking, reading and learning the French language.
