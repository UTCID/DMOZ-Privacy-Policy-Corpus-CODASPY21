COVID-19, effective 11/1/2020
Onset continues to monitor the latest coronavirus developments and guidance from local authorities, the Centers for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization. The health and well-being of our customers, suppliers, employees, and the surrounding community is of the utmost importance to us, so we are taking the necessary precautions to keep everyone safe.
At this time, Onset’s ability to build our products and ship them to our customers as scheduled has not been affected by the coronavirus situation. We are taking proactive measures to work with our suppliers to identify and mitigate any potential supply chain disruptions and will continue to provide updates in the future, as needed.
