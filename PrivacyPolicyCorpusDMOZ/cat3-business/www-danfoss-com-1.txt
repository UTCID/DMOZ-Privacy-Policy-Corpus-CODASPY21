Privacy policy
Danfoss respects your privacy. Whether you are buying one of Danfoss' quality products, or just browsing the Danfoss websites, Danfoss wants to make you comfortable with our privacy policy and the security measures that we take to protect your personal data.
For that reason, Danfoss has implemented a set of Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), introducing a global standard of data protection requirements to be complied with by all Danfoss entities. The BCRs have been approved by the European data protection agencies and establish the foundation for Danfoss’ processing of personal data.
If you provide Danfoss with personal data or we collect personal data about you from other sources, Danfoss will treat it in accordance with this policy which also contains the primary contents of the Danfoss BCRs. Danfoss encourages you to read this privacy policy in full.

Danfoss is a global organisation with entities across the world.

However, in order to pursue the purposes listed above in section 3, we may share your personal data with other Danfoss group entities either to carry out a task as instructed by the data controller (recipient acting as data processor) or to pursue a legitimate purpose of its own (recipient acting as individual data controller) provided that such making available or disclosure of your personal data is not restricted by law.
