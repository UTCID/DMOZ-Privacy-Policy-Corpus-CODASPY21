How we handle your personal information.
1. About us
Finconnect (Australia) Pty Ltd ABN 45 122 896 477 Trading as “eChoice” provides Mortgage Broking services to consumers and Aggregation services to Finance Brokers and other intermediaries. This policy describes how your personal information is handled by us.
Finconnect provide Mortgage Broking, Aggregation and other services. Finconnect must follow the Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
In this policy, “we”, “us” or “our” means Finconnect.
In addition to the Privacy Act, individuals located in the European Union (EU) may also have rights under EU based rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR has harmonised the data privacy laws of each individual EU country, giving more rights to individuals located in the EU and more obligations to organisations holding their personal information.
Details of additional rights of individuals located in the EU and how we meet them are outlined in Appendix 1.
We take privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring the protection of your personal information, no matter where you are located.
2. Your privacy is important to us
We protect your information and aim to be clear and open about what we do with it. You can find more information in places like our application forms and terms and conditions.
We understand that your privacy is important to you, and we value your trust. That’s why we protect your information and aim to be clear and open about what we do with it. This policy explains how we handle your personal information. It also includes:
Our policy on the handling of credit reports and other credit information
Key information about credit reporting matters (see Section 6).
During your relationship with us, we may tell you more about how we handle your information — for example, when you fill in an application or receive terms and conditions. You should always read these documents carefully.
Sometimes we update our privacy policy. You can always find the most up-to-date version on this page.
3. What information do we collect?
We collect information about you when you use our products or services, or deal with us. We may also collect information about you from other people and organisations.
Information we collect from you
We collect personal information about you when you contact us, use our products or services, visit our websites or use our technology platforms or deal with us in some other way.
The information we collect from you may include:
Information about your identity — including your name, address, date of birth, gender and marital status
Your Tax File Number or tax residency status
Financial and transaction information
Information about your qualifications and employment history.
When you visit our website, or use our technology platforms and mobile applications — your location information, IP address and any third- party sites you access.
Other personal information, such as details of your interactions with us. We also record phone calls for quality and training purposes. If you do not wish for your call to be recorded, please let your consultant know at the time of the call.
Information we collect from others
We collect information about you from others, such as:
Service providers
Agents
Advisers
Brokers
Employers
Companies or bodies that you own shares in or have an interest in
Family members
For example, if you apply for credit, we may ask a credit reporting body for your credit report. We may also collect information about you that is publicly available (for example, in public registers or on social media) or provided by businesses we deal with.
Sensitive information
The Privacy Act protects your sensitive information — such as information about your religion, ethnicity, health or biometrics (for example, your fingerprints). If we need this type of information, we’ll ask for your permission — except where otherwise allowed by law.
4. How do we use your information?
We’re careful about how we use your information. We use it to deliver our products and services. We also use your information for other reasons, such as to better understand you and your needs, and to let you know about other products and services you might be interested in.
We collect, use and exchange your information so we can:
Confirm your identity.
Assess your application for a product service.
Assess any applications to become a Finconnect Mortgage Broker, Referrer or business supplier.
Design, manage, price and provide our products and services.
Manage our relationship with you.
Minimise risks and identify or investigate fraud and other illegal activities.
Contact you, for example, when we need to tell you something important.
Improve our service to you and your experience with us.
Comply with laws, and assist government or law enforcement agencies.
Manage our businesses.
We may also collect, use and exchange your information for other reasons where the law allows or requires us.
Bringing you new products and services
From time to time, we may also use your information to tell you about products or services we think you might be interested in. To do this, we may contact you by:
Email
Phone
SMS
Social media
Advertising through our apps, websites, or third-party websites
Mail
If you don’t want to receive direct marketing messages or want to change your contact preferences, email info@eChoice.com.au.
Using data to give you better customer service
We’re always working to improve our products and services and give you the best customer experience.
New technologies let us combine information we have about you and our other customers, for example transaction information, with data from other sources, such as third-party websites or the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We analyse this data to learn more about you and other customers, and how to improve our products and services.
We sometimes use this combined data to help other businesses better understand their customers. When we do, we don’t pass on any personal information about you.
5. Who do we share your information with?
We may share your information with others for the reasons mentioned in Section 4.
We may also share your information with third parties for the reasons in Section 4 or where the law otherwise allows. These third parties can include:
Prospective funders or other intermediaries in relation to your finance requirements.
Service providers — for example, mortgage insurers, loyalty program partners and our product distributors
Businesses who do some of our work for us — including direct marketing, statement production, debt recovery and IT support
Brokers, agents, advisers and people who act on your behalf — such as your parent (if you are under 14), guardian, or a person with Power of Attorney
Guarantors and other security providers
Organisations involved in our funding arrangements — like loan purchasers, investors, advisers, researchers, trustees and rating agencies
People who help us process claims — like assessors and investigators
Other banks and financial institutions — for example, if we need to investigate any disputes or complaints
Auditors, insurers and re-insurers
Current or previous employers — for example, to confirm your employment
Government and law enforcement agencies or regulators
Credit reporting bodies and credit providers
Organisations that help identify illegal activities and prevent fraud
Other people (like cardholders) using the same account
Any other person or entity, where you have provided us consent
Sending information overseas
Sometimes, we may send your information overseas, including to:
India.
Service providers or third parties who store data or operate outside Australia.
Comply with laws, and assist government or law enforcement agencies.
If we do this, we make sure there are arrangements in place to protect your information.
6. Checking your credit history
If you ask us for credit assistance, we may check your credit reports. We get these from credit reporting bodies. We also share your credit information with them so they can provide credit reports to others.
When you apply to us for credit assistance, we may need to check your credit reports.
A credit report gives us information about your credit history. Credit reports are provided by credit reporting bodies, who collect and share credit information with credit providers like us, and other service businesses like phone companies.
The Privacy Act limits the information we can give to credit reporting bodies, and that they can give us. The Act also limits how we can use credit reports.
The information we can share with credit reporting bodies includes:
Your identity
Type and amount of credit you have — like credit cards, home loans, or personal loans
How much you’ve borrowed
If you’ve made all your repayments
If you’ve committed fraud or another serious credit infringement.
Credit reporting bodies include this information in their reports to assist other credit providers to assess your credit worthiness.
We can also ask credit reporting bodies to give us your overall credit score, and may use credit information from credit reporting bodies together with other information to arrive at our own scoring of your ability to manage credit.
The credit reporting bodies we use are Equifax Pty Ltd, you can download a copy of their privacy policies at:
www.equifax.com.au/privacy
What do we do with credit information?
We use information from credit reporting bodies to:
Confirm your identity
Assess your credit applications
Assess your ability to manage credit
Manage our relationship with you
We keep your credit information with your other information. You can view this information or ask us to correct it if it’s wrong (see Section 8) or make a complaint to us (see Section 9).
Other rights you have
Direct Marketing — Credit providers like us can ask credit reporting bodies to use your credit information to pre- screen you for direct marketing purposes, but you can tell credit reporting bodies not to (see Section 10).
Preventing identity fraud — If you think you have been or could be a victim of fraud — for example, if someone else may be using your name to apply for credit — you can ask the credit reporting body not to use or give anyone your credit information.
7. Keeping your information safe
Our staff are trained in how to keep your information safe and secure. We use secure systems and buildings to hold your information. We aim to only keep your information for as long as we need it.
We store your hard copy and electronic records in secure buildings and systems, or using trusted third parties. Here are some of the things we do to protect your information.
Staff Training
We train our staff in how to keep your information safe and secure.
Secure handling and storage
When we send information overseas or use third parties that handle or store data, we put arrangements in place to protect your information.
System Security
When you log into our websites or apps, we encrypt data sent from your computer to our systems so no one else can access it.
We have firewalls, intrusion detection and virus scanning tools to stop viruses and unauthorised people accessing our systems.
When we send your electronic data to other organisations, we use secure networks or encryption.
We use passwords and/or smartcards to stop unauthorised people getting access.
Building Security
We use a mix of access restriction, cameras, guards and other controls in our buildings to prevent unauthorised access.
Destroying or de-identifying data when no longer required
We aim to keep personal information only for as long as we need it – for example for business or legal reasons. When we no longer need information, we take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify it.
8. Accessing, updating and correcting your information
You can contact us and ask to view your information. For more detailed information, you may need to fill out a request form. If your information isn’t correct or needs updating, let us know straight away.
Can you see what information we have?
You can ask us for a copy of your information, like your transaction files or a copy of any credit information we have about you, by going online or calling us.
For more detailed information, like what we’ve included in your file, you’ll need to fill out the Request for Access to Personal Information form included at the end of this policy. Send it to us using the contact details in Section 10.
Is there a fee?
There is no fee to ask for your information, but sometimes we may charge a maximum of $100.00 (AUD) as an access fee to cover the time we spend finding and collating the information you want. If there’s a fee, we’ll let you know how much it is likely to be, so you can choose if you want to go ahead. Generally, the fee is an hourly rate plus photocopying costs and other expenses. You’ll need to pay us before we start, or give us permission to take it out of your account.
How long will it take?
We try to make your information available within 30 days after you ask us for it. Before we give you the information, we’ll need to confirm your identity.
Can we refuse to give you access?
In some cases, we can refuse access or only give you access to certain information. For example, we might not let you see information that is commercially sensitive. If we do this, we’ll write to you explaining our decision.
Updating your information
It’s important that we have your correct details, such as your current home and email addresses and phone number. You can check or update your information at any branch, or by logging in to one of our websites or calling us (see Section 10).
Can you correct or update your information?
You can ask us to correct or update any information we have (including credit information). See Section 10 for ways to contact us. If we’ve given the information to another party, you can ask us to let them know it’s incorrect. We won’t charge a fee for this.
If the incorrect information was given to us by a credit reporting body, we may need to check with them or the relevant credit provider before we can change it. We’ll try to do this within 30 days. If we can’t, we’ll let you know why it’s taking longer and agree on a new timeframe with you. We’ll also tell you when we’ve corrected the information.
What if we believe the information is correct?
If we don’t think the information needs correcting, we’ll write to let you know why. You can ask us to include a statement with the information that says you believe it’s inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or out of date.

How can you make a complaint?

Appendix 1: Additional rights for individuals located in the European Union
The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has harmonised the data privacy laws of each individual EU country, giving more rights to individuals located in the EU and more obligations to organisations holding their personal information. In this Appendix, “personal information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the meaning given to the term “personal data” in the GDPR).
Personal information must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner. As such, if you are located in the EU, GDPR requires us to provide you with more information about how we collect, use, share and store your personal information as well as advising you of your rights as a ‘data subject’.
If you are located in the EU and have an enquiry relating to your rights under the GDPR, please contact: info@eChoice.com.au
What personal information do we collect?

Special Categories of Personal Information
The GDPR provides additional protection for personal information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, biometric data (for example your fingerprints), or data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation. We will only process this type of personal information with your consent or where otherwise lawfully permitted.
How long we keep your personal information
We will keep your personal information while you are a customer of Finconnect. We aim to keep your personal information for only as long as we need it.

You can ask that we not make decisions based on automated score alone or object to an automated decision and ask that a person review.
