Dispute Resolution
If a dispute arises between you and any of the Sentry Parties, it is the goal of Sentry to work in good faith with you to quickly and amicably resolve the dispute. All disputes, claims, or controversies (“Claims”) arising under or relating to these Terms, the Site, or the Services that cannot be resolved informally, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described herein.
Any dispute arising under or related to these Terms, the Site, or the Services (including the arbitrability of such a dispute and the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, termination or breach thereof) shall be finally settled by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), with the arbitration to be commenced no later than one (1) year after such Claim accrues. If you fail to commence binding arbitration within one year after such Claim accrues, it shall be deemed forever waived. A judgment upon an arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall be an expert in the field of Internet services. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that there shall be no class action arbitration related to these Terms, the Site, or the Services. All parties shall bear their own expenses, except that the parties shall equally share the expenses of the arbitrator (except for the required non-refundable filing fees which shall be paid solely by the party asserting the related Claim).
The above obligations to arbitrate shall not: (i) apply to violations of the Restrictions on Use of Sentry Materials contained above; or (ii) prevent a party from seeking a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, specific performance or other procedures in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute.
Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for arbitration or any other legal action or proceeding in any way related to the Site, the Services, or these Terms shall be in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Any matter brought before a court shall be brought solely in the state or federal courts located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The parties hereby waive their right to a jury trial.
Independent Parties
For purposes of these Terms, the parties hereto shall be independent contractors and neither shall at any time be considered an agent or employee of the other. No joint venture, partnership, or like relationship is created between the parties by the Terms.

However, should a valid business need arise, this online availability may be temporarily removed.
Insurance Score/Consumer Report
Insurance scoring is a system used to determine credit worthiness and the stability of prospective financial and insurance applicants. Information about you and your credit experiences, such as your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts with late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt and the age of your accounts is collected from your credit report. Using a statistical program, specialized companies compare this information to the credit performance of consumers with similar profiles. An insurance scoring system awards points for each factor and a final score is computed.
In connection with this application for insurance, we may review your credit history or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score based on the information contained in that credit history. We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance score. We will not order your credit history or order a credit-based insurance score if it is prohibited by your state's laws. Your agreement to the Terms of the Site indicates your consent that we may order this report.
We cannot use credit history or an insurance score for any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason. Additionally, credit history or an insurance score based wholly or partly on residence, sex, race, color, creed, occupation, income, physical handicap or disability of an applicant or insured is prohibited. The information acquired to do the insurance scoring will be kept confidential and will only be used by our company to determine your rate.
Motor Vehicle Report
A routine inquiry may be made to obtain the motor vehicle records of all drivers of the vehicle(s) being insured. We may also obtain information from previous insurance companies. Reports received may contain information concerning character, general reputation, personal characteristics and mode of living. Upon written request, additional information as to the nature and scope of the report, if one is made, will be provided. Your agreement to the Terms of the Site indicates your consent that we may order this report.
Sentry will verify the information you have given. Your agreement to the Terms of the Site indicates your authorization of Sentry Insurance Group to obtain investigative consumer reports including motor vehicle records, loss reports and credit reports, as necessary to evaluate your application.
FAILURE TO DISCLOSE ALL ACCIDENTS AND CONVICTIONS MAY JEOPARDIZE COVERAGE OR CHANGE QUOTED POLICY PREMIUMS.
EFT/Credit Card Use
To complete your transaction online, you must authorize Sentry to draw funds from a credit card account. The initial down payment will be drawn from a credit card that you are legally authorized to use. You agree to be bound by all Terms set forth by the credit card issuer for repayment of those funds. Should you choose to pay your monthly installments by electronic fund transfer, you represent that you are the authorized owner of that bank account and authorize Sentry to initiate debit entries for the amount specified, at the depository financial institution indicated, and to debit specified amounts from such savings or checking bank account. You agree that your authorization will remain in full force and effective until Sentry has received notice from you of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford Sentry a reasonable opportunity to act on it.
