Shipping policy
Where do you ship to?
We ship to any location in the USA from our warehouse in Reno, Nevada, USA.
How much is shipping?
$10. That's right $10 for items under $99. Over $99, it’s free.
When will I get my stuff?
Soon! You will receive a shipping confirmation email once we process your order. In it, there is a tracking number and a link to the corresponding shipping company’s website.
Do you ship express?
Currently, we are only able to offer Standard shipping rates and times.
What methods of shipping do you offer?
We ship UPS Standard ground shipping to all destinations in the USA unless it is a big package which will ship with OnTrac.
My package was damaged during shipping
Contact us immediately, and we’ll be in touch with the form for you to fill out. Once we gather the information, we can either replace the part, fix it, etc. Initial contact must be made within 48 hours of delivery.
Can you ship it to my local bike shop?
If you’d like your parts delivered to a bike shop, we recommend you simply order the part through them. Prices should be the same either way, and if you order through your local shop, you get the service and warranty through them. We know them, they’re nice people.
