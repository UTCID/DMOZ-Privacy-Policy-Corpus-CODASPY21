Posted: October 9, 2020 | Tradewinds, Legal Advice
The ConsensusDocs Coalition has announced the industry’s first standard contract document to address one of the most important and growing trends in the design and construction industry – prefabricated construction.

MBI recently joined the ConsensusDocs Council as result of the successful work conducted by the working group.
