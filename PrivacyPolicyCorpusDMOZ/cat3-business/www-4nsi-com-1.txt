Software
Our efX Software Suite including DR & CT X-ray viewing and analysis, DICONDE management, and more.
High performance image processing and measurement functions using GPU for faster acquisitions.
3D X-ray (CT) has never been easier with Automatic Parallelization for systems with multiple CPU’s and GPU’s, an Intuitive interface, and OpenGL based 3D volume rendering.
Our efX software is fully DICONDE compliant
Innovations
Each new innovation is designed to improve capabilities, increase speed, or create a solution the industry has never seen before.
Our CXMMs (Coordinate X-ray Measuring Machine) make use of non-contact and non-destructive technology that provides unique advantages compared to classical Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs).
Automated X-ray CT scanning systems make batch scanning and part loading and unloading effortless.
Improve resolution of images with a combination of hardware and a proprietary software algorithm.
Stitch multiple images together forming one seamless image with a much larger field of view.
Spiral acquisition and reconstruction with a digital flat-panel detector.
Reconstruct a complete 3D CT model that includes time and motion, creating a truly dynamic volumetric dataset.
Ring Reduction compensates for the irregular response of the detector pixels during a CT scan.
Markets
The uses of Digital Radiography and Computed Tomography are very diverse. There are few limits on what we can scan and what we can see; we’re working every day to push those limits.

North Star Imaging’s Inspection Services Group provides real-time X-ray inspection and CT scanning services to verify the integrity of internal components, with quick turn around times.
2D X-ray Scanning
Realtime product analysis, failure analysis, live manipulation, product screening and much more
3D X-ray Scanning
Using X-ray to build a 3D model of your part we can then inspect it from any angle to isolate materials of different density and much more.
High Energy X-ray Scanning
Six million electron volts paired with proprietary scatter reduction technology; NSI’s MeVX6 has the power to get through your most difficult parts.
Maintenance & Technical Services
No matter where you are, we are at your service 24 hours a day. If it is not between 8 AM and 5 PM CST, leave a message and our on-call service technician will get back to you within 24 hours.
