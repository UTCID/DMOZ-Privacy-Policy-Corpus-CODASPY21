Shipping Policy
Shipping charges are not refundable unless the item was shipped to you in error. Contact our Customer Support department for instructions to return a package shipped to you in error.
Delivery Options
Orders placed online are processed within 1-2 business days and generally arrive in 7-10 business days via standard ground delivery. Shipping charges are based on the total amount of each order. For even faster delivery, we offer FedEx next day or second day express delivery for an additional charge. Express delivery does not expedite order processing. Express packages will ship anywhere in the continental United States.
International Orders – Canada
International orders ship standard economy and generally arrive in 7-10 business days. For an additional fee, we also offer an expedited shipping option. Express delivery does not expedite order processing. To help your package move through customs hassle-free, shipping charges cover duty, tax, and customs broker fees. Your package should be cleared by customs and on its way with no delays.
