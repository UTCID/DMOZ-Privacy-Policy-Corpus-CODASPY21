Because the Company gathers information about users at many points in this Site, we believe you should understand how the Company intends to treat any personally identifiable information users may provide. Personally identifiable information is information that can identify the user, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, street address, telephone number, employer and occupational title.
ACCEPTANCE
Any use of this Site by you conclusively indicates that this Privacy Policy has been reviewed and accepted by you. If you do not agree with any of the provisions of this Privacy Policy, you should not use this Site or provide any information to us through the Site.

At various points in this Site, you may be requested to submit personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, street address, phone number, employer and occupational title. The Company does not collect personal information about you unless you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
Forms
Forms may be used on this Site to collect information from you, which will allow us to carry out a number of tasks, including, but not limited to, fulfilling literature requests, responding to product inquiries or technical questions, and processing employment inquiries. Any personal information collected is intended to be used only for delivery or follow-up purposes. In order to effectively respond to and support certain user requests, the Company may share your information with its business channel partners such as distributors and sales representatives for the Company's products. You may opt-out from being contacted or receiving follow-up mailings at any time (See Choice/Opt-Out below).

Occasionally, the Company may invite you to participate in online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information (for example, your email address), industry information, and demographic information (like your zip code or the state in which your business is located). Contact information is used to contact you if and when necessary with respect to the survey unless otherwise specifically indicated by you. You may opt-out from being contacted or receiving follow-up mailings at any time (See Choice/Opt-Out below). It is not necessary to participate in surveys to use this Site.
Public Forums

Information disclosed in these areas may be available to other visitors to this Site, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.

Such personal information includes personal identification, business relationship and information relating to your entitlement to access the restricted portion of the website as well as your activities within areas of the restricted portions.

Like most standard website servers, this Site's web servers generate log files that store certain types of information about you and your visit to this Site. Categories of information collected include length of time of visit, pages visited, number of visits, frequency of visits, internet service provider and IP address used to connect to the Site, referring/exit pages, and platform type (IP addresses, etc., are not tied to personally identifiable information). Information collected in the log files is used solely for internal use by the Company to analyze trends, administer this Site, track user movements in the aggregate, gather broad demographic information for aggregate reporting and statistical purposes, and for improvement of the Site.
This Site may also use client-side JavaScript and first-party cookies to help the Company collect and analyze site-visitation statistics as described above.

INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
The Company may disclose the information it collects from and about you: (a) when it has reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of the Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities, or is appropriate or necessary to enforce the terms of use, take precautions against liability, investigate and defend against any third-party claims or allegations, and/or protect the security or integrity of the Site; (b) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or that such action is necessary or appropriate in connection with a court or administrative proceeding or to comply with a court or administrative subpoena, order or legal process; (c) to our business partners, such as distributors and sales representatives who sell and service products in which you may be interested, and/or to its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing any request on your behalf, provided that if the information shared includes any personal information, such business partners will be bound by obligations of confidentiality with respect to your personal information that are at least as restrictive as those imposed upon the Company by this privacy policy; or (d) otherwise with your consent. The Company may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such event, it may transfer or assign the information it has collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In such transactions, your personal information may be included in the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, it may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used and your personal information may be included in the transferred assets. The Company also reserves the right to use your personal and non-personal information for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, improving content and generating statistical and aggregate reports for internal use by the Company and its vendors, suppliers, licensees, consultants, advertisers and advisers.
