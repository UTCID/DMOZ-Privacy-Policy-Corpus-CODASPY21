** Please allow 1 Business day for tracking information to become live once received
FREE SHIPPING on most orders over $99.99!*
Get FREE Shipping Now!
Get FREE Shipping to most destinations across Canada when you order over $99.99* from Williams Food Equipment! If your order is over $99.99* we'll ship your order to you absolutely FREE! It's our way of saying thanks for shopping at Williams Food Equipment!
Free Shipping Across Canada:
At Williams Food Equipment not only will you find the lowest prices on a huge selection of cookware, bakeware and kitchenware, you'll also get FREE shipping to most destinations in Canada for orders over $99.99* Some restrictions apply.
Unfortunately individual items weighing over 30 pounds are excluded from our free freight policy. Even so, we can offer excellent freight rates to destinations across Canada.
Delivery Time:
We process all orders during regular business hours (M-F 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time). We will make our best efforts to ship your order in a timely manner however delays do occassionally occur beyond the control of Williams Food Equipment. Please note that items that are listed as "available" may need to be ordered from the manufacturer which may cause additional delays; whereas items listed as "in stock" should usually be ready to be shipped the following business day.
Multiple Package Shipments:
Although we make every attempt to ship all orders complete, sometimes it may be necessary to break up orders in two or more packages or into multiple shipments.  We will partial ship an order when the subtotal of the partial does exceed 99$, otherwise the order will be held until all items are available to ship.  If you would like your order partial shipped and it does not qualify, please contact us and we can discuss the cost associated with a partial shipment.
P.O. Box Shipments:
Unfortunately only Canada Post can ship to P.O. Boxes, thus this option is limited to the size and weight of the parcel. For your protection, a signature is required upon delivery of your order.
Freight Bound Shipments:
Items that are too large to qualify for our standard shipping rates will be shipped via freight carrier. Williams Food Equipment has established discounted rates with various Canadian freight carriers and will arrange your shipment door-to-door if you wish. In any event, you will always be notified of freight charges before your order is processed so that you can approve them.
Delivery Address Accuracy:
In order to ship your package, we require a complete street address with postal code to insure that you get prompt delivery. We are not responsible for shipments that are delayed, lost, or misdirected due to an inaccurate address being provided. Williams Food Equipment will not be responsible if additional shipping charges are accrued because of incorrect or incomplete addresses. If a problem with a shipping address is discovered, we will attempt to contact you and correct the problem however it is ultimately your responsibility to provide us with accurate information.
Damaged, Lost or Short Shipments
Damaged, lost or short shipments should be reported to us immediately so that we can re-ship the merchandise and/or register a damage claim with the appropriate carrier. Please do not accept packages that are obviously opened or damaged. Keep damaged goods and containers exactly as they were delivered until you're advised otherwise.
Make sure to inspect all freight-bound shipments prior to accepting the contents for any damage. Report damage directly to the delivery person and clearly mark the bill of lading as "DAMAGED". All damaged shipments must be reported to us within 24 hours of delivery. Report all damaged shipments to: chefstore@williamsfoodequipment.com
Free Shipping Policy Restrictions:
* Free shipping does not apply to large and/or heavy items (over 30lbs) or any items requiring a freight carrier. Items that have a "HEAVY ITEM" shipping designation will be shipped and billed to you at the most economical rates we have available. Please note: your order total must be a minimum of $99.99 (before applicable taxes) to qualify for free shipping.  Your parcel may either be shipped with Canada Post, UPS or Canpar depending on your location.
Our Free Shipping offer applies to most locations in Canada excluding but not limited to: The Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Quebec, any island location as well as any other destination requiring ocean or air freight service in any province or territory. This policy also excludes all locations in Canada deemed as "remote" by Canada Post, Purolator Courier, or UPS.
In the extremely unlikely event that excessive freight rates are charged or quoted by our couriers for any other reason not stated in this policy, Williams Food Equipment reserves the right to exempt that shipment from this policy. In all instances you will be contacted before your order ships to notify you of any extra freight charges not charged at the time of order. At that time you can either approve or cancel your order if you wish.
More than 95% of Canadians do not reside in an area that would be classified as "remote". If however you're unsure as to whether or not you're in a designated remote location, just email us anytime at chefstore@williamsfoodequipment.com or call us at 1-888-334-3233 during regular business hours (Mon-Fri 9-6 and Sat 9-4)
