3 PLACING AN ORDER AND CANCELLATION
3.1 The goods displayed on the Site, in Our catalogues, advertisements and other materials and information about the goods, the services and the prices on the Site or elsewhere are an invitation for You to offer to buy and are not an offer by Us to sell which is capable of acceptance by you.
3.2 You may place an Order with Us by contacting Us by telephone, completing an order form and posting or faxing it back to Us or when you click the "Complete Order" button after completing Our on-line order form. Each Order will constitute an offer by You to purchase the Goods and/or Services subject to these Conditions.
3.3 Each of Your Orders shall be deemed accepted by Us if We issue an Acknowledgement to You, deliver Goods to You or commence performance of any Services (whichever of the foregoing happens first). Acceptance in accordance with this Clause will create a binding Contract, subject to these Conditions. Please note that We will only issue an Acknowledgement where You have requested that We do so or where We agree to supply Goods that are tailored to Your specifications.
3.4 Acceptance of Your Order is not a guarantee by Us of the availability of the Goods and all acceptances and/or acknowledgements are conditional on availability of the Goods and the availability of resources to perform the Services.
3.5 If You are an individual purchasing as a consumer (as defined by the Distance Selling Regulations 2000) You must be over eighteen (18) years of age and have completed Our registration process before You can purchase Goods and/or Services from us.
3.6 Without prejudice to Our general right to refuse to accept any Order, We specifically reserve the right to refuse to accept any of Your Orders if We believe for any reason that in supplying any Goods to You We would be committing an offence under any law. We reserve the right to use any legal method to verify Your age (or the age of any person placing the Order on Your behalf if You are not a natural person) and to request additional information from You for that purpose. If We are unable to verify Your age where We are required to by law We will cancel Your Order. We reserve the right to require that any Goods are signed for by an adult aged eighteen (18) years of age or over on delivery. You consent (or if You are not a natural person, the person placing the Order on Your behalf consents) to Us obtaining, storing, using and sharing with third parties personal information provided or obtained for the purpose of age verification.
3.7 If the Goods which You have ordered are not available or We are unable to perform the Services you have requested, We shall inform You of this as soon as possible but in any event within thirty (30) days from when You placed Your Order.
3.8 If You receive confirmation of an Order which You did not place, or if the details in the Acknowledgement do not match the Order which You placed or intended to place, You must contact Our customer services department to cancel the Order or correct the details prior to delivery of the Order.
3.9 These Conditions are the only conditions upon which We are prepared to deal with You and shall apply to the exclusion of all others (except those which by law, We cannot exclude). Any standard form documents You issue to Us which purport to apply any standard terms and conditions of Yours are accepted by Us for convenience only and shall not affect the application of this Clause (regardless of when or how those documents are sent to us).

6.9 Without prejudice to Clause 6.8, if You fail or We reasonably believe that You will fail to pay for the Goods and/or the Services when due We may demand payment of all sums due and suspend any future performance of the Contract until all overdue sums have been paid.
6.10 In the event that You make any overpayment to Us, We will advise You of this within a reasonable period of time and repay any such overpayment to You at Your request. In the event that You fail to request repayment within 3 (three) years of the date upon which the overpayment was made, We shall be entitled to retain such overpayment.

28 MODERN SLAVERY ACT
28.1 The Modern Slavery Act, the first of its kind in Europe, received Royal Assent on 26 March 2015. The act consolidates slavery and trafficking offenses and introduces tougher penalties and sentencing rules. It ensures that the main offences are subject to the toughest asset recovery regime under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, introduces bespoke slavery and trafficking compensation orders, and provides for the confiscation of vehicles, ships and aircraft used for the purposes of trafficking. The changes will ensure that the National Crime Agency, the police and other law enforcement agencies have the powers they need to pursue, disrupt and bring to justice those engaged in human trafficking and slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. It also introduces measures to enhance the protection of victims of slavery and trafficking. A new Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner has been appointed whose role is to encourage good practice in the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of slavery and human trafficking offences, as well as the identification of victims of those offences. This role is relevant to all current slavery and trafficking offences in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We are pleased to confirm that HC Slingsby PLC and subsidiary companies have read and understood the Act, and furthermore undertake to meet its requirements.
