Privacy Policy
Introduction
We take our customers data very seriously and will never share your information/sell your data onto any third parties under no circumstances. We are only a small company and do not hold any databases of information on our customers, only using emails to respond to enquiries and carry out services. Incase you need any further information about the limited data we hold on you on our website, please feel free to read on below.
Website Cookies
Cookies are also used for our website security protection plugin (called iThemes). This plugin reads IP addresses so that it can better secure the site – and offers an IP blacklist/whitelist to protect our site from being hacked.
You do have the option to disable cookies in your browser if you so choose, by finding your settings and following these instructions. This should not affect the functionality of the company website, but could affect other sites you may visit.
Emails from the Enquiry Form
Our Contact Enquiry Form is a simple way for you to send us details of the service you require from us. The information provided is only used for our company to build quotes for services offered. Only our colleagues process this information to build estimates/quotes in-house and information does not leave our office. We do not store these emails on a database and do not use them for mailing lists.
We never send unsolicited emails to our clients, and will only contact you in regards to any services you request from us. Emails are only backed up onto local disk drives and are not accessible to anyone who is not a company employee.
We do not share these client emails or email addresses with any external parties, unless we receive express permission from the client to do so (such as when forwarding on a message at their request).
Invoices
We hold names, company addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses from our clients for invoices. This is only used for accounting and tax purposes. Under the GDPR we are not required to ask for consent to send invoices and other transactional emails to customers. We only use this personal information internally and do not share any information with other businesses or for marketing reasons.
The ‘Right to Be Forgotten’
Under the new GDPR, individuals can now request ‘the right to be forgotton’. If for any reason you’d like to have your personal data removed from our systems or to request a report of what data we hold on you, it is your legal right to request this and for us to comply within 1 month. We will provide a report to show you this has been done. For more information from the ICO regarding ‘the right to erasure’, please see here.
If you’d like your web data to be erased, please contact us via the Contact Us form.
