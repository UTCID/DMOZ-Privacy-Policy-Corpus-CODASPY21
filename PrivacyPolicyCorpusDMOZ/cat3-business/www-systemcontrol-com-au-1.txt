2. Visitor Information
During the course of any visit to the System Control Engineering website, the pages you see, along with a short text file called a 'cookie', are downloaded to your computer. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better online user experience, such as storing your preferences. System Control Engineering does not share cookie information with any other organisation.
System Control Engineering uses a service called "Google Analytics" to allow System Control Engineering to better track usage of the web site by customers and to analyse from that track usage which campaigns and which websites and functions are popular and which are not. The Google Analytics service adopted by System Control Engineering tracks visitors using cookies and does not divulge any personal information about the user/ visitor to the website. It simply uses the IP address to generate reports containing general numbers of visits, popular web pages etc.
Please note that if you do not wish Google Analytics to operate and generate reports in respect of your usage of the System Control Engineering website you can block the use of cookies on your PC. In that instance data cannot be collected on your website usage by Google Analytics. This is your right. Please note that there may be some loss of functionality if you do disable cookies. Please see below for further information concerning cookies or visit http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/ to learn about Google Policies and Principles.
3. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. To protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
Many websites do this whenever a user visits in order to track online traffic flows.
Cookies record information about your online preferences, and store such information relevant to your current visit such as a unique session identifier. As stated above this is the purpose of
Google Analytics - to track usage and trends of the System Control Engineering web site. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the System Control Engineering website features. Each browser is different; so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

4. Use and storage of your personal information
When you supply any personal information to the System Control Engineering website for online ordering, user account setup, etc. we have legal obligations towards you in the way we use the data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use it and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else (see the notices on particular webpages that let you know why we are requesting the information). In general information that you provide to System Control Engineering will only be used within System Control Engineering (and by its agents and service providers).
Your information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to the System Control Engineering website or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour, System Control Engineering can use whatever information is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or so long as statutory records must be kept e.g. purchase data/payments etc. Where personal information is held for entities that are not yet clients but have registered information with System Control Engineering, that information will be held as long as is necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with relevant Data Protection laws. As explained above the implementation of Google Analytics by System Control Engineering does not involve the retention of personal information.
