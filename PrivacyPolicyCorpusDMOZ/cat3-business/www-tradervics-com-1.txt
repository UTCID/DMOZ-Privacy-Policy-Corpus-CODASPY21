Submissions
We welcome your feedback and comments regarding our products and services. However, we cannot accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials, and we ask that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials of any kind to us. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by Indeed Labs’s or its affiliates’ professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we ask that you not send us any original creative materials of any kind, including show designs, photographs, drawings or original artwork. If you send us (including through App Store reviews) creative ideas, suggestions or materials of any kind despite our request not to do so (an “unsolicited submission”), you acknowledge and agree that we may treat the unsolicited submission to be non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance and in all respects.
From time to time, we may solicit creative ideas, suggestions or materials from users of our Site or blog. If you at anytime send, provide us with or post creative ideas, suggestions or any other materials in response to our request (each, a “requested submission” and together with unsolicited submissions, “submissions”), you acknowledge and agree that we may treat the requested submission as non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance and in all respects.
You agree that we have no obligation of confidence to you with respect to any submission and we shall not be liable to you in any way for any use or disclosure of any submission. We may use any submission without restriction for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast or posting, and you hereby irrevocably waive, release and give up any claim that any use of such submission violates any of your rights including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights, publicity rights or right to credit for the material or ideas.
You hereby irrevocably grant to us the right, but not the obligation, to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, license, perform, post, sell, translate, incorporate, create derivative works from, distribute and otherwise use the submission in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the universe, in perpetuity, without according you any compensation or credit. By submitting a submission to us, you represent that such submission is original to you and does not conflict with, violate or infringe upon the rights of any third parties including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights and rights of publicity and/or privacy. All submissions made by you shall be the sole property of Indeed Labs and will not be acknowledged or returned. You agree and understand that we are not obligated to use any submission you make and you have no right to compel such use.

You understand and acknowledge that we have broad access to ideas, products designs and other materials related to our business, and that new ideas, products, designs and other materials are constantly submitted to us or being developed by our own employees. Many submissions that we receive or ideas, products, designs and materials that are independently developed by us may be competitive with, similar or identical to your submission. You acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of our use of any such similar or identical submission or independently developed ideas, products, designs or materials.
You acknowledge that, with respect to any claim you may have relating to or arising out of our actual or alleged exploitation or use of any submission you make, the damage, if any, caused thereby will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle you to injunctive or other equitable relief or to in any way enjoin the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of any production based on or allegedly based on your submission, and your rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law.
