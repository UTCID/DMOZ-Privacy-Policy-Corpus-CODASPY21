Update: Walk-in centers will permanently close on January 15, 2021.
Walk-In Centers
We temporarily closed our walk-in centers to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. But we’re permanently closing them on January 15, 2021.
Six walk-in center locations will continue to have payment drop-boxes available Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., until January 14, 2021:
Grand Rapids — Cascade Center
Grand Rapids — Steketee's Building
Detroit — Whitmer Building
Lansing — South Capitol Avenue Building
Marquette — Marquette Center
Southfield — BCN Commons
You can use one of those locations to pay your bill through January 14, 2021. We accept checks, cashier checks and money orders. You should include your payment coupon, too.
