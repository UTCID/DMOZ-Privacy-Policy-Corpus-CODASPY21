GALA and IAA release guide to privacy laws
Gala And IAA Release First-Ever Guide To Privacy Laws Related To Advertising And MarketingThe Global Advertising Lawyers Alliance ("GALA") and the International Advertising Association (“IAA”) announced today that they have just released the two-volume set, Privacy Law: A Global Legal Perspective on Data Protection Relating to Advertising & Marketing.  It is the first-ever guide to how privacy laws affect marketing and advertising around the world. The more than 700 page guide provides a comprehensive look at how privacy and data protection laws affect advertising and marketing in more than 70 countries – from Argentina to Zimbabwe.  The guide also provides detailed information about how to comply with privacy laws in the European Union.    “Privacy compliance has shifted from a business best practice to a business necessity,” wrote Daniel Goldberg, from Frankfurt Kurnit, one of GALA’s U.S. members, in the Forward. In an Introduction to the book, Srinivasan Swamy, Chairman & World President of the International Advertising Association, wrote, “We hope that this Global Privacy Laws handbook will be an excellent reference volume to all major marketing companies and governments around the world.” Organized by country, each chapter provides detailed information about how privacy is regulated in that country with respect to advertising and marketing, and covers such topics as, rules about collection and storage of personal data, data breaches, and regulatory enforcement.  Each chapter also provides unique insights about how the privacy landscape has changed in recent years, where the changes will be in the future, and the challenges companies face. A virtual launch event for the book is planned for July 8, 2020. The program – which will feature thought leaders from around the world -- will include a panel discussion on “Evolving Privacy Regulations and the Challenges of Dealing with a Fragmented Regime."  More information about the event will be available shortly on the GALA and IAA websites.  “It’s absolutely critical that the laws governing privacy and data security be top-of-mind for marketers around the world,” said Jeffrey A. Greenbaum, Managing Partner of Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz in New York and GALA's Chairman.  “We’re thrilled to partner with the IAA to publish this indispensable guide.” Hard copies of the book are available for purchase on Amazon.com.  Pdf versions are also available, for free, by contacting GALA or the IAA.     ABOUT GALAWith firms representing more than 95 countries, each GALA member has the local expertise and experience in advertising, marketing and promotion law that will help your campaign achieve its objectives, and navigate the legal minefield successfully.
