Privacy Notice
Introduction
We at A-Z Restaurant Equipment Company are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.
A-Z has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit A-Z's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
A-Z strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, A-Z intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site.

Choice
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to A-Z. The notice we intend to provide where A-Z collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of A-Z's Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
If you chose to have a relationship with A-Z, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, A-Z wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting A-Z should you need to update or correct that Information.

A-Z does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on A-Z's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against A-Z's policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
