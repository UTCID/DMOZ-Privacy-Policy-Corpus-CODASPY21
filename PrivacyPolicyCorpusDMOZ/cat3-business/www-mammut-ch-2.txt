Why does Mammut use cookies?
We use the information collected by cookies as follows:
Improving the website's user-friendliness;
Recognising your computer when you visit our website;
Customising our website's design specifically for you;
Managing the website;
Preventing fraud and improving the website's security;

Legal Basis
The legal basis for processing personal data in connection with cookies is founded on legitimate interests or consent.
Web Analysis
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google“) and Econda Shop Monitor from Econda GmbH (“Econda“).
Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and make it possible to analyse your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website is normally transferred to one of Google's servers in the USA and stored there. On this website IP anonymisation has been activated, so that the user's IP address is abbreviated beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to one of Google's servers in the USA and abbreviated there. Google will utilise this information on behalf of the operator of this website to analyse the use of this website, compile reports on website activity and to provide its operator with additional services related to the use of the website and of the Internet. The IP address transmitted from your browser in connection with Google Analytics is not combined with other data held by Google. You can find additional information about data protection at Google here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners. You can prevent the storage of cookies by configuring your browser software appropriately; however, please note that, if you do this, you may not be able to use all of this website's features to the fullest extent.
You can also prevent the data generated by the cookie regarding your use of the website (including your IP address) from being recorded and transferred to Google and from being processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin via the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
Data are collected and stored using solutions and technologies of Econda GmbH to meet users' needs and to optimise this website, as well as for marketing purposes; these data are also employed to create usage profiles by utilising pseudonyms. Cookies that enable the recognition of an Internet browser can be used for this purpose. Data pertaining to the bearer of the pseudonym are only utilised to compile usage profiles with the express consent of the visitor. In particular, IP addresses are disguised immediately upon entry, thus making it impossible to match usage profiles to IP addresses. Visitors to this website can prospectively opt out of this data collection and storage anytime here. As the opt-out applies only to the device and web browser on which it was set, please repeat this process on all other devices if applicable. If you delete the opt-out cookie, requests are again sent to Econda.
Use of Social Plugins
On the website, we use so-called "social plugins", e.g., from Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc., which bear the logo of the respective provider. These plugins are intended to better distribute the content of our website. The legal basis for the processing is founded on our legitimate interest in distributing the content of our website.
Our website contains buttons that you can use to share content on the sites via Facebook, Twitter and Google services. Facebook, Twitter und Google are social networks that are not connected with Mammut. These companies have their respective registered offices at the following addresses:
Facebook: 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA
Twitter: 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA
Google: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA
If you use Facebook, Twitter or Google's "share" button, your device will access the respective websites. As a result, your data will be sent to the party associated with the "share" button. Your computer uses your browser to set up a direct connection to the provider's computer. The plugin's content is transferred by the provider directly to your computer and integrated into the web page by your browser. The provider thereby receives notification that you have called up the relevant Mammut website. If you are simultaneously logged on to the respective provider, this provider may also add your visit to your profile. You will find more information about the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data by Facebook, Twitter and Google in their respective privacy statements, which can be accessed from their respective websites.

Pixel tags are tiny graphic images and small blocks of code placed on website pages and ads that allow us to determine whether you performed a specific action. When you access these pages, the pixel tags let us know you have accessed the web page. These tools help us measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
