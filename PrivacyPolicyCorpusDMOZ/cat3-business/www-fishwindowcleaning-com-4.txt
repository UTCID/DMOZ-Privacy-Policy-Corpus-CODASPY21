Verification Process
Upon receipt of the request to know, request to opt-out, and/or request to delete, we will attempt to verify your identity.

If you submit a request to delete, three data points are used to identify you before the process is initiated.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the rights provided by the CCPA set forth in this California Privacy Policy. Please note that a legitimate denial of a request for information, deletion, or to opt-out is not discriminatory, nor is charging a fee for excessive or repetitive consumer requests, as permitted by the CCPA.

You have the right to request that we delete certain Personal Information that we have collected. Please note that there are circumstances in which we may not be able to comply with your request pursuant to the CCPA, including when we cannot verify your request and/or when there is a conflict with our own obligations to comply with other legal or regulatory requirements.

Authorized Agents
You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights under the CCPA on your behalf.
Pursuant to the CCPA:
Only a business entity or natural person registered with the California Secretary of State may act as an authorized agent.
You must provide the authorized agent written permission to exercise your rights under the CCPA on your behalf.
We may deny a request from an authorized agent on your behalf if the authorized agent does not submit proof that he, she, or it has been authorized by you to act on your behalf if we request such proof, as permitted by the CCPA.
Even if you use an authorized agent to exercise your rights under the CCPA on your behalf, pursuant to the CCPA we may still require that you verify your own identity directly to us. This provision does not apply if you have provided with a power of attorney under California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.

We are proud of this Site and we strive to ensure that it doesnt offend people of any age.

Right to Opt-Out
You have the right to request that we do not sell Personal Information that we have collected. If you exercise that right, please note that pursuant to the CCPA we may have to subsequently inform you that you need to opt-in if the sale of your Personal Information is required to complete a transaction you have initiated. If opting-in is required, we will provide you with the necessary instructions.
If you would like to request that we do not sell your Personal Information pursuant to the requirements of the CCPA, click here or call (877) 707-3474. The link will take you to an interactive webform that you can complete and submit to make a request for deletion; if you use the telephone number, you will be guided through a process that will allow you to submit a request.

The CCPA requires that you provide the authorized agent written permission to exercise your rights under the CCPA.
