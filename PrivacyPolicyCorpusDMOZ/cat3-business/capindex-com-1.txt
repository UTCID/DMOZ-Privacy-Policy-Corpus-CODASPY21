PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS
The data provided to our clients with respect to a geographic area under review are based on the United States, Canadian, and United Kingdom census data, other public records or census data from additional countries, and data licensed from third parties. Although these data are considered highly reliable, we are not able to vouch for their completeness or accuracy, and in some instances licensed data showing facility locations may become outdated. Nevertheless, our statistical analysis as expressed in our Products and Services, loss experience validations or other services must assume that these data, as recorded and compiled by the various governmental agencies or private licensors, are in fact complete, accurate, and current. Furthermore, if any Products or Services, or materials include our conclusions with respect to crime risk by site, those conclusions are based upon statistical analysis, and therefore constitute probabilities of criminal activity over a period of time, not certainties.
CRIMECAST® Reports have been generated for multiple sites using latitude/longitude identifications. To the extent you have provided CAP Index, Inc. with those latitude/longitude identifications, CAP Index, Inc. has not independently verified the accuracy of the site identifications. CAP Index, Inc. will provide reports and maps based on the actual latitude/longitude identified by you, and thus the accuracy of those reports and maps will depend on the accuracy of the data provided by you.
CAP Index, Inc. may have provided you with latitude/longitude site identifications as a part of its address geocoding service, either in conjunction with a CRIMECAST® Report, or as a separate service. Address geocoding provided by CAP Index, Inc. is based on physical addresses provided by you. Once again, CAP Index, Inc. does not independently verify the accuracy of those addresses, and thus the accuracy of the resulting CAP Index, Inc. products or services will depend on the accuracy of the data provided by you.
PAYMENT AND EXPIRATION OF CREDITS
Payment for the product or services provided under the foregoing terms and conditions shall be due upon receipt of an invoice from CAP Index, Inc. unless otherwise expressly provided by separate written agreement between the client and CAP Index, Inc.
ALL CREDITS ISSUED TO YOU FOR FUTURE USE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SHALL EXPIRE UPON THE “EFFECTIVE DATE”, WHICH SHALL BE THE EARLIEST OF THE FOLLOWING EVENTS: (a) ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF YOUR PAYMENT FOR SUCH CREDITS; (b) THE DATE OF YOUR FIRST RECEIPT OF ANY CAP INDEX PRODUCT, OR (c) THE DATE OF YOUR ORIGINAL ORDER FORM, UNLESS NOTED DIFFERENTLY ON YOUR ORDER FORM.
FOR MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS, UNLESS NOTED DIFFERENTLY ON YOUR ORDER FORM:  (a) ALL CRIMECAST REPORTS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF YOUR PURCHASE AND ONE CREDIT WILL BE DEDUCTED PER REPORT; (b) SO LONG AS YOUR AGREEMENT IS IN FORCE, UNUSED REPORT CREDITS WILL ROLLOVER FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AND REMAIN AVAILABLE IN YOUR ACCOUNT; AND, (c) ANY UNUSED REPORT CREDITS WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE TERM.
