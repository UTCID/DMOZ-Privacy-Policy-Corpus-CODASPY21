Forward Looking Statements
The Site
may contain “forward-looking statements” as defined in the U.S. Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Users are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and any such
forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the following cautionary statements. Such statements involve uncertainties
and risks and there can be no assurance that actual results will not
differ from the company's expectations. The words "should'',
"believes'', "anticipates'', "plans'', "may'',
"expects'', "projects'', "estimates'' and other expressions
that indicate future events and trends identify forward looking
statements. Factors which could cause materially different results
include, among others, customer acceptance of new product categories and
service offerings, timing of the completion and integration of
acquisitions, the frequency and magnitude of paper price changes, the pace
of new customer sales ramp-ups, changes in software and communications
technologies, general economic and business conditions, competitive
actions, and other cautionary statements contained in RR Donnelley's
filings with the SEC.  All
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are
made and are based on current expectations and involve a number of
assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results
to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.  RR Donnelley disclaims any obligation to
update or revise any forward-looking statements on this Site.
