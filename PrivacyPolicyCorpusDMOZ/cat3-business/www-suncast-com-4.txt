IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.
General
This Website provides information about Suncast and its merchandise and services and facilitates the purchase of such merchandise and services. All merchandise advertised on this Website is available for delivery only within the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.  Use of this Website is limited to legitimate purposes.  Suncast may, from time to time, introduce new features to this Website, or modify or delete existing features, in its sole discretion.  Suncast shall notify User of any of these changes to features to the extent Suncast is required by law to do so.  By using any new or modified features when they become available, User agrees to be bound by these Terms concerning such features.
Any access or attempted access of other areas of Suncast’s computer systems or other information contained therein for any purpose is strictly prohibited. User agrees not to interfere in any way with others’ use of or access to this Website or to take any action that imposes an unreasonable or unusually large load on this Website.  Suncast reserves the right to report any activity that it reasonably suspects violates any law or regulation and to disclose any information to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties.
Suncast has the right in its sole discretion, and without prior notice and from time to time, to modify these Terms with respect to User’s access to or use of this Website. Such modifications and additions shall be effective immediately upon posting the modified Terms to this Website, which posting shall be deemed notice to User.  If User disagrees with the changes to these Terms, User should discontinue User’s use of this Website.  Any access to or use of this Website after posting of modifications or additions to these Terms shall constitute and be deemed to be such User’s agreement to such modified Terms.  SUNCAST RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME, TO CHANGE ITS ORDERING AND BILLING PROCEDURES EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING SUCH CHANGES ON THIS WEBSITE.
Suncast has the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, this Website, any merchandise or services advertised by Suncast through this Website, or any User’s right to access or use any portion of this Website, in Suncast’s sole discretion, at any time and without prior notice, for any reason, including without limitation: (1) attempts by User (or other party) to gain unauthorized access to this Website or assist others in attempting to do so, (2) User (or other party) disabling any security features on this Website, (3) User’s violation of these Terms, (4) failure of User to pay for merchandise or services ordered hereunder or any related charges, (5) suspected or actual infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights, or (6) pursuant to requests by law enforcement or other government agencies.  The obligations and liabilities of User incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of these Terms for all purposes.  USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SUNCAST SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO USER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION OR DISCONTINUANCE OF THIS WEBSITE OR ANY MERCHANDISE OR SERVICES ADVERTISED ON THIS WEBSITE OR ORDERED BY USER THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.
Orders
To purchase any merchandise and/or services on this Website, User must (a) be legally permitted to enter into a legally binding contract (at least eighteen (18) years old in most jurisdictions), and (b) be a naturalized person residing in, one of the 50 states of the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico. Prior to the purchase of any merchandise or services on this Website, User must provide a valid credit card number (or other payment method acceptable to Suncast) and related payment information, including all of the following:  (i) User’s name exactly as it appears on the credit card, (ii) User’s credit card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge User’s credit card.  By submitting that information, User hereby authorizes Suncast to charge User’s credit card for such purchases.  The risk of loss and title for all merchandise ordered on this Website passes to User when the merchandise is delivered to the shipping carrier.
USER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS TO SUNCAST THAT USER IS AUTHORIZED TO ENTER INTO AND BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. By ordering merchandise or services on this Website, User shall be deemed to have ordered the specified merchandise and/or services from Suncast pursuant to these Terms.  The acceptance and fulfillment by Suncast of any Order placed on this Website is subject to User’s acceptance of and compliance with all of these Terms.  User accepts these Terms by placing an Order through this Website or by receiving delivery of any merchandise ordered by User from this Website.  All other contrary terms and conditions are hereby rejected by Suncast, and no addition or modification to these Terms shall be binding unless specifically agreed to in writing by Suncast.  Suncast shall not be deemed to have accepted User’s Order unless and until Suncast sends to User, through electronic means or other written communication, an acknowledgment that User’s Order has been received and accepted by Suncast, and will be fulfilled by Suncast.  Suncast’s acceptance of any Order by User is made only with the express understanding that these Terms shall govern any Order placed by User.
All prices for merchandise and services on this Website are quoted in U.S. currency, are valid and effective only in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico and are subject to change at any time without notice. User shall be responsible for any tax or other governmental charge related to the sale, use or delivery of the merchandise or services, including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, retailer’s occupational tax, and value added tax.  Suncast shall automatically charge User’s credit card and withhold the applicable tax for Orders to be delivered to addresses in any states, localities or other jurisdictions that it deems is required, however Suncast’s failure to do so shall not relieve User of any liability for such taxes.
Merchandise availability is subject to change at any time. Suncast makes no representations or warranties regarding the availability of merchandise in all areas.  Suncast shall have the right to refuse or cancel any Orders for merchandise and/or services listed at an incorrect price or rebate amount, or containing any other incorrect information or typographical errors.  Suncast shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such Orders whether or not the Order has been accepted by Suncast and/or User’s credit card has been debited.  If User’s credit card has already been charged for the Order and User’s Order is refused or canceled, Suncast shall promptly issue a credit to User’s credit card account in the amount of the charge.
All payments for Orders on this Website must be made by [VISA, MasterCard, or American Express]. Except as may be expressly set forth on this Website, Suncast does not accept any other payment form.  User’s credit card agreement with the issuer of such card shall govern User’s use of such credit card, and User must look only to that agreement and not to these Terms to determine User’s rights and obligations relating thereto.  User agrees to pay all fees and charges, including taxes incurred in connection with User’s Orders, at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred.  Unless User notifies Suncast of any discrepancies in charges for Orders placed through this Website within sixty (60) days after they first appear on User’s credit card statement, User agrees that such charges will be deemed accepted by User for all purposes hereunder.  In the event Suncast does not receive payment from User’s credit card issuer or its agent, User shall pay all amounts due upon demand by Suncast.  User shall remain responsible for any unauthorized charges to or Orders using User’s credit card including unauthorized use by a third party.  If Suncast does not receive payments when they are due, then User agrees to pay all amounts owed to Suncast upon demand by Suncast. If Suncast is unable to collect amounts owed on User’s accounts, Suncast may refer those accounts to a collection agency, and User will be responsible for all costs of collection.
Policy for Return of Merchandise. By placing an Order on this Website, User indicates that User has read and agrees to the Suncast Policy on Returns, Pricing, Ordering, and Shipping Returns Policy. The Returns Policy may be changed from time to time and is effective immediately after Suncast posts such changes on this Website. In addition, when using particular services on this Website, User agrees that User is subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to any such services User uses through this Website, that may be posted on this Website from time to time. Any such posted policies or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.
In states where Suncast has no physical presence, Suncast is not required to collect and remit sales tax for merchandise and services purchased through the Website. However, many states require that their residents file a sales or use tax return for merchandise or services purchased online.  User should consult User’s state and local tax laws to determine compliance with tax laws and regulations in User’s geographic area.  In some states, Suncast collects and remits sales tax.  For purchases where sales tax is applicable, the tax calculated will be reflected on the checkout page before User is asked to confirm the purchase.  Suncast uses commercial reasonable efforts to calculate and remit the correct amount of tax required on each taxable purchase, but Suncast does not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax Suncast represents to User as the tax owed.  Minor errors may occur owing to the inability to accurately track multiple taxing districts, state and local “tax holidays,” the timing of rate changes or the application of certain taxes to categories of items advertised on this Website.  As a result of any error, Suncast may overcollect or undercollect the tax.  In consideration of Suncast allowing User access to and use of the Website, and in collecting and remitting taxes required on User’s purchases, User hereby waives its right to claim that the tax collected on any purchase is incorrect in any respect and agree to hold harmless Suncast, its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (and those of its affiliates), for any harm or other damages User may incur as a result of Suncast’s error in calculating the taxes User on User’s purchases.
Suncast does not ship to P.O. Boxes.
