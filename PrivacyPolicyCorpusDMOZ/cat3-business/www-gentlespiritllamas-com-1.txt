Affiliate Products
Some of the products
sold in The Gentle Spirit Store
are sold using an affiliate

example, a book sold in The
Gentle Spirit Store will have
an affiliate link to Amazon.com.
You purchase the book from Amazon.com.

Information
I Collect and How I Use It
I
will never, ever give away,
sell, rent, lease or trade your

any other personal information
you provide. This is your private,
personal information and I respect
that.
Subscribing
to The
Gentle Spirit Newsletter: Subscribing
to the Newsletter is free.
The only required information
collected is a name you provide
so the newsletter is addressed
personally to you; and the
email address you want your
newsletter emailed to. While
subscribing you will have
the opportunity to provide
optional information, such
as if you own llamas or alpacas.
This optional information
is used to help me deliver
content, articles, education,
information and products which
meet the needs of the newsletter
subscribers.

a consultation is requested
I will use your email address
and phone number only to communicate
with you for the purposes of
fulfilling your request for
a consultation. This is your
private information and will
never be used for any purpose
other than communicating with
you.
The Gentle
Spirit Store: If
you choose not to use Paypal
to purchase products I will
ask you to purchase using
a check or money order mailed
to me, and a name and shipping
address to send your purchase
to.
I will never,
ever give away, sell, rent,
lease or trade any information
on your check or money order;

provide. The information will
