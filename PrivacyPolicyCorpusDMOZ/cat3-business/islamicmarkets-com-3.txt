How We Share Information3.1 Our ServicesProfileYour profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Centre, your settings, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, MessagesOur Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).In a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings.Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable.Subject to your settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile.When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g. likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others.Enterprise AccountsYour employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, IslamicMarkets Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.3.2 Communication ArchivalSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.3.3 Others’ ServicesSubject to your settings, other services may look-up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your IslamicMarkets contacts into its own service. You may revoke the link with such accounts.Subject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user a “mini” IslamicMarkets profile of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). “Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or start conversations with your followers on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.3.4 Related ServicesWe will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, IslamicMarkets Publications will recommend better content to you based on your IslamicMarkets profile or the articles you read on the IslamicMarkets Services, and we can personalise your feed or job recommendations based on your learning video history, because we are able to identify you across different Services using cookies or similar technologies.We share your data across our different Services and IslamicMarkets-affiliated entities.3.5 Service ProvidersWe use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.We may use others to help us with our Services.3.6 Legal DisclosuresIt is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you, (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (4) protect the security or integrity of our Service (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of IslamicMarkets, our Members, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.3.7 Change in Control or SaleWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events.
