C. AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Subscriptions, which may start with a promotional rate, will auto-renew at the end of the cycle stated at the time of your order (“Billing Period”) unless and until you cancel the subscription or we terminate it. For promotional periods of less than one month, you will not receive a notice from Golden Peak Media that the promotional period is ending. You can pay for an automatically renewing subscription in U.S. dollars with a major credit card (“Payment Method”) or select the “Bill Me” option, to the extent such option is offered for a particular purchase. If you have created an Account, you may edit a Payment Method by logging in to your Account. Otherwise, you may edit the Payment Method by calling the customer service number associated with your subscription. By ordering a subscription, you authorize Golden Peak Media to charge you the subscription fee then in effect at the beginning of each Billing Period, plus applicable taxes, to your Payment Method. Golden Peak Media will charge the subscription fee at the start of your subscription or, if applicable, at the end of your free trial period, and will automatically charge the rate then in effect on the first calendar day of each Billing Period thereafter unless and until your subscription is cancelled. You acknowledge that the amount charged each Billing Period may vary for reasons that may include the expiration of promotional rates, price changes, changes to your subscription, or changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize Golden Peak Media to charge your Payment Method for such varying amount each Billing Period. For subscriptions of one year or longer, Golden Peak Media will notify you of the next Billing Period charge, including all applicable taxes and fees, approximately 45 days prior to the credit charge, or renewal date if you have selected “Bill Me.” You will have up to one business day to cancel or the Payment Method will be charged. Golden Peak Media reserves the right to change the timing of billing, in particular, in the event your Payment Method has not successfully settled. If your Payment Method is declined for a recurring payment of your subscription fee or if you selected “Bill Me” and have not paid by the time the subscription renews, you have three days to provide us a new Payment Method or make payment or your subscription will be canceled.
D. One-Time Purchases. When you purchase a stand-alone product, such as a gift subscription, we will charge your Payment Method at the time of purchase.
E. CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS. You can cancel your subscription at any time. You must cancel your subscription at least one day before it renews each Billing Period to avoid charging of the next Billing Period’s subscription fees to your Payment Method. If you cancel during a Bill Period, you will (1) receive a refund for all unmailed magazines, or (2) for digital subscriptions, you will be able to access the content for the remainder of the Bill Period but will not receive a refund.
