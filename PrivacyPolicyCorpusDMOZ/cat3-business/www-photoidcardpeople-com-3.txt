Cookie Policy
Like most websites, this one uses cookies.
Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser. They're used for many things, such as
remembering whether you've visited the site before, so that you remain logged in - or to help us work out
how many new website visitors we get each month. They contain information about the use of your computer but
don't include personal information about you (they don't store your name, for instance).
This policy explains how cookies are used on Photo ID Card People websites in general - and, below, how you
can control the cookies that may be used on this site (not all of them are used on every site).
About this Cookie policy

In this Cookie Policy, when we refer to any of our Websites, we mean any website or mobile application

By accessing the Website, you agree that this Cookie Policy will apply whenever you access the Website on any
device.
Any changes to this policy will be posted here. We reserve the right to vary this Cookie Policy from time to
time and such changes shall become effective as soon as they are posted. Your continued use of the Website
constitutes your agreement to all such changes.
Our use of cookies

You can choose, below, not to allow cookies. If you do, we can't guarantee that your experience with the
Website will be as good as if you do allow cookies.
The information collected by cookies does not personally identify you; it includes general information about
your computer settings, your connection to the Internet e.g. operating system and platform, IP address, your
browsing patterns and timings of browsing on the Website and your location.
Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can change the settings of your browser to erase

Types of cookie that may be used during your visit to the Website:
The following types of cookie are used on this site. We don't list every single cookie used by name - but for
each type of cookie we tell you how you can control its use.
1. Personalisation cookies
These cookies are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Website and in conjunction with other
information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information (that is, about the way you arrive at
the Website, pages you view, options you select, information you enter and the path you take through the
Website). These are used to recommend content we think you'll be interested in based on what you're looked
at before.
2. Analytics cookies
These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is used so that we can
see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
You can opt out of these if you want:
Google: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
3. Third-party service cookies
Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other companies. These companies may drop
cookies on your computer when you use them on our site or if you are already logged in to them.
Here is a list of places where you can find out more about specific services that we may use and their use of
cookies:

Twitter's privacy policy: https://twitter.com/privacy
YouTube video player cookie policy: http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/faq/#toc-cookies(Google's
standard terms).

4. Our own ad serving and management cookies
We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers - they pay for the content you enjoy for free.
As part of this, we use several services to help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be
interested in. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information
about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual). But they might hold a record of what other websites
you've looked at - so we could show you a car advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.
These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. Please note that turning off advertising
cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your
interests.
Google Adsense (ad partner): Privacy policy at https://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&utm_medium=link&gsessionid=DyXLmLB1J1MxXckh6tX6AQ&utm_campaign=ww-ww-et-asfe_&utm_source=aso&answer=48182 and
opt-out via https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.
5. Other ad management cookies
Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. Our advertising partners will serve
advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your
visit to the Website and other websites. In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a
cookie on your computer. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal
information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, about cookies, and about how to turn
this feature off, please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely
that it will not be tailored to your interests.
6. Site management cookies
These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. For instance, where our websites run
on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server
(otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to
ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not
logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments
up/down more than once).
These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change your browser setting to refuse all
cookies (see above) if you do not wish to accept them.
