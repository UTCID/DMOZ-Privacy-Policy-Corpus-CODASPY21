VI.	COOKIES POLICY
Like many online platforms, Schwan's and its analytics vendors use server logs and automated data collection tools, such as browser cookies, pixel tags, scripts and web beacons. These tools are used for analytics purposes to enable Schwan's to understand how users interact with the Offerings, including the sites.
Schwan's and its analytics vendors may tie the information gathered by these means to the identity of users.
Cookies are small text files placed on a computer or device while browsing the Internet.
Cookies are used to collect, store and share bits of information about user activities.
Schwan's uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies are used to identify a particular visit to Schwan's sites and collect information about your interaction with the sites.
These cookies expire after a short time or when the user closes their web browser after using the sites.
Schwan's uses these cookies to identify a user during a single browsing session, such as when you log into the sites.
This helps Schwan's improve the Offerings, including the sites, as well as improve the users' browsing experience.
A persistent cookie will remain on a user's device for a set period of time specified in the cookie.
Schwan's uses these cookies to identify and recognize a specific user over a longer period of time.
They allow Schwan's to:
analyze the usage of the sites (e.g. what links users click on) in order to improve our offering;
test different versions of the sites to see which particular features or content users prefer to optimize the sites;
provide a more personalized experience to users with more relevant content and course recommendations; and
allow users to more easily log in to use the sites.
Examples of persistent cookies include:
(i) preferences cookies to remember information about a user's browser and settings preferences, such as preferred language – preference cookies make a user's experience more functional and customized; (ii) authentication and security cookies to enable a user to log in or stay logged in to access the sites, to protect user accounts against fraudulent log-ins by others and to help detect and protect against abuse or unauthorized usage of user accounts; and (iii) functional cookies to make the experience of using the sites better, like remembering the sound volume level selected by the user.
Schwan's uses tracking technology to: (i) determine if a certain page was visited or whether an email sent by Schwan's was opened or clicked on by a user; and (ii) to customize the experience of individual users by recommending specific content.
We also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and clicked on by recipients.
We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of the sites, to improve the usability of the sites and for marketing purposes.
We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our sites, and to personalize our sites for you.
Cookies and information captured through our sites are stored for a certain retention period, however you can eliminate these cookies any time before the expiration date.
VII. HOW TO ADJUST AND/OR RESTRICT COOKIES
To easily learn more about the types of cookies we use or to make updates to your preferences, click here to Manage Cookies.
If you'd prefer to manually adjust the settings in your browser in order to restrict or block cookies that are set by the sites (or any other website on the Internet), you may visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Alternatively, you can control and delete cookies through your browser settings through the following links:
Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Safari
Opera
Microsoft Internet Explorer
Microsoft Edge
Safari for iOS (iPhone and iPad)
Chrome for Android
Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact the functionality of the Offerings.
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.
Additional general information about cookies, including how to be notified about the placement of new cookies and how to disable cookies, can be found at www.allaboutcookies.org.
VIII.	LINKING SITES
The sites contain links to other websites.
Schwan's is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, including any websites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with us (such as co-branded pages or "powered by" or "in cooperation with" relationships).
We do not share information we gather with other websites or any other entities or individuals unless such sharing is disclosed to you in advance through this Notice.
Other linked websites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not subject to our control.
To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policy of the websites you may visit by linking from the sites (including by linking through social media features on the sites, such as through a Facebook "Like" button).
Please note that this Notice applies only to our sites, and not to other companies' or organizations' websites to which we link.
On certain sites, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to enable you to purchase an Offering or make payments on a third-party payment service provider website ("Payment Service"). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a page operated by that Payment Service. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Notice. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service.
IX.	SOCIAL MEDIA
As noted above, one source through which we may collect information is from social media platforms (which may share information about how you interact with our social media content).
We do not control how your personal information is collected, stored or used by such third-party websites or to whom it is disclosed.
You should review the privacy policies and settings on any social media website that you subscribe to so that you understand the information they collect and may be sharing.
If you do not want a social media website to share information about you, you must contact that website and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt-out of sharing such information.
Schwan's is not responsible for how these third-party websites may use information collected from or about you.
X.	HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
We generally retain your information as long as reasonably necessary to comply with our document retention policy and applicable law, applicable statute of limitations, or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
XI.	MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing and promotional messages from Schwan's, if those messages are powered by Schwan's, by following the instructions in those messages.
If you decide to unsubscribe, you will still receive non-promotional communications relevant to your use of our Offerings.
XII.	CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT (COPPA) COMPLIANCE AND RELATED INFORMATION
None of our sites are intended for children under 16 years of age. It is our policy to refrain from knowingly collecting or maintaining personal information relating to any person under the age of 16.
If you are under the age of 16, please do not supply any personal information through the sites.
If you are under the age of 16 and have already provided personal information through the sites, please have your parent or guardian contact us immediately using the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION so that we can remove such information from our files.
If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at CONTACT INFORMATION.
XIII.	SECURITY
We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
We hold information about you both at our own premises and with the assistance of third-party service providers.
Further public disclosure here of our security measures could aid those who might attempt to circumvent those security measures.
If you have additional questions regarding security, please feel free to contact us directly using the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION.
To ensure that our employees comply with our privacy policies, we have developed a training program that provides all employees with the tools and knowledge to protect your personal information in all aspects of their work.
Any employee who violates our privacy policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.
XIV.	CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") permits residents of California to have the following additional rights.
For more information, or if you have questions, you can contact us using the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION.
For your protection, Schwan's is required to collect certain information from you to verify your identity before we respond to any request submitted by you.
The information you provide to verify your identity will only be used for verification purposes, and a record of your request, including certain information contained within it, will be maintained by Schwan's for its files.
1.	California Residents Have The Right To Request Schwan's Disclose What Information It Collects, Uses And Discloses
California residents have the right to request that Schwan's disclose what personal information Schwan's collected, used, and disclosed about them over the past 12 months.
You may make such a request no more than twice in any 12-month period.
The general categories of personal information Schwan's collects about California residents are listed above under WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
If you are a California resident and would like to request the personal information that Schwan's collects, uses and discloses about you, please use the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION to contact Schwan's.
To verify any request regarding the personal information Schwan's collects, uses, and discloses about you, you will be required to provide information to verify your identity (e.g., name, address, and e-mail address).
Failure to do so could result in Schwan's inability to comply with your request.
2.	California Residents Have The Right To Request Deletion Of Their Personal Information Maintained By Schwan's
California residents have the right to request that Schwan's delete the personal information Schwan's maintains about them, subject to certain exceptions.
Schwan's will make every effort to comply with California residents' requests to delete their personal information; however, certain laws or other legal requirements might prevent some personal information from being deleted.
If you are a California resident and would like to request the deletion of your personal information, please use the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION and contact Schwan's.
To verify any request to delete personal information, you will be required to provide information to verify your identity (e.g., name, address, and e-mail address).
Failure to do so could result in Schwan's inability to comply with your request.
3.	California Residents Have The Right To Non-Discrimination For The Exercise Of Their Privacy Rights Under The CCPA
Under the CCPA, California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Schwan's for the exercise of their privacy rights.
However, the exercise of certain privacy rights by California residents will make it so that Schwan's is no longer able to provide those residents with certain aspects of the Offerings.
For example, if, at the request of a California resident, Schwan's deletes all of the California resident's personal information that it maintains, Schwan's will no longer be able to send marketing communications to that California resident unless that California resident re-submits personal information to Schwan's.
4.	California Residents Can Designate An Authorized Agent To Make A Request Under The CCPA On Their Behalf
California residents can designate an authorized agent to make requests under the CCPA related to the residents' personal information.
Schwan's can deny any request made by an agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized by the California resident to act on the California resident's behalf.
For more information on submitting a request on behalf of a California resident as an authorized agent, you can contact us using the information provided under CONTACT INFORMATION.
5.	No Sale Of Information
Schwan's has not, in the last 12 months, sold your information, nor does Schwan's have plans to sell your information in the future.
6.	Do Not Track
Do Not Track ("DNT") is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking across websites.
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, so we do not take any action in response to this signal.
Schwan's does not have a mechanism in place to respond to DNT signals.
Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this Notice to manage the collection and use of information about you.
Schwan's tracks some activity across websites (including your search terms, the website you visited before you visited or used the sites and other clickstream data) and we may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Notice from web browsers that have enabled DNT signals or similar mechanisms.
XV.	CHANGES TO THIS NOTICE
Please check this Notice periodically for changes - this Notice may be revised from time to time as we add new features and Offerings, as laws change and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve.
The effective date is listed on the top of this Notice so you can easily identify when there has been a change.
If we make any material change to this Notice regarding the use or disclosure of personal information, we will provide notice of the change on our sites and the change will apply to information collected after the change becomes effective.
Small changes or changes that do not significantly affect individual privacy interests may be made at any time and without prior notice.
Your use of any site constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this Notice and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised Notice.
