You must use the same Account when converting Points to Point Rewards and cannot combine and convert Points accumulated in separate Accounts into Point Rewards.
3.3. Redeeming Punches
You may only redeem Punches for a free Reward Product at participating 7-Eleven stores in the U.S. You will qualify for one free Reward Product based upon the applicable number of Punches (as we may specify) you have properly recorded to your Account and/or 7Rewards Card. If you have created an Account and have properly linked and recorded the applicable number of Punches (as we may specify) to your Account, your Account will be updated so that you can scan to receive your free Reward Product. You must use the same Account when redeeming Punches and cannot combine Punches accumulated in separate Accounts to redeem your free Reward Product. At this time, Punches may not be redeemed in the 7-Eleven NOW App.
4. MISCELLANEOUS
4.1. Prohibited Conduct
In addition to the restrictions you agreed to in 7-Eleven’s Terms, you agree that any fraud, attempted fraud, suspected fraud, or abuse of the Program or these Program Terms is expressly prohibited and engaging in any of these activities will be grounds for immediate termination and disqualification from the Program and may lead to the forfeiture of all earned Points and Punches.
4.2. Expiration
POINTS AND PUNCHES WHICH HAVE ACCUMULATED BY A PRE-ENROLLED PARTICIPANT WILL EXPIRE SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE POINT OR PUNCH IS EARNED UNLESS THE 7REWARDS CARD OR PHONE NUMBER IS LINKED TO AN ACCOUNT BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF SUCH SIXTY (60) DAY PERIOD. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, ALL ACCUMULATED POINTS AND PUNCHES IN YOUR ACCOUNT WILL AUTOMATICALLY EXPIRE IF FOR NINETY (90) CONSECUTIVE DAYS YOU HAVE NOT EITHER (I) USED YOUR ACCOUNT TO PROPERLY EARN AND RECORD POINTS OR OTHERWISE HAD PROMOTIONAL POINTS AWARDED TO YOUR ACCOUNT (WHICH WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD), (II) PROPERLY CONVERTED POINTS IN YOUR ACCOUNT TO A MY REWARD, (III) USED YOUR ACCOUNT TO PROPERLY EARN AND RECORD PUNCHES, OR (IV) PROPERLY REDEEMED A MY REWARD IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

A replacement 7Rewards Card can be obtained at a 7-Eleven participating location. If the lost or stolen 7Rewards Card is linked to your Account, your registration profile and the accumulated, unredeemed Points, Punches and My Rewards at the time such card is rendered inactive will remain intact. If the lost or stolen 7Rewards Card is not linked to your Account, your accumulated Points and Punches at the time such card is lost or stolen will also be lost and unrecoverable. We are not responsible for any Points, Punches or My Rewards used by a third party using a lost or stolen 7Rewards Card, and if the lost or stolen 7Rewards Card is not linked to your Account we are not responsible for the use or loss of any of your Points and Punches. Should the security of your Account be compromised, including in the event your mobile phone or other electronic device capable of accessing your Account is lost, stolen or compromised, you should re-set your Account password immediately. We are not responsible for any Points, Punches or My Rewards used by a third party accessing your Account.

Part Three – TERMS APPLICABLE TO USE OF THE 7-ELEVEN NOW APP and the 7-ELEVEN NOW WEBSITEThese terms govern the purchase and sale of Products from and by 7-Eleven through the 7-Eleven NOW App and the 7-Eleven NOW Website.
1. 7-Eleven NOW Services
7-Eleven wants to make the Products you love available to you in ways that are convenient to you. In furthering this mission, we created the 7-Eleven NOW application (the “7-Eleven NOW App”) and the 7-Eleven NOW website (the “7-Eleven NOW Website,” together with the 7-Eleven NOW App, collectively the “7-Eleven NOW Service”), which give users the capability to order Products for delivery. The 7-Eleven NOW Service is currently beta software, meaning that are still in development and may not function fully or may not function without error. During this test phase, delivery services are limited to participating locations. All Orders placed using the 7-Eleven NOW Service are subject to availability and your acceptance of these Terms.
2. Acceptance of Order
Your placement of an Order does not necessarily assure that we will accept your Order. We reserve the right to refuse any Order in our sole discretion for any reason, including but not limited to lack of availability, errors on the 7-Eleven NOW Service, and/or errors in the Order. Once a properly completed Order is received, authorization of your form of payment is received and we have accepted your Order, we will begin preparing your Order for pickup or delivery, as applicable, and will send you an Order Confirmation.
3. Guest Checkout
You must have a valid, active Account to use the 7-Eleven NOW Service. If you do not have an Account, you may create one at the time of your Order. Accounts are subject to the terms set forth in Part Two above.
4. Pricing and Availability
All prices are shown in U.S. dollars, and taxes, shipping and handling charges (if any) are additional. PRICES, PROMOTIONS AND OFFERS DISPLAYED IN THE 7-ELEVEN NOW SERVICE ARE SOMETIMES DIFFERENT THAN THE PRICES, PROMOTIONS AND OFFERS THAT ARE DISPLAYED IN, OR ADVERTISED FOR, OUR 7-ELEVEN STORES OR ON THE 7-ELEVEN APP. FOR EXAMPLE, SOMETIMES 7-ELEVEN NOW SERVICE PRICES WILL BE HIGHER THAN IN-STORE IN IN-7REWARDS APP PRICES. We reserve the right to charge a “Small Basket Fee” if your Order does not exceed a minimum amount, which may vary by area. You will be advised of any applicable Small Basket Fee prior to checkout. At the present, you may not redeem rewards, coupons or other promotions offered as a part of the 7Rewards Program for Orders placed via the 7-Eleven NOW Service. All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to discontinue offering certain Products and to substitute Products without prior notice. We strive to provide you with high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain Products and market conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at 800-255-0711.
The delivery fee quoted at checkout may be different than the actual delivery fee for your Order. Differences may occur based on changing availability of drivers, changes in traffic, and other factors between the time your submit your Order and the time your Order is dispatched for delivery and are determined solely by our third party delivery partners. You agree to pay any such differences in delivery fee and that 7-Eleven is under no obligation to inform you of such changes before charging your payment method for the actual delivery fee.
5. Payment and Billing Information
By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, an “Order”). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be cancelled. You must resolve any payment method problems before we proceed with your Order. If you want to delete your payment method or add a new payment method, you can do so at any time by accessing your “wallet” within the 7-Eleven NOW Service.
In some cases, we (or our third party payment processor) may authorize or reserve a charge on your payment method. The authorization is not a charge. However, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount. In the event that the amount of our authorization exceeds the total funds on deposit in your payment account, you may be subject to overdraft or non-sufficient funds charges by the bank issuing your payment method. We are not responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.
When checking out within the 7-Eleven NOW Service, you may choose to store your credit / debit card information for future use. This information will not be stored by 7-Eleven but by our payment processor, Stripe. This information will only be used to pay for purchases through the 7-Eleven NOW Service when you choose to use the stored card.
6. Points for Purchases
Purchases made through the 7-Eleven NOW Service are not eligible to earn or accumulate 7Rewards Points. From time-to-time, we may, in our discretion, award promotional points in association with purchases made through the 7-Eleven NOW Service but are under no obligation to do so.
7. Deliveries
Once you place your Order, you will be provided with an estimated delivery time at checkout. This time is only an estimate and your actual delivery time may be longer or shorter depending on a variety of factors including, among others, traffic, distance, availability of delivery agents at any given time, and weather. You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. 7-Eleven reserves the right to charge you the full Order amount if you or your designated recipient is not at the designated delivery location when the delivery agent arrives to complete the delivery as well as a restocking or return fee. For deliveries containing alcohol or other age-restricted products, see Section 11 below for additional requirements. You acknowledge that transportation or logistics services are provided by third party independent contractors who are not employed by 7-Eleven.
8. Cancellations; Refunds
You cannot make changes to, or cancel, an Order once it is placed. If you are dissatisfied with any Products in your Order, please contact us at 800-255-0711. We reserve the right to, in our sole discretion, issue a refund or replacement products, or take no action.
9. Taxes
We will collect applicable sales tax on Products shipped in the states for which we determine we have a duty to collect sales tax. If a Product is subject to sales tax, you agree that the amount of taxes shown at checkout may be adjusted. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates.
10. Product Information Disclosures
While we work to ensure that Product information is correct, on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists. Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and/or different information than that shown via the 7-Eleven NOW Service, at a 7-Eleven store, or in an Order confirmation. For these reasons you should not rely on the information presented, but should always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a Product. For additional information about a Product, please contact the manufacturer. Information and statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Neither 7-Eleven, its content provider(s) nor Product manufacturers assume any liability for inaccuracies, misstatements, or omissions. In the event of an error, whether on the 7-Eleven NOW Service, at a 7-Eleven store, in an Order confirmation or in processing an Order, or delivering a Product, we reserve the right to correct such error and revise your Order accordingly (including charging the correct price) or to cancel the Order and refund any amount charged.
11. Orders Containing Alcohol
You may have the option to order alcohol Products from participating locations. You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and not cause 7-Eleven to contravene any applicable laws. You agree that you are 21 years of age or older if you order alcohol Products. You agree to provide valid government-issued identification during the ordering process and again upon pick-up or delivery of alcohol Products. You agree that we cannot deliver alcohol Products to “dry” areas or areas where possession of alcohol is otherwise prohibited, or to persons who are under the legal age or who, in the sole determination of the delivery agent, are intoxicated when receiving delivery of such Products. Lastly, you agree that if any applicable legal requirements for the delivery of alcohol are not met, 7-Eleven reserves the right to cancel either the alcohol-related portion, or your entire Order, in its sole discretion.
12. No Resale
You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products for commercial purposes.

Part Five
– 7-Eleven Gift Card Terms and Conditions1.
About the 7-Eleven Gift Card
The 7-Eleven Gift Card (the “Card”) is a gift card that customers
may preload with a dollar value and use to purchase goods and services in
participating 7-Eleven stores. This dollar value is a prepayment for the goods
and services of participating 7-Eleven stores located in the United States.
These Terms and Conditions (the
“Card Terms”) are subject to,
and made a part of, the Terms, and apply to your access to the Card service.
The Card Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other
agreement you may have with us in respect of any products, services or
otherwise. To the extent there is a conflict between the Card Terms and any
other 7-Eleven terms applicable to you, the Card Terms will govern such
conflict.
Unless otherwise required by
law or provided in these Terms, the dollar value on your Card is nonrefundable
and may not be redeemed for cash. The dollar value in your Card is not insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and does not earn interest.
2.
Loading Value to Your Card
The Card is reloadable. In the
United States, you can load value to your Card by visiting any participating
7-Eleven store. You may load value to your Card using a debit card, a credit
card, cash (at participating 7-Eleven stores), Apple Pay or Google Pay. The
value that you load to your Card may take up to 24 hours to become available
for use. Once a dollar value is loaded to your Card, the transaction cannot be
reversed.
The minimum amount that you may
load to a Card is $5. The maximum amount that you may load is $100.
3.
Exclusions
You
may not use a Card to purchase lottery tickets, gift cards and money orders.
Cards are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.
4.

We do not charge any
activation, service, dormancy or inactivity fees in connection with your Card
or the prepaid value held therein. Your Card and the prepaid value held therein
has no expiration date.
5.
Promotions
We may, from time to time, in
our sole discretion offer promotional programs associated with Cards. Each
promotional program is subject to the Card Terms and may also be subject to
additional terms associated with the promotional program. Please review these
additional terms carefully and be aware that we reserve the right to modify
them at any time without notice to you.
6.
Receipts and Transaction History
You may request a receipt each
time that you use your Card to purchase goods and services at a participating
7-Eleven store. The receipt will identify your Card as the payment method and
indicate the remaining prepaid value balance on your Card.
You may check your Card balance
by visiting a participating 7-Eleven store and requesting a balance receipt or
by calling Customer Support at 1-866-520-4842. We will not mail you an account
statement in connection with your Card. It is your responsibility to maintain
your own receipts and monitor your transaction history and account balance to
detect clerical, billing or accounting errors, fraud and unauthorized
transactions.
7.
Billing Errors, Corrections
In the event that you believe
we have made a clerical, billing or accounting error with respect to the value
maintained in your Card, please contact us at 1-866-520-4842. We will review your claim and correct any error
that we discover. If we do not find an error, we will provide support for our
finding. We will have no obligation to review or correct any billing error
unless you provide us sufficient notice for us to review your claim within
sixty (60) days of the date of the transaction in question.
8.
Lost or Stolen Card
Risk of loss and title for card passes to purchaser on
transfer. You must therefore keep your Card in a safe place. If your Card is
lost or stolen, the Card and the value maintained on the Card cannot be
replaced. 7-Eleven is not responsible for any lost or stolen Cards or use of a
Card without your permission.

that you load to your Wallet may take up to 24 hours to become available for
use. Once a dollar value is loaded to your Wallet, the transaction cannot be
reversed.
You may link a payment method

inputting payment method information into the Wallet mobile application.
The value that you maintain in
your Wallet cannot exceed $1,000 in any single day.

minimum amount required to set up your Wallet is $5.
[You may also opt to
automatically reload a preset amount of value to your Wallet when the value
associated with your Wallet falls below a preset amount or on a weekly or
monthly basis. In order to do so, you will be required to link a payment method
to your Wallet account. We will send you a notification confirming the
automatic reload terms and bill your payment method according to the schedule
and amount you have selected. We will also send you a notification after each
reload to let you know your Wallet has been reloaded. You can change your
reload preferences at any time, but changes may take up to twenty-four (24)
hours to go into effect.
You may discontinue the
automatic reload feature by tapping on Wallet in the 7-Eleven Mobile App and
going to “Manage Wallet”.
