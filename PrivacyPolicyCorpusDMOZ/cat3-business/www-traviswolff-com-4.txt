In today’s ever more competitive legal market, many law firms face challenges in day-to-day operations that prevent them from growing or having a strategic focus on the future. These challenges are multifaceted and may include: general counsel pricing pressures, industry consolidation, commoditization of certain practice areas, retirement of rainmaking partners, cybersecurity threats, generational culture differences and partner compensation issues.
Armanino’s analytical approach offers an informed perspective to help you overcome these hurdles. We perform leadership interviews, profitability analysis and external market analysis with information gleaned from your peer firms via our law firm benchmarking survey. We examine the various aspects of your firm, including interviewing your partners, to gain a true understanding of your culture, operations and strategy.
Our specialists use this information to perform a fact-based diagnostic assessment of your unique situation. We then produce an evaluation with quantitative benchmarks for compensation, technology, rates and demographics. Our recommendations will help your firm build an improved framework to implement growth-oriented change.
