The transfer is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
It is lawful and necessary for the performance of a contract with you.Data transmissions performed outside of the European Union do not generally take place with the high level of protection that exists within Europe. In the case of such a transmission, it may be there is currently no EU Commission adequacy decision within the definition of Art. 45 (1), 3 GDPR. That means that, to date, the Commission has not decided that the level of protection specific to each country corresponds to the level of data protection based on the GDPR, which is why we have created the appropriate safeguards set out above.Possible risks that might not be completely precluded in connection with the transmission of data particularly include:
Your personal data may possibly be processed over and beyond the actual purpose.
There is the possibility that you will not always be able to establish and implement your data protection rights, including, for example, your right to access, correction, erasure and data portability.
