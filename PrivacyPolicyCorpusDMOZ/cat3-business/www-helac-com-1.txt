By registering with or contacting us through Helac Corporation's website, you agree that any information or comments you provide may be shared between Helac Corporation, its affiliated companies and dealers and used without restriction to process customer orders and improve or market our products and services. We will not sell or rent your information to any third party, and will exercise reasonable efforts to keep the information secure. Helac recognizes and respects your online privacy.

Your shopping experience is safe and secure. That means your credit card, your personal information, and your password is safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and stringent limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to the data.
