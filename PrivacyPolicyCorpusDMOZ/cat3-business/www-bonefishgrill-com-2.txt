any of the associated

characteristics, operating system details, language preferences, referring URLs, length of
visits, MAC address and pages viewed. A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on
your hard drive as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer. Many web browsers are set to
accept cookies by default, but you may be able to set your browser to notify you before you
receive a cookie or to remove or reject cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies, you
may not be able to use certain features of the Sites or other websites, and disabling cookies
may invalidate opt-outs that rely on cookies to function.
We may combine certain automatically-collected information with other information we obtain about
you, which may include data we obtain from third parties. Please note that we or third parties may collect personal information about your online
activities over time and across different devices and online properties when you use the
Services.
Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal
when you

respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers. To learn more about
“Do Not Track”
signals, visit www.allaboutdnt.com. Information collected through the Apps. Depending on your personal device and App permission settings, when using the Apps, we may

collect real-time
information about the location of your device (GPS and network-based) to provide requested
location services and to serve you relevant offers or promotions. • Stored information and files. These may allow the Apps to read,
modify, or delete
the contents of your USB storage including photographs, audio and video clips, personal
contacts, and address book information.
• Camera. This may allow the Apps to access the camera to scan and
input payment
method details.
• WiFi connection information. When enabled, this may allow the Apps
to view WiFi
connections.
• Other. The Apps will send and receive data to and from the Internet,
and may view
network connections, have full network access, control vibration of your device, or prevent
your device from sleeping.

achieve the purposes for which the information was collected, or as otherwise required or
permitted under applicable law.

personal information to one or more of our service providers that may share your information
with us. We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from other
parties. When you submit information to another party, you are subject to that third
party’s

other parties, such as social networks (for example, to log in to a restaurant’s WiFi
network or
invite friends to join Dine Rewards). Using these features may allow both BBI and the other

Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites, which may have their own privacy policies or
notices that you should review to understand how they may collect, use, or disclose your
