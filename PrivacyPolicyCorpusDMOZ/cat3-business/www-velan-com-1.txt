Privacy policyVelan Inc. and its affiliates (“Velan”) are committed to the proper management of the personal information of all visitors to our website (the “site”). This privacy policy (the “policy”) describes how we collect, use, disclose, retain and protect personal information.
What is personal information?
It means any information about an identifiable individual (the “information”). Generally, it does not include information on a business card or available in public records, nor does it include corporate information such as your business address or telephone number in your capacity as an employee of an organization.
Collection of personal information
We limit the amount and the type of information we collect and use to that necessary to fulfill several general purposes or as otherwise permitted or required by law:
to fulfill your requests for services and products
to keep you informed and communicate with you about our products and services
to personalize your experience on our site
to administer our records
to fulfill our legal and professional obligations
Your consent
By providing us with your Information, you consent to its collection, use, and disclosure.
Internet server provider
Certain other information may be collected on the site through various technologies without your actively providing the information. Our site is hosted on servers shared with an Internet service provider (ISP). Any Information collected on our behalf by the ISP is managed in accordance with this policy and is protected by applicable law. Certain information about Internet users’ traffic patterns is passively and automatically collected and linked to users’ Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. These unique IP addresses are assigned to all Web users by their ISPs, and are automatically logged by Internet servers. While the IP address itself does not identify an individual, it may be used with the cooperation of the ISP to locate and identify an individual using the website.
Server logs
In the normal course of establishing and maintaining Internet connections, our servers automatically log information about visits to our site. Server logs record statistical information. These statistics are reported in aggregate form to us and are used to improve our site and ensure that it provides the optimal online experience for visitors.
Cookies
Like many other websites, our site makes use of “per session” cookie technology. Per session cookies are small text files that contain a unique identification number that is automatically deposited on a visitor’s computer. These cookies track information during an open session and are stored only temporarily in your computer’s memory. This information helps us determine the total number of visitors to the site on an ongoing basis and the types of Internet browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) and operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh) that our visitors use. We use this information to facilitate and enhance your online visits. We do not cross-reference this information with any type of Information that is voluntarily offered through the site.
The use of cookie technology is common on the Internet, and many Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies automatically. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your Internet browser to notify you when your computer is receiving a cookie or to refuse cookies automatically. To readjust your Internet browser’s cookie options, please refer to the instruction documentation of your particular browser or seek online assistance.
Use of personal information
We use information only as described in this policy or as otherwise permitted or required by law. If we distribute publications to people on our mailing lists, you can change your preferences or unsubscribe from our mailing lists.
Disclosure of personal information
We disclose information only as described in this policy or as otherwise permitted or required by law. To provide products or services, we may sometimes disclose our clients’ Information to Velan affiliates and to third parties (for example, to evaluate creditworthiness or to collect debts or to engage experts or consultants), including foreign agents and government or regulatory agencies, or where such disclosure is required or permitted by law.
Our offices around the world may share your Information for marketing purposes.
Your information may be accessed or stored in Canada or another jurisdiction, and will be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.
Retention of personal information
We will retain information for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected.
Protection of personal information
We use the standard safeguards to protect the security of Information in our possession, including physical, organizational, and technological measures. We cannot guarantee that information will not be lost, used unlawfully or modified in a fraudulent manner, and consequently we bear no liability for the use that may be made of the information.
Your access to your personal information
You can ask to view your Information by writing to the address provided at the end of this policy. You can request that corrections be made when you can show that the Information we possess is inaccurate.
Links to other websites
The site may contain links to other websites. While we try to link only to websites that share our standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites.
Changes to this policy
We may amend this policy at any time. We will post the policy as amended on our site.
