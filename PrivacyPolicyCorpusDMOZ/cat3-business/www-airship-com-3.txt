The security of all Personal Information provided to us is important to us, and we take reasonable steps designed to protect your Personal Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your own passwords. If you have reason to believe that your passwords or Personal Information is no longer secure, please promptly notify us at privacy@airship.com

We retain the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Statement for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws.
10. Are Airship’s Sites for Children?
Due to the nature of our business, Services are not marketed to or intended for minors under the age of 18. Airship does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16.

11. Your privacy rights
Opt-out. Where you have consented to our processing of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by following the instructions in this section. Note that, due to the nature of the Services, you may have to login to your account or provide the email and/or other identifying value that is associated with your Personal Information in order for us to complete your request.
Email unsubcribe. An “Unsubscribe” button will be provided in each email communications sent by us so that you can opt-out. However, we may continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or Services you have requested in response to such request. We may also need to send you certain communications regarding our programs and Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy Statement.
Opt-out of cookies and ads. You may stop or restrict the placement of technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits, or for this Site using the Cookies Settings link at the bottom of the webpage. The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these and learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/, https://youradchoices.ca/choices/, and www.aboutads.info/choices/.  To separately make choices for mobile apps on a mobile device, you can download DAA’s AppChoices application from your device’s app store. Alternatively, for some devices you may use your device’s platform controls in your settings to exercise choice.
Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
Do Not Track. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Airship does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or a mobile device. For information about “do-not-track”, visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org.
Access, correct, amend or delete Personal Information. You may seek confirmation regarding whether we are processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of applicable data protection laws. You have the right to control or change certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Statement.
Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may log into your account or email privacy@airship.com to request access to, receive (port), restrict processing, seek rectification or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by us. Such requests will be processed in accordance with local laws. Although we make good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
EU residents. If you are located in the European Economic Area or the UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your Personal Information violates applicable law.
CA residents. Please refer to the California Privacy Rights page here.
Customer Data. As a data processor for our business customers, we processe data that may include Personal Information of our business customer’s end user clients (“Customer Data”). We will not review, share, distribute or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the agreements between us and our business customers, or as may be required by law. If Personal Information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us by our business customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant customer directly. Because Airship personnel have limited ability to access Customer Data, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of the relevant Airship customer. We will refer your request to that customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request.

We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company, website or digital property before submitting your Personal Information. Some third parties may choose to share their users’ Personal Information with us; that sharing is governed by that company’s privacy policy, not this Privacy Statement.
