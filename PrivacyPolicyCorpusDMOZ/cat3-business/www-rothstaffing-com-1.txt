Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “Cookies”), including for our marketing efforts. “Cookies” are small files of information that a website – when visited by a user- asks your browser to store on your device (e.g., computer, smartphone or tablet) in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any Personally Identifiable Information.
Social Media Cookies
These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.
Targeting Cookies
These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.    They do not store Personally Identifiable Information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
Functional Cookies
These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Links to Other Web Sites
Our Sites may contain links and references to other sites. Roth Staffing encourages you to review the privacy statements of these other sites so that you can understand how your information is collected, used and shared. Roth Staffing assumes no responsibility for the privacy statements or the content on Web sites not maintained by Roth Staffing.
E-Mail Addresses
Roth Staffing is fully committed to only sending you e-mail that you have an interest in receiving. We do not share your e-mail address with other parties at any time for any purpose whatsoever. This includes renting, bartering, selling, leasing or otherwise making your e-mail address available to any other company or organization unless required by a court or law enforcement.
Occasionally, Roth Staffing utilizes e-mail to share valuable information with those candidates who have requested to be kept informed regarding career searches, employment opportunities and special benefits available to them. Candidates may choose to opt out of these distributions at any time.
In addition, Roth Staffing utilizes e-mail to share valuable information with customers who have requested to be kept informed of staffing issues, technological innovations and special offers available to them. Customers may choose to unsubscribe from such e-mail campaign communications at any time by (1) clicking on the “unsubscribe” link that appears in these messages, (2) inputting their relevant e-mail address and (3) clicking “submit” to complete the unsubscribe process.
Roth Staffing utilizes the services of reputable third-party companies for the transmission of e-mail messages. The Company shares recipient email addresses with the third-party companies.  The third-party companies share usage information about recipients of Roth Staffing’s e-mails and visitors to Company Sites for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, Roth Staffing and its third-party e-mail transmission company use tracking (images, javascript, and link tracking) to note your interaction with Company e-mail messages and to record some of the pages you visit on Company Sites. This information allows Roth Staffing to provide information that is tailored to your needs and interests.

You are responsible for managing the types of texts (whether SMS or MMS) you receive.
You expressly consent and agree to accept and receive communications via text message to your mobile device and to the cellular/mobile telephone number(s) that you provided to us. The information in any message may be subject to certain time lags and/or delays.
Frequency of Messages: The number and frequency of SMS/MMS messages sent to your device depends on several factors, including the length of your assignment, number of recently posted jobs matching your search criteria, jobs that you have applied to or your resume, and if you have asked for help or support via text messaging.

How You Can Access or Correct Your Information
If a user’s Personally Identifiable Information changes, such as phone number, e-mail address or address, or if a user no longer desires Roth Staffing services, contact IT Privacy Department by postal mail or e-mail (see below).
“Do Not Track” Signals
Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, our Sites do not currently interpret, respond to or alter their practices when they receive “Do Not Track” signals.
Security
We maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personally Identifiable Information we collect and store from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Children’s Privacy
Our Sites and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under 13.
Notice to Nevada Residents
Nevada law allows Nevada residents to opt-out of the sale of certain types of personal information. Subject to a number of exceptions, Nevada law defines “sale” to mean the exchange of certain types of personal information for monetary consideration to a person for the person to license or sell the information to additional persons. We do not currently sell personal information as defined in the Nevada law. However, if you are a Nevada resident, you still may submit a verified request to opt-out of sales and we will record your instructions and incorporate them in the future if our policy changes. Opt-out requests may be sent to privacy@rothstaffing.com.
Notice to California Residents
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires that we provide California residents with a privacy policy that contains a comprehensive description of our online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal information and of the rights of California residents regarding their personal information.
The CCPA defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Personal information does not include information that is publicly available, deidentified or aggregate information. For purposes of this “Notice to California Residents” section we will refer to this information as “Personal Information.”
The CCPA contains an important limitation that is applicable to Roth Staffing.
Some of the CCPA’s privacy rights described below do not apply to Personal Information that is collected in the course of a natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, or contractor of a business to the extent that the Personal Information is collected and used by the business solely within that context. Because we are a staffing company, much of the Personal Information we collect is subject to that exemption.
Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold
Your Right
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose what Personal Information we have collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request. This right includes the right to request any or all of the following:
Specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you;
Categories of Personal Information we have collected about you;
Categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;
Categories of Personal Information that we sold (if applicable) or disclosed for a business purpose about you;
Categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold (if applicable) or disclosed for a business purpose; and
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or, if applicable, selling Personal Information.
Please note that we are not required to:
Retain any Personal Information about you that was collected for a single one-time transaction if, in the ordinary course of business, that information about you is not retained;
Reidentify or otherwise link any data that, in the ordinary course of business, is not maintained in a manner that would be considered Personal Information; or
Provide the Personal Information to you more than twice in a 12-month period.
The CCPA defines “sell” to mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a California resident’s Personal Information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.
Your privacy is our priority, and we do not monetize your Personal Information by selling it to third parties.
After you visit our Sites and/or use our Services, you may receive advertisements about Roth Staffing’s services when you visit other websites (i.e., social media sites, search engines or other websites that are unrelated to Roth Staffing). This happens because we use third-party vendors to provide you with information about our services based upon your interactions with our website.
These third-party vendors may work with additional providers in their relationship network that help provide the advertising services the third-party vendors provide to us.
Note, we use these third parties only to show you ads about Roth Staffing’s Services (i.e., we do not use third parties to advertise any other company’s products or services to you).
Our third-party vendors and, if applicable, providers in their relationship network, may use the information they collect for purposes that are unrelated to showing you ads about our services.
When this information is used for a purpose other than showing ads about our services or other services we have requested, it may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information under the CCPA. For additional detailed information, please refer to the Disclosure or Sale of Personal Information section below.
How to Submit a Request to Know
If you have an account, you must log into your account and submit your request to know through your account. If you do not have an account, you may submit a request to know through our interactive webform available here or by calling us at 1-888-297-1911.
Our Process for Verifying a Request to Know
You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know twice within a 12-month period.  The verifiable consumer request must describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
If we determine that your request is subject to an exemption, we will notify you of our determination. If we determine that your request is not subject to an exemption, we will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request.
Our verification process may differ depending on whether you maintain a password-protected account with us.
If you maintain a password-protected account, we may verify your identity through existing authentication practices available through your account. Prior to disclosing the requested information, we will ask you to re-authenticate yourself with respect to that account.
If you do not maintain a password-protected account, or if you are an account-holder but we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity with your account, we will verify your identity as follows:
Request to Know Categories of Personal Information: We will verify your identity to a “reasonable degree of certainty” by verifying at least two data points that you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities.
Request to Know Specific Pieces of Personal Information: We will verify your identity to a “reasonably high degree of certainty” by verifying at least three pieces of Personal Information previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable the purpose of verifying identities. In addition, you will be required to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the individual whose Personal Information is being requested.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Collection of Personal Information
The following tables present the categories of Personal Information that we have collected, the categories of sources from which that information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared that Personal Information for the 12 months preceding the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy. For ease of reference, we have divided the tables into the types of Personal Information we collect depending on how you interact with our Services.

Your privacy is our priority, and we do not monetize your Personal Information by selling it to third parties.
After you visit our Sites and/or use our Services, you may receive advertisements about Roth Staffing’s services when you visit other websites (i.e., social media sites, search engines or other websites that are unrelated to Roth Staffing). This happens because we use third-party vendors to provide you with information about our services based upon your interactions with our website.
These third-party vendors may work with additional providers in their relationship network that help provide the advertising services the third-party vendors provide to us.
Note, we use these third parties only to show you ads about Roth Staffing’s Services (i.e., we do not use third parties to advertise any other company’s products or services to you).
Our third-party vendors and, if applicable, providers in their relationship network, may use the information they collect for purposes that are unrelated to showing you ads about our services.
When this information is used for a purpose other than showing ads about our services or other services we have requested, it may constitute a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA.

Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information
Your Right
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we delete the Personal Information about you that we have collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records unless an exception applies. Many of the categories of Personal Information we collect are exempt from the CCPA, including the right to of a consumer to request the deletion of the Personal Information, because they are collected in the course of a natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, or contractor of Roth Staffing or emergency contact of such natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, or contractor of Roth Staffing.
A business is not required to comply with a request to delete if it is necessary for the business to maintain the Personal Information in order to, for example, complete a transaction; detect security incidents; protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity; exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right to free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law; comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act; comply with a legal obligation, or otherwise use the Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.
How to Submit a Request to Delete
If you have an account, you must log into your account and submit your request to delete through your account. If you do not have an account, you may submit a request to delete through our interactive webform available here or by calling us at 1-888-297-1911.
If you submit a request to delete online, you will be asked to confirm separately that you want your Personal Information deleted.
Our Process for Verifying a Request
If we determine that your request is subject to an exemption, we will notify you of our determination. If we determine that your request is not subject to an exemption, we will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request. Our verification process may differ depending on whether you maintain a password-protected account with us.
If you maintain a password-protected account, we may verify your identity through existing authentication practices available through your account. Prior to deleting the Personal Information, we will ask you to re-authenticate yourself with respect to that account.
If you do not maintain a password-protected account, or if you are an account-holder but we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity with your account, we will verify your identity either to a “reasonable degree of certainty” or a “reasonably high degree of certainty” depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the risk of harm to you by unauthorized deletion.
We will verify your identity to a “reasonable degree of certainty” by verifying at least two data points that you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities.
We will verify your identity to a “reasonably high degree of certainty” by verifying at least three pieces of Personal Information previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable the purpose of verifying identities.  In addition, you will be required to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the individual whose Personal Information is being requested.
Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
Your Right
If you are a California resident, you have the right to direct a business that sells (or may in the future sell) your Personal Information to stop selling your Personal Information and to refrain from doing so in the future.
The CCPA defines “sell” to mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a California resident’s Personal Information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.
Your privacy is our priority, and we do not monetize your Personal Information by selling it to third parties.
After you visit our Sites and/or use our Services, you may receive advertisements about Roth Staffing’s services when you visit other websites (i.e., social media sites, search engines or other websites that are unrelated to Roth Staffing). This happens because we use third-party vendors to provide you with information about our services based upon your interactions with our website.
These third-party vendors may work with additional providers in their relationship network that help provide the advertising services the third-party vendors provide to us.
Note, we use these third parties only to show you ads about Roth Staffing’s Services (i.e., we do not use third parties to advertise any other company’s products or services to you).
Our third-party vendors and, if applicable, providers in their relationship network, may use the information they collect for purposes that are unrelated to showing you ads about our services.
When this information is used for a purpose other than showing ads about our services or other services we have requested, it may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information under the CCPA.
Pursuant to the CCPA, in the preceding twelve (12) months, we have sold the following categories of Personal Information for the purpose of showing you ads about Roth Staffing’s Services:
Identifiers
Internet or other similar network activity
Geolocation data
In this limited context, we may sell your Personal Information to the following categories of third parties:

Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a California Resident’s Privacy Rights
We will not discriminate against California residents if they exercise any of the rights provided in the CCPA as described in this section “Notice to California Residents.” As such, we will not deny goods or services to that California resident; charge different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; provide a different level or quality of goods or services to the California resident; or suggest that the California resident will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. However, we are permitted to charge a California resident a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by the individual’s data.
Authorized Agents
California residents may use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or delete on your behalf.
If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or request to delete, we may require that (1) the authorized agent provide proof of your written permission and (2) you verify your identity directly with us. These requirements do not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
