Whistleblowers Policy
On 1 January 2020, Boardriders introduced a Whistleblowers Policy.
The policy applies to Australian Boardriders’ current and former:
(a)                officers
(b)                employees;
(c)                 suppliers of services or goods, and their employees (paid or unpaid); and
(d)                associates,
and their relatives, spouse and dependents (Eligible Whistleblower).
An Eligible Whistleblower qualifies for protection under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (‘Corporations Act’) if:
(a)                they have made a disclosure of information relating to a ‘disclosable matter’ directly to an ‘eligible recipient’ or to ASIC, APRA or another Commonwealth body prescribed by regulation; or
(b)                they have made a disclosure to a legal practitioner for the purposes of obtaining legal advice or legal representation about the operation of the whistleblower provisions in the Corporations Act.
For more information on what constitutes a disclosable matter or an eligible recipient or to obtain a copy of our whistleblowers policy, please contact whistleblower.apac@boardriders.com.
