Trial Presentation
A well told story looks simple…
Let us help you with your trial, so you can focus on your case. We will organize your material with smooth transitions, effective spotlights, and create a sophisticated and persuasive presentation.
Create the trial database and video/audio clips
Synchronize video depositions to scrolling transcript text
Create exhibit binders and print jury instructions
Provide a “hot seat operator” during the trial
Let your professionalism and ability as a trial attorney shine as we guide your jurors with side-by-side exhibit comparisons, highlighted text, pop-out annotations, witness video clips and more. If your needs are “extraordinary”, we also work with highly experienced technicians and hot seat pros for those “call in the cavalry” situations.
Please check out our Remote Services page for all your Zoom hosting needs.
