Dispute Resolution and Mandatory Arbitration
Informal Dispute Resolution
In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms, the parties agree to use their reasonable efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or disagreement directly through consultation ("Informal Dispute Resolution"), and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time Informal Dispute Resolution is initiated, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims subject to the terms set forth below.
Mandatory Arbitration
You and MNI hereby agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of relating to the Terms and the Sites will be settled in binding arbitration between you and MNI, and not in a court of law. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this obligation to arbitrate.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures available at adr.org ("Rules"). Arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator as selected pursuant to the Rules. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall be responsible for their own arbitration fees and costs.
Arbitration shall be initiated and take place in Cook County, Illinois. If the relief sought is less than $10,000 (USD), then either party may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted on the basis of documents provided to the arbitrator or through a telephonic hearing, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing.
Class Action Waiver
You and MNI agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute whether through a court of law or arbitration shall be solely conducted on an individual basis. You agree that you will not seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, representative action, collective action, or private attorney general action.
Survival
This section shall survive the termination of the Terms and your use of the Sites.
General Provisions
Feedback
Users may, from time to time, provide suggestions, comments, corrections, ideas, enhancement or feature requests, or other information (collectively "Feedback") to MNI with respect to the Sites. You grant to us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the Sites any Feedback provided by you relating to the operation of the Sites.
Assignment
Neither party may transfer or assign its rights or obligations under the Terms to any third party without the prior written approval of the other party, except for an assignment to an affiliated company or to a successor in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of substantially all of its assets or voting securities.
Notices
All notices under the Terms shall be in writing and be deemed to have been given upon: (a) personal delivery, (b) two (2) business days after mailing or deposing with a nationally recognized courier, or (c) immediately upon delivery by electronic mail (provided email shall not be sufficient for notices of an indemnifiable claim). Notices to MNI shall be addressed to:

Governing Law
The validity, construction, and performance of the Terms and the legal relations between you and MNI shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, excepting its choice of law rules if the application of such rules would result in the laws of another jurisdiction being applied. Notwithstanding you and MNI's agreement to mandatory arbitration, either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Cook County, Illinois, as necessary to protect the party's rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. You and MNI hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in Cook County, Illinois.
Force Majeure
MNI shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance to the extent caused by a condition, such as natural disaster, an act of war or terrorism, acts of God, civil unrest, labor condition, governmental action, Internet disturbance, or acts undertaken by third parties, including without limitation, a denial of service attack beyond MNI's reasonable control.
Severability
If any provision of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in effect.
Non-Waiver
No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the Terms will constitute a waiver of that right.
Entire Agreement
Except as expressly agreed to in writing by us, the Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Sites, and supersede all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties. In the event you execute any Agreements with us and there is any conflict or inconsistency with the Terms, the order of precedence shall be: (1) the Agreements, and (2) these Terms.
