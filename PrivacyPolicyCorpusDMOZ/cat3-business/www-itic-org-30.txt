Policy - Reuse & Recycling
Reuse & Recycling
Go Back
Another priority of the tech sector is to extend the lifetime of electronics through sophisticated repair and reuse activities while ensuring that obsolete products are managed in a responsible and sustainable manner. For newer products that still have years of remaining service, legal and practical reuse options exist and need to be preserved. For obsolete products, resource recovery from recycling is our preferred option, and must be done responsibly.
For example, ITI has engaged for years in Basel Convention efforts to ensure that reasonable controls exist that encourage legitimate reuse while preventing unscrupulous brokers from dumping e-waste on developing countries. ITI works with recyclers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to identify the best practices for sustainable recycling and incorporate those into standards, such as the Responsible Recycling (R2) Standard for Electronics Recyclers.
