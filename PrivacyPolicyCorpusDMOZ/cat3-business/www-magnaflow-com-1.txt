Your California Privacy Rights
The information set forth herein is provided to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
The California Consumer Privacy Act provides our customers who are California residents the right to notice and disclosure of the collection of their personal information and the right to request that such information be deleted, as more fully set forth, commencing with Civil Code section 1798.100.
Consumer requests related to our Privacy Policy and compliance with California law can be submitted as follows:

California Do Not Track Disclosures
California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. Magnaflow does not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created. For information about DNT, please visit: www.allaboutdnt.org.
