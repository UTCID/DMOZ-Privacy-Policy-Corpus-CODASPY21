Ribeye uses remarketing services to advertise on third party web sites to you after you visited our Service. We, and our third party vendors, use cookies to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Service.
Types of data we collect:
Google AnalyticsWhen someone visits this website, we use Google’s Analytics service to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site, what devices they are using and what country they are from. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. We not only abide by this Privacy Policy, but comply with all applicable laws, policies and regulations relating to the collection of information by visitors.
Google AdWordsWe use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on other websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who started but didn’t complete a purchase.Advertising to previous visitors could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.
You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using Google’s Ad Preferences page. If you really want to, you can opt out of targeted interest-based Google advertising entirely (although that does mean that you will see more ads for goods you aren’t interested in). You can read more on Google’s use of data collected via this link http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
