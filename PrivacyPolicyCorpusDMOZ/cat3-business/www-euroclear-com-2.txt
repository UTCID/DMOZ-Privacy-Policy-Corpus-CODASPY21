What is the legal basis for processing your personal data?
We will normally process personal data from you only where:
we need the personal data to carry out a contract with you;
we have obtained your consent to the processing of your personal data; or
the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not outweighed by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).
How long is personal data kept?
We will retain your personal data:
for as long as you keep your profile on my.euroclear.com; or
until you request us to remove your personal data from our marketing database (e.g. to honour opt-outs); or
as long as necessary to perform our contractual engagements with you
Personal data collected for conference advertisement or for conference registration is retained for the duration of the relevant event or longer if the event repeats (e.g. annually).
In addition, we may retain personal data from closed accounts to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any amounts owed, resolve disputes, assist with governmental investigation or take any actions permitted or required by applicable national laws.
Who might Euroclear share your personal data with?
We transfer your personal data within the Euroclear group for purposes consistent with this Privacy Notice. We take measures to restrict access to staff who have a legitimate business need to see your data.
Euroclear may also provide your personal data to public bodies such as regulatory, government agency, court or other third parties such as but not limited to, the Police Authorities, the Financial Supervisory Authorities and the Tax Agencies, where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your interests or those of any other person.
We also disclose your personal data to our third party vendors, service providers and partners who provide data processing services to us. This may be in connection with the services they provide to us, including to support us in areas such as IT platform management or support services, infrastructure and application services, marketing, data analytics. These service providers may change over time, but our commitment to using trusted vendors will not. We will always work with third parties who will handle your personal data in a way that aligns with this Notice and the GDPR. We have further inserted adequate contractual clauses with these third parties to ensure that your personal data remains protected. Further information can be provided upon request.
We also disclose your personal data with our auditors, advisors, legal representatives and similar agents in connection with the advisory services they provide to us for legitimate business purposes and under contractual prohibition of using the personal data for any other purpose.
International data transfers
Our group companies and third party contractors and consultants operate around the world. This means that we may process personal data outside the European Economic area (EEA). However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this notice. These include implementing data protection clauses and EU Standard Contractual Clauses with our third party vendors, contractors and consultants as well as with our group entities.

What about data security and quality?
We protect your personal data and maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes that are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data to help us to keep your personal data secure and to maintain its quality.

Secure operating environments - We store your data in secure operating environments and only accessible to Euroclear employees, agents and contractors on a need-to-know basis. Euroclear also follows generally accepted industry standards in this respect.

Prior authentication for account access - We require our website users registered on my.euroclear.com to verify their identity (e.g. login ID and password) before they can access or make changes to their account. This is aimed to prevent unauthorised accesses.
Links to non-Euroclear sites
The Euroclear website contains links to other websites. Euroclear is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other websites.
