Privacy Reminder
Protect your personal

Terms of Use
These are the Terms of
Use ("Terms") under which all job seekers, employers or other users
("You") may use the Monster Sites and the Services (each as defined
below). These Terms include the Monster Privacy
Policy, which is
incorporated into these Terms by reference.
These Terms constitute
a binding agreement between You and Monster Worldwide, Inc. or the Monster company
operating the Web site for the country in which You live or in which business
is headquartered (“Monster”), and are deemed accepted by You each time that You
use or access any Monster Site or Monster Services. If You do not accept the
Terms stated here, do not use the Monster Sites and the Monster Services.
The Monster Sites are
defined as any Web sites under Monster’s control, whether partial or otherwise
(including, without limitation, Monster.com, and the Web site from which these
terms of use were accessed from) and include the Monster Services. The Monster
Services are defined as the applications and services offered by Monster,
including an on-line service to post and search employment opportunities and
any mobile application or other interface that allows You to access such
application (collectively, “Monster Services”). The Monster Sites also allow users
(“Users”) to create individual profiles, which may include personal information
(“Profiles”), and to make these Profiles, or aspects thereof, public.  In
addition, Monster may collect information about You from publicly-available
websites and may use this information to create a Profile or append it to an
existing Profile.
Monster may revise
these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to this URL. You should
visit this URL periodically to review the most current Terms because they are
binding on You.
Users who violate
these Terms may have their access and use of the Monster Sites suspended or
terminated, at Monster’s discretion.
You must be 13 years
of age or older to visit or use any Monster Site in any manner, and, if under
the age of 18 or the age of majority as that is defined in Your jurisdiction,
must use any Monster Site under the supervision of a parent, legal guardian, or
other responsible adult.
You may not use the Monster Content (as defined below) or Profiles to
determine a consumer's eligibility for: (a) credit or insurance for personal,
family, or household purposes; (b) employment; or (c) a government license or
benefit.
1. Use of Monster Content.
Monster authorizes
You, subject to these Terms, to access and use the Monster Sites and the

or modify the Monster Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform,
distribute, or otherwise use the Monster Content in any way for any public or
commercial purpose, in connection with products or services that are not those
of the Monster Sites, in any other manner that is likely to cause confusion
among consumers, that disparages or discredits Monster or its licensors, that
dilutes the strength of Monster's or its licensor’s property, or that otherwise
infringes Monster's or its licensor’s intellectual property rights. You further
agree to in no other way misuse Monster Content. The use of the Monster Content
on any other application, web site or in a networked computer environment for
any purpose is prohibited. Any code that Monster creates to generate or display

intellectual property rights of others in any way. Monster reserves the right
to terminate the accounts of any Users, and block access to the Monster Sites
of any Users who are repeat infringers of the copyrights, or other intellectual
property rights, of others. Monster reserves the right, in its sole discretion,

8. Monster's Liability.
The Monster Sites act
as, among other things, venues for (i) employers to post job opportunities and
search for and evaluate job candidates and (ii) candidates to post resumes and
Profiles and search for and evaluate job opportunities. Monster does not screen
or censor the listings, including Profiles offered. Monster is not involved in,
and does not control, the actual transaction between employers and candidates.
As a result, Monster is not responsible for User Content, the quality, safety
or legality of the jobs or resumes posted, the truth or accuracy of the
listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or
the ability of candidates to fill job openings and Monster makes no
representations about any jobs, resumes or User Content on the Monster Sites.
While Monster reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content,
job ads, resumes or other material from the Monster Sites from time to time,
Monster does not assume any obligation to do so and to the extent permitted by
law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.
Monster Networking
provides a venue for individuals to network for professional and personal
purposes and Monster does not screen or censor the Profiles or User Content on
the Monster Sites. Monster is not involved in the actual communications between
Users. As a result, Monster has no control over the accuracy, reliability,
completeness, or timeliness of the Profiles or User Content submitted on the
Monster Sites and makes no representations about any Profile or User Content on
the Monster Sites.
Note that there are
risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with
strangers, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume
all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom You come in
contact through the Monster Sites. By its very nature other people’s
information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be
mislabeled or deceptively labeled. We expect that You will use caution and
common sense when using the Monster Sites.
Because User
authentication on the Internet is difficult, Monster cannot and does not
confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because we do not and cannot be
involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on
any Monster Site, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users,
You release Monster (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and
damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and
nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and
undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes to the
fullest extent permitted by law.
The Monster Sites and
the Monster Content may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors. Monster
makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or
timeliness of any Monster Site or the Monster Content. The use of all Monster
Sites and the Monster Content is at Your own risk. Changes are periodically
made to Monster Sites and may be made at any time. Monster cannot guarantee and
does not promise any specific results from use of any Monster Site. No advice
or information, whether oral or written, obtained by a User from Monster or
through or from any Monster Site shall create any warranty not expressly stated
herein.
If You are a
California resident, You waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says:
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor."
Monster encourages You
to keep a back-up copy of any of Your User Content. To the extent permitted by
law, in no event shall Monster be liable for the deletion, loss, or
unauthorized modification of any User Content.
