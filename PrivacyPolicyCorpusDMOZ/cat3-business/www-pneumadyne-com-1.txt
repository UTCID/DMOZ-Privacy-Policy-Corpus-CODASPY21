Regardless of location, we will, where necessary, put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure your information is adequately protected.Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, (see the full list) we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.Please contact us as set out in section 10 below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information (as required).4. How long do we keep your personal information?Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We will keep your information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which they were collected and any other permitted linked purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data.We restrict access to your personal information to those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s). When your information is no longer needed, it is either irreversibly anonymised (and the anonymised information may be retained) or securely destroyed.5.

Your rightsMarketingYou have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes.  We will inform you if we intend to use your information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by not checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal information.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us as set out in section 10 below. Updating informationWe will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your personal information is accurate.  In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us as set out in section 10 below.Your rights (this only applies if you are located in the EEA)If you have any questions in relation to our use of your personal information, you should first contact us as per section 10 section below.  Under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to: provide you with further details on the use we make of your information; provide you with a copy of information that you have provided to us; update any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold (please see above); delete any personal information the we no longer have a lawful ground to use; where processing is based on consent, to withdraw your consent so that we stop that particular processing (see above for marketing). Please note that if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide a particular service or content to you; to ask us to transmit the personal data you have provided to us and we still hold about you to a third party electronically; object to any processing based on the legitimate interests ground unless our reasons for undertaking that processing outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights; and restrict how we use your information whilst a complaint is being investigated.Your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g.  the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege). In addition, these will vary slightly between EEA states. For example, in France you also have the right to define directives as to how your personal data is to be used after your death. If you exercise any of these rights we will check your entitlement and respond in most cases within a month.If you are not satisfied with our use of your personal information or our response to any exercise of these rights you have the right to contact the data protection regulator in the EEA country in which you are based. Here is a list of the data protection regulators and their contact details. 9. Changes to this Privacy Policy and/or the Cookies PolicyWe may update this Privacy Policy and/or the Cookies Policy at any time. Where appropriate, any such changes will be notified to you and you are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy and the Cookies Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective only after the effective date of the change and will not affect any dispute arising prior to the effective date of the change.10. How to contact usDepending on where you are located, the “data controller” of your personal information processed by us under this privacy policy will be different.  Please see here for a list of which entities will be data controllers in which countries, and how to contact them if you have any queries about how we use your personal information, if you don't want us to send you marketing materials (including to opt-out of future marketing) and/or you wish to exercise any of your rights (set out in section 8).11.
