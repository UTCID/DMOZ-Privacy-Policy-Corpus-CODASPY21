Types of accident claims - am I eligible?
Types of injury and accident claims: am I eligible?Sometimes it can be reassuring to know other people have successfully made a claim for accidents similar to yours. You can also claim on behalf of someone else if, for example, they are under the age of 18 or lack the mental capacity to do so themselves.Below are some examples of the types of accident claims we have experience working with. Don't worry if your accident type is missing from our list - it's likely we can still help you. Road traffic accidentsYou might think of road traffic accidents as incidents involving two or more drivers.While they form a portion of accidents on the road, we're also able to help you claim for an accident and get compensation if you're a cyclist, pedestrian or even a passenger on public transport.Road accidents can be very shocking. We're here to help you make it right.Accidents in publicIt's easy to think a slip, trip or fall in a public place was your own fault. But the reality is that owners of businesses and public spaces have a responsibility to make sure you're safe.Slips, trips and falls can be caused by wet floors, uneven paving, cracked flooring, unexpected obstacles and more.It's not always clear who's fault your injury is. But we're here to help you and - as a leading accident specialist - we can help you understand who's responsible for your fall.Accident at workAccidents at work can be very stressful and can cause painful injuries. Regardless of your injury, you should be able to trust your employer to make sure you're safe in your working environment.Whether you work in an office, factory or construction site, your employer has a duty of care to keep you safe. If they've failed in their duty of care, then you've been put at risk.If you've been injured in an accident at work and it feels wrong, we can help you make it right. Get in touch with us for free, impartial advice via our accident advice helpline: .Personal injury typesThe types of injury suffered depend on the circumstances and severity of the accident. Working around chemicals can cause burn injuries. Working in a noisy environment without the right protection can result in hearing loss. Road traffic accidents can cause a range of injuries, from minor cuts and wounds to fractures, breaks and those that are life-changing. However you've been hurt, if it was down to someone else's negligence then we may be able to help you.Areas of injuryNo part of the body is safe in an accident. However, things like head, brain, neck and spine injuries are to be expected in road traffic accidents, motorcycle accident claims and some work-related or falling incidents. Learn more about claiming for an accident of this type in our area of injury section.

It means there's no financial risk to you when making a claim.

Frequently asked questions...
How long after an accident can I claim?
In most circumstances for adults who were 18 years old or over at the time, it's essential that you (or your legal representation) issue proceedings within three years of the accident or incident. Where the injured person was under 18 years old when it occurred, that three-year limitation period expires on their 21st birthday. If you don't issue your claim within these time limits, you won't usually be able to proceed. This is called being ‘time-barred'. There are some certain situations where the time limits can be extended. Check with one of our advisors or a solicitor.
Will my accident compensation claim go to court?
The figures show it's pretty unlikely. The vast majority of personal injury compensation claims are settled without a Hearing in front of a Judge. In most cases, your legal representatives negotiate with the other side (usually their insurance company) to reach a satisfactory compensation award and that's that. Where the other side accepts liability from the start, the process is quick - perhaps a couple of months. This can be known as non-fault accident compensation. If the other side denies or disputes liability (for instance where the blame is shared), a negotiated settlement is still possible. On rare occasions where negotiations fail without agreement, then a Court Hearing is needed.
What's the best way to claim for an accident?
By talking to an expert accident claim company at the earliest available moment. We can give you all the initial free advice you need to help you make the right decision. If you want to go ahead with the claim, we'll then put you in touch with an experienced and trusted firm in our nationwide network of approved legal practices. Provided they can take on your claim under no win no fee arrangements - as is the case in all but the most exceptional circumstances - there are no up-front costs.  Your solicitor may need to take out special legal protection insurance for you, which pays the costs if your claim fails, and ensures claiming is risk free. The cost of this is only taken if you win your case. You’ll never have to pay anything upfront and there are no hidden charges, so you’ll never be out of pocket.If your accident claim is successful you’ll be asked to pay any costs and expenses, not paid for by the other side, from your compensation. This is likely to happen in most cases, as the other side is only required to make a contribution to your legal fees.
What is no win no fee?
What makes an accident claim successful?Each individual case is different, which means there's no hard or fast rule as to what makes an accident claim successful. The best way to find out is to get in touch with our free accident claims helpline on .Beryl Shave, 70, tripped over an unmarked, broken post in a supermarket car park
I grazed my hand, hit my leg below the knee and bashed my shoulder. My daughter suggested I make a no win no fee claim. It was all very easy
Julie Maddocks suffered severe burns on her hands
I was unable to use my hands, couldn’t put my jeans on, couldn’t cook and became nervous of open flames.
A friend told me about National Accident Helpline and the service was really good. I was put in touch with a solicitor and saw a burns specialist.
Charlotte's partner claimed after she injured her arm and leg
It was no hassle from my point of view. I wasn’t expected to go very far for appointments, all the specialists were local, which is important being disabled. It couldn’t have been handled better.
Russell Wincott, 26, received £6,400 after a road accident
National Accident Helpline were the only ones who could point me in the right direction
Russell Wincott dislocated his wrist and suffered a complicated fracture following an accident
There was an 80% chance I would never use my wrist again, the consultant was worried. It was scary.
The compensation made things easier. I paid for the physio out of the claim, which the solicitors organised for me. It also paid for the six weeks I was off work.
