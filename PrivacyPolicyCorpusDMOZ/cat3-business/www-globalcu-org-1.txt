Information Accuracy—No Warranties
All information is either generated by us or is obtained from sources believed by us to be accurate and reliable as of the date posted on the Site.

Computer Virus Information
It is possible to contract a computer virus or other malicious code by using the Internet or materials downloaded from it. We cannot assure you that the Site and any software or other information downloaded from it will be virus or problem free and disclaim any liability (if any) for viruses and similar problems. We attempt to keep our site virus free, but cannot assure you that our efforts will always be successful.
Consequential Damages
To the full extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that neither we nor any of our affiliates will be liable to you and/or any third party for any consequential or incidental damages (including but not limited to lost profits or lost opportunity), or any other indirect, special, or punitive damages whatsoever, that arise out of or are related to the Site, or any use of it or information in it, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion of damages includes damages claimed in any cause of action, including but not limited to legal or equitable proceedings and claims relating to contract, tort or products liability.
Damages Limitations and Exclusive Remedies
You agree that your recovery for any allowable damages will be limited to those that you incur in actual reliance and shall be limited, at our election, to: (1) a refund of any amount (if any) you paid to us or (2) correction or replacement of any information. Any failure or unconscionability of any remedy does not affect the enforceability of the limitations on and exclusions of consequential, incidental and other damages, and you expressly agree that those limitations and exclusions are independent of the performance of any or all agreed remedies. All limitations will apply to all legal and equitable theories, including but not limited to contract, tort or products liability.
Changes and Availability
We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions from time to time, however, so you agree to check the Terms and Conditions periodically to make sure you remain comfortable with it. Each time you visit our Site, you agree to check for changes to the Terms and Conditions. No changes proposed by you or us will be effective unless and until they appear in these Terms and Conditions. If you do not want to be bound by any changes, you must not use the Site after the effective date.
We also reserve the right to terminate the Site or your license, make access unavailable, and change the Site content, with or without reason or notice at any time. Accordingly, if you would like a copy of something that you are authorized to copy, you should copy it when you see it.
Miscellaneous Provisions
The laws of the State of Washington govern this agreement. You consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Spokane County, WA, in all disputes arising out of or relating to the Site, any use of it or any information in it. You agree that a printed or electronic version of these Terms and Conditions (as changed from time to time) will be admissible in any judicial or administrative proceedings to the same extent as paper records. If you ever believe we have not adhered to this contract or are liable for any other reason, please contact us immediately. If you feel compelled to bring a lawsuit or other proceeding, you must do so within one (1) year of the date you have a right to sue. Any clause of these Terms and Conditions declared invalid shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder.
You also agree that the prevailing party in any lawsuit shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. Contact us if you have questions or problems with this Site.
