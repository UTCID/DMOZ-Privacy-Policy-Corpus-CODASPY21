Non-personally identifiable information: In general, you can visit the Site without being asked to reveal any Personally Identifiable Information. However, our web servers may collect some information that does not identify you personally. For instance, we may collect and log the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a visitor’s computer (which is the address of your computer on the Internet), the browser a visitor is using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the operating system (e.g., Windows) and the domain names that you have visited before entering and after leaving the Site. This information is aggregated to measure statistics about our visitors, such as the number of visits to the Site, the average time spent on the Site and the pages viewed on the Site. We use this information to monitor the use of the Site and to improve the Site’s content. Except in connection with certain permitted disclosures to law enforcement (discussed below) and certain technical features of the Site (e.g., maintaining session status), such information is only used in the aggregate.
Children’s Privacy

You are responsible for exiting or logging-off each time you finish using the Service.
