Please remember that even if you opt out of receiving marketing e-mails, we may still send you important Service information related to your accounts and subscriptions.
How We Share Personal Data
It is the policy of Minitab and our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates to protect Personal Data both online and off-line.

outsourced service providers who perform functions on our behalf, located inside or outside of the European Union (in such case, we will use appropriate legal framework to operate data transfers).

comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal processes, including from law enforcement or other government agencies, upon valid and enforceable request thereof; or
operate and maintain the security of our Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
Please note that some of our Services may direct you to services of third parties whose privacy practices differ from Minitab’s. If you provide Personal Data to any of those services, your data is governed by their privacy statements or policies. Minitab, LLC and our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. Please review the privacy policies for these web sites to understand how they process your information.

We may use and transfer to any other app information received from Google APIs and will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

If your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the legal or business purposes for which it is processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that information.
Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data
Minitab respects your right to access and control your Personal Data. You have choices about the data we collect.
