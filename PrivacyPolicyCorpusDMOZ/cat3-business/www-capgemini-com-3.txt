What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded onto your device when you access a website.
What do cookies do?
It allows the website to recognise your device and store some information about your preferences or past actions in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. In short, cookies help us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website.
Are all cookies the same?
Not exactly.
Cookies may differ depending on their duration or on their origin.
1. There are 2 types of duration for cookies:
Session cookies which are temporary and will only be stored in the memory of your browser while it is open. As soon as the browser is closed, the cookie will be removed from your its history.
Persistent cookies which have an expiration date stuck to them. These cookies are not removed when the browser is closed but are removed after the expiry date is reached. These durations are set in accordance with the purpose served by the cookies. You can also manually delete these cookies.
2. Cookies can originate from different sources:
First-party cookies are created by the website you are visiting.
Third-party cookies are created by third-party vendors and placed by the website owner for different purposes.
You can find more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, at www.aboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu.
Web beacons
Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) are typically transparent graphic images placed on a website. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to consider the actions of our website’s visitors. We may use beacons to obtain information such as the IP address of the machine that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears or the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page was consulted, and the version of browser used to visit the page.
IP addresses and URLs
An IP address is a unique identifier that certain devices use to identify and communicate over the Internet. When you visit our website, we may view the IP address of the device used to connect to the internet via the aforementioned web beacons. This information is used to determine the general physical location of the device. We may use this information to change the way we present our sites to enhance your visit.
A URL (uniform resource locator) is a unique identifier or address for each resource on the internet. For instance, it is the address for the web page that you are visiting. We will use this information to see which pages are visited and the way that you navigate through our website.
