Research
We may contract with a market-research firm to conduct occasional online surveys. When you’re within our sites, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. If you do not wish to participate, simply click the “No, Thank You” link and you will not see this window again. If you choose to participate, you’ll be prompted to answer a series of online questions. You will be prompted to enter your e-mail address for validation purposes but no other personal information (name, address, etc.) will be collected as part of the survey. In some cases, however, you may be offered a free gift for your participation. We will need your name and address, which will be used exclusively to fulfill your gift request.
Cookie Technology

This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of checking our registration database each time a page is requested. The cookie is deleted when a user chooses the log out feature to terminate their session. We also employ cookie technology to store subscribers’ User Names and Passwords.
