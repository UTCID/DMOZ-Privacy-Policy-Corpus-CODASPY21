Disputes, Time To Bring Claim, Waiver of Jury Trial, Arbitration, Choice of Law, and Jurisdiction
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN AN ACTION IN COURT, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ("AAA") RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR DUNHAM'S WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
Time Within Which to Address Any Concern, Cause of Action Or Claim
Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, Dunham's Programs and/or the Sites must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action arose, otherwise such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.
Waiver of Jury Trial
DUNHAM'S AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT EITHER MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, DUNHAM'S PROGRAMS AND/OR THE SITES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, FEDERAL, STATE, OR MUNICIPAL STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. DUNHAM'S AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE EACH GIVNG UP THE RIGHT TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN COURT AND TO HAVE THOSE CLAIMS DECIDED BY A JURY.
Binding Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action
By using any of the Sites you unconditionally agree that all claims relating to your access or use of Dunham's Programs and/or Our Sites, including all disputes arising out of, or related to, any products or services purchased from Dunham's at, through or in reliance on any Site, whether based on contract, tort, federal, state, or municipal statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved entirely through binding individual arbitration, rather than in court. Dunham's and you each agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, consolidated, representative or collective action basis. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, Dunham's and you each waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action against the other. Dunham's and you also both agree that each may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Rules, and the general grant of authority to the arbitrator of the power to determine issues of arbitrability, the arbitrator shall have no jurisdiction or authority to compel any class or collective claim, consolidate different arbitration proceedings, or join any other party to an arbitration between Dunham's and you. You may also assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims otherwise qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration laws apply.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Dunham's Athleisure Corporation, 5607 New King Drive, Troy, Michigan 48098, Attention: Legal Department. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the AAA Rules are inconsistent with these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use shall govern. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the enforceability of these Terms of Use and arbitrability of disputes. Both Dunham's and you recognize that they are waiving their right to adjudicate any claims in court. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's Rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You will be responsible for your own attorney fees and expenses unless the arbitration rules or applicable law permit you to recover your attorney's fees. Likewise, Dunham's will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless the claims are frivolous. If We are the claiming party initiating an arbitration against you, We will pay all costs associated with the arbitration (other than your attorneys' fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law).
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. However, the arbitrator shall have discretionary authority to require a face-to-face meeting, if it determines that such face to face meeting is necessary for a fundamentally fair hearing.
30-Day Right to Opt-Out
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address via certified mail: Dunham's Athleisure Corporation, 5607 New King Drive, Troy, Michigan 48098, Attention: Legal Department. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of a Site, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those Sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Dunham's also will not be bound by them.
Applicable Law
The law applicable to the interpretation and construction of these Terms of Use and any transaction (including purchases made on or at a Site) using or related to a Site, shall be the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws and the laws of the State of Michigan, USA, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, but subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and other federal law relating to the arbitrability of claims. You agree that all matters relating to these Terms of Use and/or access to or use of the Sites, including all disputes, (whether in contract, tort, or statute) will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, USA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes related to or arising under or out of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. §227 et. seq., shall be governed by federal law as interpreted by the federal district courts in the State of Pennsylvania and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Severability
In the event that any provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be deemed modified, if possible, to the extent required to render it valid, enforceable and binding, and such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms of Use.
Binding Agreement
These Terms of Use shall be binding upon both parties and their respective parent, subsidiary, affiliated or related companies, or their past or present officers, directors, members, managers, shareholders, agents, employees, successors, estate or assigns.
Non-Waiver
Failure by either party at any time to enforce any of the terms hereof or a breach by the other party shall not constitute a waiver of any of the provisions hereof or of subsequent breaches.
Entire Agreement/Merger and Integration
These Terms of Use and Our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire and final expression of the agreement between the parties pertaining to the use of the Sites and related subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior related communications or agreements, whether oral, written, or electronically transmitted, between the parties.
