Privacy Policy
We will not sell or disseminate any information you provide us to any third party. Period.
When you place an order or register your Top Tag product, we will ask for your address, credit card number and so on. The information is required for warranty protection and to process a transaction. This is proprietary information and will not be divulged to anyone.
Also, it is important for you to know that we only record IP addresses (where your computer is located on the internet) in aggregate form. This means we are using the clustered addresses to learn about general patterns — whether you came to our site from Google, Yahoo, MSN and so on. We also learn how easy it was for you to navigate through our site and if you found what you were looking for. Such information helps us serve all our customers better. Lastly, your IP address is never associated or linked to ANY personal information.
We value your privacy as much as we value our own and so we take the responsibility of protecting our customers’ personal information seriously.
Secure Online Ordering.
Tansactions processed through our secure Paypal shopping cart are safeguarded by the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Your card number and your billing and shipping address is encrypted and scrambled as it travels over the internet and processed through Authorize.net.
