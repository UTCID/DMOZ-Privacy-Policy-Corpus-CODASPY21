By enrolling in the Auto-renew Program, the Primary and Complimentary Member authorizes Sam's Club to charge the scheduled payments (or any adjustment thereof) to any card on file or any payment method in the digital wallet, and represents that they are the owner or authorized user of the account(s) and payment methods to be charged.

By enrolling in the Auto-renew Program, a Member agrees to receive communication about Membership renewals only by email and to receive marketing and promotional email from Sam's Club.

Sam's Club will notify the Member by email, at least 10 days prior to making any charge, if there is a change to the fee. Although payment will usually be processed on the scheduled date, the Member should allow several days for processing. ALL AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER THE AUTO-RENEW PROGRAM REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION IS CANCELLED. Members may cancel enrollment in the Auto-renew Program at any time online through the Site, in Clubs, or by calling 1-888-746-7726. Cancellation of enrollment in the Auto-renew Program is distinct from cancellation of your Sam's Club Membership. A Member can keep his/her Membership active after unenrolling in the Auto-renew Program by paying the renewal fee in Clubs, online or by calling 1-888-746-7726. Continued participation in the Auto-renew Program after any changes to these Terms or changes to the Membership fee constitutes acceptance of the changes.

Cash Rewards Program Terms & Conditions I. Introduction The Sam's Club Cash Rewards program (the "Cash Rewards Program") is a membership benefit exclusively for U.S. Sam's Club Plus Members. The Cash Rewards Program allows Sam's Club Plus Members to earn Cash Rewards at Sam's Club locations on qualifying purchases, as set forth below and subject to change at Sam's Club discretion. Earned Cash Rewards are loaded on to the membership account at the end of each membership year (12-month period) and are then available for redemption as cash or store credit at Sam's Club locations. Participation in the Cash Rewards Program is subject to these Terms and Conditions, the Sam's Club Membership Terms and Conditions and other Sam's Club rules and policies that may be applicable. Participation in Cash Rewards constitutes acceptance of these Cash Rewards Terms and Conditions. All Sam's Club rules, including these Cash Rewards Terms and Conditions, may be amended from time to time without notice. II. Earning Cash Rewards
Sam's Club Plus Members earn 2% in Cash Rewards on qualifying pre-tax purchases minus any redeemed savings or other discounts during a membership year with a maximum reward of $500 per membership per12-month period. Cash Rewards are loaded onto the Sam's Club Plus Member account about two months before the end of the membership year. Returns for refund of qualified purchases are deducted from accrual of Cash Rewards. Only qualifying purchases made by the Primary Member or Complimentary Household Cardholder, in a Sam's Club facility located in the United States (excluding Puerto Rico) qualify for Cash Rewards. Sam's Club Add-On Members do not qualify to earn Cash Rewards for themselves or for their Primary Member. Sam's Club reserves the right to modify qualifying purchases as determined at Sam's Club discretion. Limit one Plus Membership per household or business. Sam's Club reserves the right to correct any errors it discovers resulting in changes to the Cash Rewards Program or to a Member's Cash Rewards balance.

Pickup Terms & Conditions I. Introduction In a continuing effort to provide legendary member service and experience, Sam's Club offers Pickup services ("Pickup") for certain Members shopping on SamsClub.com. Participation is subject to these "Pickup Terms and Conditions." By participating in Pickup, you acknowledge that you have read these Pickup Terms and Conditions, understand them, and agree to be bound by them. Participation in Pickup is subject to these Pickup Terms and Conditions, the Membership Terms and Conditions, the Website Terms and Conditions, and other Sam's Club rules and policies as may be applicable. All Sam's Club rules, including these Pickup Terms and Conditions, may be amended from time to time without notice. II. Pickup
Pickup is a free service for certain Sam's Club Members that lets you order online at SamsClub.com and pick up your goods at any Sam's Club in the US or Puerto Rico. Simply place your order online at SamsClub.com, select a day and time that fits your schedule, and then pick up your items from the designated Sam's Club. Sam's Club reserves the right to limit the availability of Pickup and reserves the right to charge a restocking fee for orders not picked up on time or not picked up. We aim to have your goods ready at the pickup time you selected when placing your order, but we do not guarantee that the goods will be ready on or by a certain date and time. Sam's Club will not be liable for not having the goods ready outside of the requested pickup slot or for failing to provide all or any of the goods in your order. Not all items are eligible for Pickup. Eligible items will be noted online with the option "Pick up in Club."
Merchandise is subject to availability and is limited by the Sam's Club Merchandise Policy. If the item you requested is not available you will not be charged for that item. Select items require proof of age. III. Pricing and Weighted Items
All prices on SamsClub.com are shown in US dollars. Prices, unit prices (for weighted items), and available quantities may vary by Club and date. Pickup: Price or unit price will be determined at the time you provide payment information.
If you choose to pay for a Pickup order in-Club at the time of pickup, the price or unit price (for weighted items) charged for each item will be based on the price at the time of pickup, and that price or unit price may be different from the online price at the time of order placement. If you pay in advance on SamsClub.com at the time of order placement, then the price or unit price of each item is determined by the online price at the time you place your order. In either case, the final price of fresh weighted items will be based on the applicable unit price and the quantity actually purchased.
Weighted Items: For certain items, including fresh meat, home meal solutions, and some bakery and cheese products, your final price is based on the unit price at the time you provide payment information and the actual weight of the item you purchase. At the time of online order placement, you will select the desired quantity of an item and be shown a maximum price that will be charged for the item. In no event will the final price of the weighted item exceed the maximum price that was authorized at the time of order placement. See the Instant Savings Terms and Conditions for details about the applicability of Instant Savings to Pickup orders.
IV. Payment Members can pay using any form of payment currently accepted for online purchases under the Membership Terms and Conditions. V. Authorization Process When you place an order, Sam's Club authorizes your credit or debit card to make sure sufficient funds are available. Also note that all credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks by third parties and authorization by the card issuer. If the issuer of the card refuses to authorize payment or any other validation checks return adverse results, we will not accept your order. We will not be liable for non-processing of your order. Please contact your card issuer or your bank for the reason of refusal. VI. Taxes We are required by law to collect all taxes based on where your order is being processed. When you review your order total during the checkout process, you'll see the estimated sales tax. Actual taxes will be charged based on your delivery or pick up destination or the address from where the order is sourced, depending upon state and local laws. Taxes may be applied to pre-discounted prices depending on state and local laws. VII. Order Cancellation For Pickup, orders that are not picked up within the Club two days after the selected pickup date will automatically be cancelled and items returned to inventory. If the Pickup order was prepaid, you will not be charged if the order is cancelled. However, Sam's Club reserves the right to charge a restocking fee for cancelled orders. VIII. Miscellaneous Terms Sam's Club reserves the right to amend, cancel or temporarily suspend these Pickup and Delivery Services, in whole or in part, or change any of these Pickup Terms and Conditions at any time for any or no reason.

Accepted Payment Methods Payment for a third-party service subscription may be made in any form authorized under the Membership Terms and Conditions for online purchases, except that Sam's Club Credit Direct Accounts and digital wallet service-Visa Checkout will not be accepted for third-party service subscriptions. A Walmart or Sam's Club gift/e-gift card may be used for the initial interval of a third-party service subscription (i.e., the first month or year); however, such payment method may not be used for subsequent intervals of the service subscription. Irrespective of the payment method used for initial purchase, a valid preferred card is needed on file to complete checkout of a third-party service subscription. IV. Third-Party Service Subscription Billing The price, plus any applicable taxes, for a third-party service subscription is disclosed to you when you place your order. You will be charged when you place your order, regardless of when you activate or start the service subscription with the third party. You will then be automatically charged on a recurring basis at the interval you have selected (e.g., monthly) unless and until you change or cancel your third-party service subscription. Note that the service subscription price may change at any time, and the price will change if your Sam's Club membership tier changes. See the table in Section V, below, for details. You agree to waive the right to receive notice of all variations in price, and instead agree to receive such notice only if the price for the third-party service subscription increases by more than twenty dollars ($20.00). In such a case, and if the payment method you selected, or that Sam's Club will charge, is a debit or prepaid card, Sam's Club will provide you with notice at least ten (10) days in advance of the next recurring charge at the higher price, and you will have the option to cancel your subscription. The notice will be sent to the email associated with your SamsClub.com account. The price, plus any applicable taxes, for each interval (e.g., each month) will be billed to the payment method selected by you on the subscriptions page of your SamsClub.com account, subject to Section III (Accepted Payment Methods) above. If we are unable to complete payment for your third-party service subscription with the payment method you selected to purchase your third-party service subscription (for example, because that payment method has expired or is otherwise unavailable), you agree that we may charge any other payment method stored in your SamsClub.com account until you select a new designated payment method. If no payment methods in your account can be used, your service subscription will be canceled by Sam's Club unless or until you update your payment method information in your SamsClub.com account. Please remember to update your payment method information as necessary to avoid delays or cancelations. Your third-party service subscription will otherwise remain in effect until it is canceled by you or Sam's Club. A free-trial period may be offered to first-time subscribers of certain third-party service subscription plans. There is a limit of one (1) free trial period per member across all eligible third-party service subscription plans on each third-party service subscription description page on SamsClub.com. Any free-trial period for a third-party service subscription will begin on the date of purchase on SamsClub.com. You will be automatically charged for the third-party service subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless you cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the free-trial ends. See Section V, below, for instructions on how to cancel. If you upgrade your third-party service subscription during the free trial period, you will lose your free trial, and Sam's Club will charge you immediately for the upgraded third-party service subscription plan. V. Changing and Canceling Third-Party Service Subscriptions If you choose to purchase a third-party service subscription, you will continue to receive the subscription until you change or cancel the subscription or your Sam's Club membership. You can change or cancel your third-party service subscription on the subscriptions page in your SamsClub.com account. From there, you can also modify or update your payment method. You must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of your current interval in order to avoid being charged for the next interval of your third-party service subscription. For example, if your subscription is monthly, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the current monthly billing interval in order to avoid a charge for the next monthly interval, and if your subscription is annual, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the current annual billing interval in order to avoid a charge for the next annual interval.

Scan and Go Terms & Conditions I. Introduction The Sam's Club Scan & Go App ("SNG App") is designed to allow users to use their smartphones to scan items for purchase in participating Sam's Clubs and skip long checkout lines. Use of the SNG App is subject to these SNG App Terms and Conditions. By using the SNG App, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted the Terms and Conditions and consent to be bound by them. In addition to these Terms, use of the SNG App is subject to the Terms and Conditions of SamsClub.com, which are available here. All information provided by users of the SNG App will be controlled by the Sam's Club Privacy Policy, which is available here and incorporated by reference. Additional relevant terms, including but not limited to Membership Terms and Conditions, Instant Savings Terms and Conditions, Cash Rewards Terms and Conditions, also apply and are available here. All Sam's Club rules, including these SNG App Terms and Conditions, may be amended from time to time without notice. In addition, Sam's Club may alter, suspend, or terminate use of the SNG App at any time at its discretion without notice to the user. II. Accessing and Using the SNG App
The SNG App is designed to allow Members to use their smartphones to scan items for purchase in participating Sam's Clubs and skip long checkout lines. To use the SNG App, open the app and scan each item's barcode, or if there is no barcode, the app will use computer vision and AI technology to recognize the products scanned. If the app is unable to automatically determine the item, please look up the item in the SNG App. Please note that images of scanned items may be retained by Sam's Club to improve our software. When shopping is complete, check out and pay for purchases in the SNG App with an accepted form of payment, and show the receipt from your phone on the way out. For certain large SNG App purchases, you will be asked to confirm your payment method and identity with a Sam's Club associate located at the Club exit by presenting the credit card used for the transaction and a government-issued photo identification. If you are unable or unwilling to do so, you must pay for your purchase using traditional check-out methods. Please consult your Club for further details. Some items such as alcohol, tobacco, non pre-activated gift cards, tires, car batteries, hearing center items, R-rated movies and games, prescriptions and some harsh chemicals cannot be purchased using the SNG App. Sam's Club reserves the right to prohibit any individual from using the SNG App for any reason, including for: (1) violating any of these Terms and Conditions, (2) acting in a manner inconsistent with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances or these Terms and Conditions, (3) engaging in any misconduct or wrongdoing in connection with the SNG App, or (4) engaging in any fraudulent or inappropriate acts through the SNG App. The SNG App is designed to be used on the user's personal smartphone with internet access. Sam's Club is not responsible for any data usage charges, service plans, fees, taxes or other charges related to your smartphone you may incur in connection with using the SNG App. Sam's Club is not responsible for: (a) any inability to use the SNG App; (b) any delay in receiving information from the SNG App; (c) any acts or omissions of third parties; or (d) any errors in relation to the messages provided by the SNG App, including, without limitation, any pricing or typographical errors, errors of description, or errors regarding advertised prices.
