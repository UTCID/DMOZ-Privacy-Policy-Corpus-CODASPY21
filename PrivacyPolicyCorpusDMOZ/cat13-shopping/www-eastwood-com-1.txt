Request to Know and Request to Delete
Subject to certain exceptions set forth under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, you have a right to request that we disclose to you (and, if requested, to receive a portable copy of) the Personal Information about you that we collect, use, disclose and sell to third parties (a “Request to Know”), and you have a right to request that we delete your personal information that we have collected or that we maintain (a “Request to Delete”).
You may submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete by contacting us at our toll free telephone number 800.345.1178, by visiting us on the web at www.eastwood.com and completing and submitting the interactive webform here, or by logging in to your password-protected account on the Website and accessing the self-service portal we have provided for you there.
You can access the self-service portal by clicking here.
Upon receipt of your Request to Know or Request to Delete, we will take steps to verify your identity in order to confirm that the person making the request is actually the person about whom we have collected Personal Information (that the “you” making the request is actually you):
• If you have a password-protected account on our Website, we verify such requests by asking users to log in to their existing password-protected accounts on the Website and re-authenticate themselves by re-entering their user name and password.
In this situation, even if you choose to submit your Request to Know or Request to Delete using the telephone number or webform described above, we will respond (for verification purposes) by providing detailed instructions directing you to log in to your existing password-protected account on the Website and re-authenticate yourself by re-entering your user name and password.
Once you have verified your identity, you may use the self-service portal we have provided for you there to submit your Request to Know or Request to Delete.
• If you do not have a password-protected account on our Website, please note that we have only limited information about you.
If your only contact with us has been to sign up for our e-mail newsletter via the Website, we verify such requests by asking users to send the Request to Know or Request to Delete to help@eastwood.com using the e-mail address you believe we have on file for you.
In all other cases, you will be required to verify your request by verifying certain Personal Information we have on file for you, and it is possible we may be unable to reasonably verify your request.
You may also designate an authorized agent to make a Request to Know or Request to Delete on your behalf.
To designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf in this manner, you or your authorized agent must submit verifiable proof (acceptable to us, acting in our reasonable discretion) that either (1) such agent has actually been authorized in writing to act on your behalf, or (2) you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
You may submit such proof by e-mailing us at help@eastwood.com.
If a duly-designated authorized agent makes a Request to Know or Request to Delete on your behalf, we will still require you to verify your own identity using the process described above, unless you have submitted verifiable proof to us that you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney (in which case your submission to us of verifiable proof that you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney, as described above, will serve as the required verification of your identity for purposes of processing the Request to Know or Request to Delete).
If you choose to exercise any of these rights, you will not receive differential treatment by us as a result (e.g., different prices or quality of services), except to the extent permitted by applicable law (including if those differences are reasonably related to the value of your Personal Information).
