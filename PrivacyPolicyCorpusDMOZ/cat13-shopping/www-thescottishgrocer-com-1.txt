Privacy Policy
1. Protecting your information
The Personal Customer Information you provide — including your credit card information — to establish an account with us and to make purchases from us is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites.
2. Password security
To further secure your Personal Customer Information, we require you to create a customer password when you establish an account with us. We encourage you to use a password that is not easily guessed (i.e., don’t use your name or street name). Keep your password secret; do not share it with anyone. The only way you can place an order with us online is by entering both your registered email address and password. If you forget your password, you can contact us and we’ll send you a new randomly generated password. It will be sent to the email address under which your thescottishgrocer.com Account is assigned. If you want to change your password or other account information, simply click on My Account and go to “Change My Password” and follow the instructions for changing passwords.
3. Safe Shopping Guarantee
Under federal law, a credit card issuer cannot make you liable for charges in excess of $50.00 that result from the unauthorized use of your credit card. There are similar federal laws that relate to debit cards. Exceptions do apply, and you will have to comply with the rules of your credit card or debit card issuer, so please contact your card issuer for further details. If a credit card or debit card issuer assesses you a fee because of the unauthorized use of your credit card or debit card on our site, thescottishgrocer.com will reimburse you for such amount up to $50.00. Please contact our Customer Service for details.
4. Privacy
We will not rent or sell your name, address, email address, credit card information or personal information to any third party without your permission. However, we must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.
If you have particpated in a discussion group, purchased from our store or subscribed to our newsletter, we may occasionally update you via email of special opportunities. We may also contact you if you have entered one of our contests or sweepstakes. If you choose not to receive updates when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, it will not affect your chances of winning.
To customize the information you wish to receive from us, or to let us know you do not wish to receive email from us, simply Contact Us using this form. We may share non-personal, non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with our advertisers or other third-parties for research purposes. In other words, we will not tell our partners that you purchased a specific product, but we may tell them how many customers purchased that product.
If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, please Contact Us by email or call 877-359-8369
