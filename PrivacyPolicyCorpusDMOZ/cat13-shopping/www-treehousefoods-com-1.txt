Some internet browsers, websites (such as Facebook), and mobile devices offer opt-outs for interest-based advertising. Please refer to the website that you are visiting, your browser and/or your device settings for additional information.

Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your Personal Information.
Your Privacy Rights In California
This California Privacy Notice (“California Notice”) applies to California residents whose Personal Information is processed by TreeHouse pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) or other California privacy laws described below. The California Notice describes how we protect the Personal Information we process and control relating to California residents and rights California residents may have in relation to this Personal Information. For purposes of this California Notice, “Personal Information” has the meaning provided by the CCPA and does not include information that is publicly available, that is deidentified or aggregated such that it is not capable of being associated with you, or that is excluded from the CCPA’s scope.
Your California Rights and Choices: As a California resident, you may be able to request to exercise the following rights:
The Right to Know any or all of the following information relating to your Personal Information we have collected and disclosed in the last 12 months, upon verification of your identity:
The specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you;
The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you;
The categories of sources of the Personal Information;
The categories of Personal Information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose, and the categories of recipients to whom this information was disclosed;
The categories of Personal Information we have sold and the categories of third parties to whom the information was sold; and
The business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling the Personal Information.
The Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information we have collected from you.
However, this right is limited by a number of exceptions. Fundamentally, if TreeHouse has a permissible need to retain Personal Information, we are not under an obligation to delete such information, even when requested. Generally, we retain Personal Information so we may complete the transaction for which the Personal Information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between us and you; detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity; debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality of our online properties; enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with TreeHouse; comply with a legal obligation; or otherwise use your Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information. As such, we generally do not accept requests to delete Personal Information.
The Right to Opt Out of Personal Information Sales to third parties now or in the future.
What We Do: While we collect, process, and share your information for purposes described in this policy, which include “business purposes” under the CCPA; we do not currently “sell” Personal Information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about the users of our Website for the purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting. This activity can be considered a “sale” under California law.
You have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Information. Such requests may be submitted by following the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link at the bottom of the page, or in the settings menu in the App. You may also exercise your rights using the mechanisms described in the Interest Based Advertising section of this Policy above.
You also have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process Personal Information, for example, if you submit a deletion request, we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.
To submit your California Consumer Rights Requests: You may submit a request to exercise your California Consumer Rights through one of the mechanisms described below. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional Personal Information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one. In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.
To exercise your California Consumer Rights to Know, Delete, or Opt-Out of Sale, or for additional information, please submit a request to 800-236-1119. You may also exercise your right to Opt-Out of Sale using the mechanisms described in the Interest Based Advertising section of this Policy above.
Finally, you may also submit a verifiable consumer request through an authorized agent. To do so please be prepared for your agent to provide a signed permission to do so, to verify their own identity with us, and to directly confirm with us that you provided the agent permission to submit the request.
California’s “Shine the Light” Law. California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section §1798.83) provides certain rights to California residents that have an established business relationship with us with regard to the disclosure of certain types of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To opt-out of having your Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please submit a request using one of the California consumer rights request methods designated above.
Data Retention Periods
TreeHouse may retain your Personal Information:
for as long as necessary to comply with any legal requirement;
on our backup and disaster recovery systems in accordance with our backup and disaster recovery policies and procedures;
for as long as necessary to protect our legal interests or otherwise pursue our legal rights and remedies;
in order to use Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information. and
for data that has been aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous in such a manner that you are no longer identifiable, indefinitely.
TreeHouse may also retain information related to any requests to exercise privacy rights for as long as needed or is permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.
Modifications of the Privacy Policy
