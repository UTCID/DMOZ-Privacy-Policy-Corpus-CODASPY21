Return Policy
Our goal is to make purchasing and returning products a very simple process. We realize that not everything you purchase from us is exactly what you wanted.
The product description page typically will state if the product is returnable or not. However, the most commonly non-returnable items are:
Firearms
Ammunition
Food
Surplus
Simple Product Return Process:
Product was purchased within 90 days.
Determine if the product is a returnable product. Some products the manufacturers prefer to handle the returns and repairs, please check the product description page for any specific return procedures.
Ensure the product is still in the original packaging and is not damaged. Damaged packaging is subject to a 25% restocking fee, products showing excess usage may be returned to the customer.
Please email us or use our Live Chat (Monday-Friday 8 am to 5 pm, Central time) to obtain a Return Authorization Number and receive a prepaid UPS label.
Securely package the product in a box and affix the prepaid UPS label that we supply.
