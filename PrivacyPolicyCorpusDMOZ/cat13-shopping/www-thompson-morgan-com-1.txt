Why we collect your personal information
There are several main purposes for gathering your personal information: for marketing activities, deliveries, profiling, and for transaction processing.
Transaction processing: when you purchase a product from our website or catalogue, you become a customer of Thompson & Morgan, so we retain personal information on you whilst you remain an active customer of ours and also for a short time when you no longer order from us.
When you make an enquiry about a product of ours, we also retain the personal information you give us in your enquiry for a limited period of time. Our Data Retention policy below explains how long we keep your personal information. In all cases for transaction processing, our legal basis for processing your personal data is contract.
Deliveries: We will need to print your name and address on delivery notes and despatch labels, in order to deliver any goods you order from us. Please note that in order to resolve delivery queries once goods are on their way to you, that we may print your phone number on the despatch label to aid the courier in the event of a query about your delivery. You may receive an email from our courier with updates on your delivery including information to enable you to track your order. Our couriers destroy any personal data provided by us once your goods have been delivered.
Marketing activities: we have separated out each marketing activity that your personal data is used for below. Note that any customers or website visitors who don't want to receive marketing communications from us can email ccare@thompson-morgan.com to update their preferences. Thompson & Morgan will never send you a marketing communication that doesn't have a method of opting out from our marketing communications contained within it.
Profiling: we plan to build profiles from all the information that we have about you, so that we can do two things; firstly we want to surface product advertisements and gardening hints and tips to you via social media. Secondly we want to develop a 1:1 communications programme with you, so that can send you email communications that are specific to you. We believe this will make our dialogue with you more personal and more accurate. You can opt out of having your data used in profiling at any time by emailing ccare@thompson-morgan.com or calling 0333 400 0033. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
Social media: we want to increase our engagement with you on social media, which we hope we will help us reduce the number of catalogues we produce in the medium term. So, you may see product advertisements & gardening hints and tips from us on some social media platforms, including Facebook. You can opt out of T&M messages on social media at any time by emailing ccare@thompson-morgan.com or calling 0333 400 0033. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Catalogues: we will provide our customers with at least one full range catalogue each year. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest
• Product offers: from time to time Thompson & Morgan will send you discounted product offers via email or post. These offers are based on our knowledge of the products you have ordered or enquired about and your visits to our website, if you have visited it. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest
• Inserts: Thompson & Morgan will sometimes include inserts from carefully selected and reputable organisations into your deliveries. Please note that at the time of writing, it is not possible to opt out of these inserts. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Newsletters: we will email customers and enquirers newsletters containing horticultural tips and growing/maintenance instructions for our products. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Competitions: Thompson & Morgan sometimes offer competition entry via both email, the website and coupon. Competition entry is sometimes conditional on providing us with additional demographic information about you, which in turn allows us to further customise our communications and product offers to you. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Surveys: We occasionally survey portions of our customer and website visitor database to find out more about your experience using Thompson & Morgan and to find out how we can improve our service delivery to you. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Site optimisation: the device-level information we automatically gather about you allows us to optimise the speed and performance of the website for you. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Web analytics: we use cookies and the device-level personal information to build a profile of your use of the site, including any transactions that you make, so that we can personalise our marketing offers to you, and to customise your website visits. To find out more please see our Cookie Policy. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest.
• Anonymous web analytics: Thompson & Morgan aggregates and anonymises all your activity on our website for traffic analysis, to help measure and improve the website performance. We also use this anonymised data to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Your personal data is anonymised in this process, so there is no requirement under GDPR for a legal basis for processing.
• Business Insight: your personal data and any order history goes into our business insight platform. We use this application to gain detailed insight into how to improve our product and service offering to you, and to also create statistical models to predict your likely purchasing intentions in the future.

ccare@thompson-morgan.com or calling 0333 400 0033. The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest, you can request that we remove your details from our business insight process.

data with other reputable organisations mainly in the following sectors; charities, houseware, finance & gardening, for the purposes of postal marketing.

How we protect and where we store your personal information
The personal information we collect about you is stored within our secure UK IT Data Centre. No identifiable personal information is stored or shipped to non-UK/EU locations. Your personal information is stored in databases which are encrypted at rest, providing the highest level of security. All personal information is moved to and from our website www.thompson-morgan.com via an HTTPS connection, which means that the transfer of data is also encrypted. Access to your personal data held on databases managed by Thompson & Morgan or its' authorised subcontractors, is granted only when there is a need to use the data, no permanent access exists.
Thompson & Morgan is amending our IT policies to further protect your personal information by adopting 'Privacy by Design', an information management standard that seeks to anonymise personal data held in commercial databases to further protect that information. You can find out more about this anonymization process by following this link.
How long we keep your personal information
Thompson & Morgan will only use your personal information for as long as you remain a customer, and for a short time after your last order. The maximum amount of time that Thompson & Morgan will retain your personal information in a data archive is seven years, except in the event of a legal dispute. This seven-year limit is based on the legal requirement to maintain details of transactions as described in the Companies Act 2006. We have listed below how long we store your personal information for, which depends on your relationship with Thompson & Morgan.
If you made a purchase from us: we will keep the information you gave us and details of what you bought for up to seven years from the date of the last transaction with us. After that time your personal data will be anonymised, but we will keep your purchase and marketing
history.
If you enquired about a product, but did not make a purchase: we will keep the information we have on you as an enquirer for up to three years. After that time your personal data will be anonymised, but we will keep your enquiry and marketing history.
If you wrote to us: we will keep any correspondence with you for six years, although we do keep this information longer if your correspondence is a complaint.
Sharing your personal information with other organisations
Subcontractors: Thompson & Morgan use carefully selected subcontractors to assist in the management and structure of business information for its' own marketing purposes. The information these subcontractors process includes the personal information we gather about you and your transaction and web history with us.

The participating retailers are active in the clothing, collectables, food & wine, gardening, gadgets & entertainment, health & beauty, household goods, and home interiors categories. They share information on what their customers buy. Epsilon Abacus analyses this pooled information to help the retailers understand consumers' wider buying patterns. From this information, retailers can tailor their communications, sending people suitable offers that should be of interest to them, based on what they like to buy.

This type of "screen access" qualifies as a transfer of data under the GDPR, even if no files are "moved" outside the data centre.
GDPR allows data to be transferred outside the EEA in the absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission when "appropriate or suitable safeguards" are present (see Article 46).
