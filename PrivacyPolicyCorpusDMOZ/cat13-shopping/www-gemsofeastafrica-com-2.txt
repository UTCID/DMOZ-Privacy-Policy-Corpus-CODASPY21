About Us
BUYING FROM SOURCE, SELLING AT MUCH BELOW WHOLESALE PRICES TO EVERYONE. We are fine facet rough, fine cut stones and fine crystal dealers, based in London, UK, buying directly from Source in East Africa, direct from small scale community-based miners whom we’ve known personally over the years and built long term ‘win win’ relationships with. We select the best stones one by one, buying only the best, cleanest, brightest and most visually appealing stones from miner lots (literally cherry picking from lots) and offering them out here on our website, at mine direct prices! We are 4th Generation Gemstone dealers. We have plenty of experience in buying and selling of faceting rough and fine cut stones and understand the quality, appeal factors, the importance of good cutting on a stone and how it adds value to the stone. All stones are ethically sourced. We set the standard in facet rough grading of gemstones. We are very well known by the miners in East Africa and get to see first hand, material, as it comes out of the mines in some cases within hours of it being mined. We speak local languages and work very well with local miners and understand their needs. We know almost all miners in East Africa and they know us. We have built relationships with them of trust and long-term supply and in many cases guide them in their mining activities. Since most are small aritisanal, community-based mining activities, most of the nearby villages and communities are involved in the mining and share in the profit for their communities upliftment and well being.
