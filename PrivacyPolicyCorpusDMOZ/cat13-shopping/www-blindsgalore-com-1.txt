Privacy Shades, Blinds & Window Treatments
Opaque products to maintain privacyRouteless slats avoid light seepageAdd a liner for increased opaquenessLayer coverings for light versatilityGood for bed, bath & streetside rooms
read more...
Privacy blinds and shades are opaque, or non-transparent, enough to prevent view-through, even when backlit.
Perfect for rooms facing the street or a neighbor, privacy shades or routeless blinds are perfect for keeping the inside of your home hidden. Some blind styles, such as woven woods, will require an added privacy liner to provide the extra opacity needed. We also recommend choosing a top down/bottom up lift option or layering your treatments, like a faux wood combined with drapery, to best balance your light control and privacy needs. While these products will block view-through, they will not necessarily block all light like our blackout shades.

"Truly Dark"
By Prubinster
from North Carolina
These shades are great black-out shades.
I added the side channels to cover the light that leaks out of the sides and not only do these channels take care of this leakage, but they also add a sleak, clean look tto the shades.
I last ordered Levelor's black-out cellular shades and found them to be very heavy and too thick.
The Bali shades seem to be of a slightly higher quality.
