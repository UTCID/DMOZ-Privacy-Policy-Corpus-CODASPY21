7. Limitation of Liability
YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CCVIDEO, ITS MEMBERS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES
OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, “CCVIDEO”, CCVIDEO PARTY” or CCVIDEO PARTIES”) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER CONTRACT, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OR FAILURE OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU
IN CONNECTION WITH PURCHASE OF GOODS FROM US OR THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT A CCVIDEO PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CCVIDEO
PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF GOODS THROUGH THE PLATFORM OR THIS LIMITED WARRANTY WILL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SUCH GOODS. IF ANY
APPLICABLE AUTHORITY HOLDS ANY PORTION OF THIS SECTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
You agree that the provisions contained in this section will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement and/or your account, or of discontinuation of all or any
portion of the CCVideo Platform. Some states, provinces or territories do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
8. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold CCVideo harmless
from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses
(including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from or related to: (i) your use of and access to the CCVideo Platform; (ii) your violation of any term of this
Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties contained herein; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including
without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any claim or damages that arise
as a result of any of your User Content or any content that is submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party's access and use of any portion of the CCVideo Platform
with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code. You agree that the provisions contained in this section will survive any termination or expiration of
this Agreement and/or your account, or of discontinuation of all or any portion of the CCVideo Platform.
9. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action/Arbitration Waiver
Any claim, dispute or controversy between you and CCVideo that arises in whole or in part from all or any portion of your access or use of the CCVideo Platform or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation of validity thereof, including the determination of the scope of
applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a "Dispute") shall be decided exclusively in small claims court or by binding arbitration as set forth in this section, and
not by courts of general jurisdiction.
If a Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in small claims court, you may litigate the Dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or
in Orange County, California.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court,
and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to this Agreement,
the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and CCVideo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury.
YOU AND CCVideo AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT THIS CLASS ARBITRATION WAIVER APPLIES TO YOU AND TO ANY CHILD OR OTHER PERSON ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU REGISTER WITH THE
CCVideo PLATFORM.
If you elect to seek arbitration in connection with a Dispute, you must first send to CCVideo, by certified mail, a written notice of the claim ("Notice") to the
CCVideo address set forth at the end of this Agreement. If CCVideo elects to seek arbitration in connection with a Dispute, it will send, by certified mail,
a written Notice to the address used for your CCVideo account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by CCVideo, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim
or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If CCVideo and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice
is received, you or CCVideo may file a claim in small claims court or commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by CCVideo or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration
at www.jamsadr.com. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after CCVideo receives notice that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your
payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000. The arbitration will be governed by the
JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures ("JAMS Rules") in effect at the time
of the Dispute, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by JAMS, Inc. ("JAMS"). JAMS' Rules and Forms are available online at www.jamsadr.com, by calling
JAMS at 1-800-352-5267 or by writing to CCVideo at the address set forth at the end of this Agreement. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Unless CCVideo and you agree
otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. (If you reside outside of the United States, any arbitration
hearings will take place in your country of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you, but will remain subject to the JAMS Rules including the JAMS Rules
regarding the selection of an arbitrator). The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of CCVideo's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was
selected (or if CCVideo did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then CCVideo will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000,
whichever is greater. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as expressly set forth herein,
the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.
