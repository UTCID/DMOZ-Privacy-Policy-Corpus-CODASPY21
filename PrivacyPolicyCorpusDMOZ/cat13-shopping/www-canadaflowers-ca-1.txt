Customer Service
Privacy
Privacy
At Canada Flowers we regard our customers' privacy to be critically important.
Your confidence in our policies and practices to protect and safeguard
your privacy matter to us a great deal.
All customer information is kept strictly confidential.
We do not sell your private information to any third party, advertising
company or marketing agency.
We use your private information strictly for order processing purposes
and -- only if you give us permission in advance -- to send occasional
reminders and updates about important occasions such as Christmas or
Mother's Day (about 8-12 per year).
If you agree to receive email reminders or updates from us, and then
change your mind, you can stop receiving these at any time. We only ever
send out about 8-12 per year.
We never send out promotional email without first receiving your permission
for us to do so.
We never store your credit card information on our web server. This
information is erased within moments of successful, secure transmission
of your data to our order processing systems.
We have the technology to save your information in order to speed up
future orders using an email username/password combination. Again, this
information is kept in a secure, private database and it never contains
any credit card data.
