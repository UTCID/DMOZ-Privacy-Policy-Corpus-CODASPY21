Privacy Statement
Introduction
This policy describes the information Safetyshop (Brady Corporation Ltd) may collect through the use of the services we offer, how we collect it and how it is used.
This policy also addresses precautions we take to protect your privacy and how to contact us with data privacy questions or requests.
Policy Topics:
Section A - Personal Information
Section B - Children Under the Age of 18
Section C - Passive Information Collected
Section D - Cookies & Internet Tags
Section E - Active Information Volunteered
Section F - Duration of the Processing
Section G - Your Rights
Section H - Safety & Confidentiality
Section I - Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities
Section J - Changes
Section K - Contact Information and Enforcement
Section A: Personal Information
Personal information is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual’s name, address, email address, and/or phone number, and may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or device.
We will actively collect your personal information through direct contact that you make with us.
Examples of this includes information about yourself and the company you work for when you register an account with us. It may include your name, your contact details, your role in the company and transactional information if you make a purchase. Sections C, D and E contain more details about the type of information. Sections F, H and I contain more details about how we store this information and Sections G and K outline your rights in regards to this and how to contact us.
We will passively collect personal information from you simply from your visit to our website. For more information about the data we will collect, see Sections C and D below. We also obtain personal information from third parties who have verified their legal right to provide personal information to us.
You may always choose not to contact us by email, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information on our website. Your choice to not participate in these activities online will not impair your ability to browse our website, or to read or download information offered on the site.
Section B: Children Under the Age of 18
This site is not directed to children under the age of eighteen (18) and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
Section C: Passive Information Collected
This is information passively collected during your visit to our website. This information is used to help us understand how our site is being used so that we may continually improve it’s content, performance, suitability and usefulness. We collect two types of passive data: navigational data and device information.
Navigational Data:
Navigational data includes log files and clickstream data. Navigational data can identify a user’s web browser and operating system, when and for how long a user visits a website, what pages a user views on a website, and the address of the website that the user was visiting previously.
We collect this information and use it to administer a website, improve website content, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes.
Device information:
Device information is your IP address, hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information, including phone number.
We collect this information to associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Account.
Section D: Cookies and Internet Tags
To serve our online users, we use “cookies” and similar files to customise your browsing experience with us. Cookies are small data files transferred to your computer, mobile phone or other device by your web browser at the request of a website. Cookies fall into two broad categories:
Session cookies – these cookies allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browsing session. Session cookies are therefore temporary and once you close your browser, all session cookies are deleted. Session cookies are used to aid in website navigation and to collect statistical information. A common example is the shopping cart function, where the website will store details of your shopping cart as you proceed through the checkout process.
Persistent cookies – these cookies remain on your computer or device for the period time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time you visit the website that created the particular cookie. Persistent cookies also aid in website navigation and collecting statistical information, and are used to customize a website for a user, such as by storing passwords and preferences so that users do not have to reenter them each time they visit a website.
A common example is an auto login or “remember me” function after you first register with a website.
Functional Cookies (Persistent)
These cookies allow our website to remember information you provide to us via our website and choices you make (such as your username, items you have put into your shopping cart and products you have viewed recently). The cookies allow our website to enhance the service we can offer you (as well as providing some degree of personalisation to our website).
In accordance with EC Regulations, we require your consent to transfer these cookies to your computer or device and by using our website you agree that we can transfer these cookies to your computer or device.
Performance Cookies (Session)
These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as the referring domain, frequency of visits to certain web pages and the time spent by users during each visit to our website. These cookies do not collect personally identifying information and the data collected is anonymous. We use these cookies to monitor the services we provide via our website and to make improvements to the website as a whole.
In accordance with EC Regulations, we require your consent to transfer these cookies to your computer or device and by using our website you agree that we can transfer these cookies to your computer or device.
Other Type of Cookies such as “Retargeting”, “Behavioural” or Banner Advertising
We work with selected third party advertising companies who may set cookies on your computer or device during your visit to our website. These advertising companies use the information collected in these cookies for personalized and non-personalised advertising.
For cookies set by third parties (Google Analytics) we kindly refer you to the statements set forth by these parties on their respective websites. Beware, we do not have any influence on the content of these statements nor on the content of the cookies of these third parties: Google Analytics cookies.

The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser prompt you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.
Internet Tags:
Internet tags (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are similar to cookies, but they are smaller and are used to collect data such as IP address and browser type related to the user's computer.
We use this information to monitor activity for the purpose of future improvement of our website.
Section E: Active Information Volunteered
In addition to the passive information collected as described above, this website actively collects information as you volunteer it when making certain requests on the website.
Some of the information collected is personal or unique to you (see Section A: Personal Information). We collect personal data from site registrants and visitors to the website on a voluntary basis. Visitors are not required to provide this information.
If during your visit to one of our websites you complete a form, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction, this website may collect your name, company name, business address, business e-mail address, business phone number, business fax number, job title, industry sector, and/or credit card information.
To protect credit card numbers, we outsource this information to a certified payment processor via a hosted payment page on our website in accordance with PCI DSS regulations. The provider returns the credit card number to us as a token.
We do not see, process or store customers’ raw credit card information in any of our systems or databases. We are PCI compliant and attest to such via an annual SAQ-D and quarterly vulnerability scans performed by and attested to by an outside agency.

All processing of personal data is based on a commercial, contractual basis to supply goods and services to the business community. However any data we collect that can identify an individual will be protected and treated as local laws dictate.

These providers have access to the information that they require to perform their functions but are strictly forbidden from using it for any other purposes.
