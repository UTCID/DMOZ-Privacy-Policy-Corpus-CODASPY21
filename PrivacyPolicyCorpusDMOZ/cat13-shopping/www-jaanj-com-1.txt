What are cookies? How does jaanj.com use cookies on its site?
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. Jaan J. uses cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.
Jaan J. uses cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. Through our use of cookies, Jaan J. also tracks and preserves the identity of the website you visited immediately before visiting jaanj.com.
Jaan J. does not track any information about your use of other websites.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, Jaan J. will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from our site. Jaan J. will not be able to recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.
Credit Card Safety?
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank or credit card company cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card.
Protecting your order information is important to us. Jaan J. uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet.
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones Jaan J. uses to process orders at jaanj.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower portion of your browser window after accessing the server.
If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then the SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."
If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please order by emailing us at cs@jaanj.com.
State the item(s) you would like to purchase and a representative will contact you within 24 business hours to process your purchase.
If someone steals your credit card information or uses your credit card in an unauthorized manner on our site (as determined by your credit card company) - through no fault of your own - Jaan J. will NOT cover any charges your credit card company doesn't.
If you're not quite comfortable shopping online, or would prefer to make your purchase via other means, just e-mail us at cs@jaanj.com and a representative will call you within 24 business hours to take your order. Please be sure to have your information on hand in order to expedite your purchase(s).
