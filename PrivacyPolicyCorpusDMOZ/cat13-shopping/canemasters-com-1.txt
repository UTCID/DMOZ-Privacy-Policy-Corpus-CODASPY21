Privacy Notice
Privacy Policy:
At WWW.CANEMASTERS.COM, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to protecting your privacy at all times, in all situations. The information we collect when you become a customer is used to process your orders and to provide a more personalized experience on our site. Our site uses a 128 bit encrypted SSL to increase the security of our customer’s information. However, we at “Cane Masters” cannot guarantee complete security of stored information, even though we have taken every precaution by encrypting pages and installing our SSL certificate to prevent stolen information.
How Do We Use the Information We Collect?
When you become a CANEMASTERS.COM customer, we ask you to fill out a form that requests your name, address and e-mail. CANEMASTERS.COM will NEVER share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis.
Your name and address information is used solely to process orders unless your prior consent is given. Without your consent, this information will NEVER be sold, given, rented or traded to others for purposes other than order fulfillment.
Your demographic information (gender, date of birth, etc.) will be used for several security purposes, to ensure you are who you say you are and in fact you are paying with your credit cards and not someone using your stolen credit cards.
Refer-A-Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.
