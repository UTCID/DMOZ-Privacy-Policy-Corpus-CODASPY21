Privacy policy
Privacy policy
The privacy and protection of your personal information is my top priority, and is especially important in my business of custom-made jewelry.
I will not spam you or solicit you using the information provided to me.
We only use customer information to fulfill your order, to settle disputes, or to provide customer support. Your personal information (name, address, email, phone) as provided to me by Shopify will only be used by me as needed to provide my services.
Cascadia Design Studio will not sell, lease, share or give your personal information to anyone or any company, except as follows:
Respond to legal process or to government requests (i.e. taxes)
Enforce my agreements, terms and policies;
Prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues;
Protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers or others. If and when required, we will communicate with you about your order status via email.
I have no access to your payment account details: Shopify Payments and PayPal process your financial information independently of me. At no time does your credit or debit card number pass to Cascadia Design Studio, or anyone else outside the banking system.
Your transaction information will be stored on the Shopify system as long as I have my store on the Shopify platform.
