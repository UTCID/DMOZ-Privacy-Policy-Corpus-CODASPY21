These Terms are a binding contract between you and Northern Brewer, LLC (including its affiliates, “Northern Brewer,” “we” and “us”).  You must agree to and accept all of these Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.  Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.  These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy and on our Customer Service page.

Will these Terms ever change?
We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.northernbrewer.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
What about my privacy?
Northern Brewer takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current Northern Brewer Privacy Policy, please click here.

You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.  If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services.  We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.

What are my rights in www.northernbrewer.com?
The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, Reviews, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.  You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (a) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (b) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Northern Brewer’s) rights.
All trademarks, service marks, and trade names (collectively the “Marks”) that appear on this website are proprietary to Northern Brewer or the other respective owners of such Marks. You may not display or reproduce the Marks in any manner without the prior written consent of Northern Brewer, and you may not remove or otherwise modify in any manner any trademark notices from any content offered or received through the website.
You understand that Northern Brewer owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!
Do I have to grant any licenses to Northern Brewer or to other users?
From time to time, Northern Brewer may allow you to post reviews, comments, photos, or similar materials on the website (collectively, “Reviews”). We welcome your comments regarding our Services, including our website. However, any Reviews you submit to Northern Brewer must not harass, slander, malign, libel, defame, threaten, or otherwise violate any rights of any third-parties and must not include any profanity, obscene, indecent, pornographic, defamatory or unlawful material.
By posting a Review on the website, you hereby grant Northern Brewer an unrestricted, assignable, sublicensable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid up license throughout the world to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, transmit, communicate to the public, publicly perform on a through-to-the-audience basis, create derivative works from, and otherwise use and exploit all Reviews you post to the website, for any purpose, including promoting and marketing Northern Brewer and the Services. You further grant Northern Brewer a royalty-free license to use the name, image, and likeness of any person identifiable in any Review you post to the website. By posting a Review, you waive any and all rights of publicity, privacy or any other rights of a similar nature, in addition to any moral rights you may have in your Review. Except for materials provided to you by Northern Brewer through the website, you represent, warrant, and covenant that (a) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of Reviews that you post to the website, or you have all rights, licenses, consents, and releases that are necessary to grant to Northern Brewer the rights in your Reviews as contemplated under these Terms, and (b) the Reviews you post to the website do not (i) infringe, misappropriate or violate the rights of any party or entity, including a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, rights of publicity, rights of privacy or other intellectual property or proprietary rights; (ii) constitute or result in defamation, libel, slander, or the violation of any applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, restrictions on obscenity, child pornography, wiretap laws or other similar restrictions on nonconsensual recording, or otherwise); (iii) require Northern Brewer to obtain any licenses from or make any payments in any amounts to any third party throughout the world; or (iv) introduce viruses, time-bombs, worms, cancel bots, Trojan Horses and/or other harmful or malicious code.  You agree not to submit Reviews that are or could be interpreted to be inaccurate, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, vulgar, offensive, objectionable, hateful, or promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, or hatred, as determined by Northern Brewer in its sole discretion.
Monitoring.
Northern Brewer has no obligation to monitor this website or any portion thereof. However, we reserve the right to review any Reviews and remove, delete, redact or otherwise modify such Reviews, in our sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, without notice or further obligation to you. Northern Brewer has no obligation to display or post any Reviews. Northern Brewer, subject to our Privacy Policy, reserves the right to disclose, at any time and from time to time, any information or posted content that it deems necessary or appropriate, including without limitation to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, contractual obligation, legal, dispute process, or governmental request.
Feedback.
We also appreciate hearing from our users and welcome your comments regarding the Services. Please be advised, however, that if you send us creative ideas, suggestions, inventions, or materials (“Creative Ideas”), we will: (a) own, exclusively, all now known or later discovered rights to the Creative Ideas; (b) not be subject to any obligation of confidentiality and will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Creative Ideas; and (c) be entitled to unrestricted use of the Creative Ideas for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to you or any other person.
What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like Northern Brewer, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright.  We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here.  To learn more about the DMCA, click here.
Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk.  We are not liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with such information and content.   We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.  We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.
You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.  You will keep all your registration information accurate and current.  You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.
The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Northern Brewer. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Northern Brewer is not responsible for such risks.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.
Northern Brewer has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Northern Brewer will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.
Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.  You agree that Northern Brewer shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
If there is a dispute between participants on this website, or between users and any third party, you agree that Northern Brewer is under no obligation to become involved.  In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Northern Brewer, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.  If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
Will Northern Brewer ever change the Services?
We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.  We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.  We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
Does www.northernbrewer.com cost anything?
Prices. The price for products available for purchase through the website will be displayed to you on the website. The prices displayed do not include taxes. Any applicable taxes will be communicated to you before you place an order.
For more information on billing, product warranties, returns, shipping and other related information, please visit our Customer Service page.
What if I want to stop using www.northernbrewer.com?
You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at Brewmaster@NorthernBrewer.com.  Please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.
Northern Brewer is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.  Northern Brewer has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so please keep that in mind before you ask us to delete your account.
If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at Brewmaster@NorthernBrewer.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.
Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.  By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including, without limitation, the arbitration agreement.
What else do I need to know?

Released Parties Defined. “Released Parties” include Northern Brewer and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, and licensors.
YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (a) YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND THE RELEASED PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES AS TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES LISTED ON THE WEBSITE, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT; (b) THE RELEASED PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (i) THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (ii) THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (iii) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, (iv) THE QUALITY OF ANY GOODS OR SERVICE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS, OR (v) ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED; AND (c) ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE WEBSITE IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.
Limitation of Liability.
YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE RELEASED PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF NORTHERN BREWER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM: (a) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (b) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH, FROM, OR AS A RESULT OF THE SERVICES; (c) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (d) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY USER OR THIRD PARTY ON THE WEBSITE; (e) YOUR RELIANCE ON CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE BY US; OR (f) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW, THE RELEASED PARTIES’ MAXIMUM LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR YOUR USE OF CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE), WILL NOT EXCEED $100.
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Released Parties from and against any claims, actions, or demands, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, alleging or resulting from (i) your use of or reliance on any third-party content, (ii) your use of or reliance on any Content, or (iii) your breach of these Terms. We will provide notice to you promptly of any such claim, suit, or proceeding.
Indemnity.
You agree to indemnify and hold the Released Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third-party claims relating to (a) your use of or reliance on the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account) or any Content (including, without limitation, any third-party content included therein), and (b) your violation of these Terms.  In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).
Assignment.
You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Northern Brewer’s prior written consent.  We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.
Choice of Law; Arbitration.
These Terms and the relationship between you and Northern Brewer are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.  For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with NORTHERN BREWER and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Both you and Northern Brewer acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Northern Brewer’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.
(a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Minnesota. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”) of JAMS/Endispute LLC (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.  Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) Costs of Arbitration. The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Northern Brewer will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. Northern Brewer will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
(c) Small Claims Court. Furthermore, either you or Northern Brewer may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Minneapolis, Minnesota or any United States county where you live or work.
(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND NORTHERN BREWER WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Northern Brewer are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Northern Brewer over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND NORTHERN BREWER WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
(f) Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Northern Brewer | 2221 HWY 36 W | Roseville, MN 55113 postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.
(g) Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Northern Brewer to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and Northern Brewer agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Miscellaneous.
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Northern Brewer may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.  The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  You and Northern Brewer agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Northern Brewer, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Northern Brewer, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Northern Brewer in any respect whatsoever.  Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and Northern Brewer agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
