Return Policy
All Closeout Sale items are non-refundable, and can only be returned for a size exchange or store credit.
US Returns
We include return shipping labels with all orders shipped within the United States.
If you live within the United States follow the directions on the packing slips enclosed with your order. Give us a call if you have questions.
Items in new condition (tags still attached and unworn), purchased from Showers Pass online store may be returned for a refund or size exchange within 30 days of purchase. If you received free shipping on your order, you will be refunded the amount paid for the returned items less the cost of flat-rate shipping. We won't charge you shipping for partially-returned orders, as long as the items you keep total more than the free shipping threshold. We cannot offer refunds on items that have been worn outside or on the bike. Likewise, for any orders containing free gifts: if your returns drop you below an order value that qualified you for a gift-with-purchase but you want to keep the gift, you will be refunded the amount paid for the returned items less the current retail price of the gift item.
We can only offer refunds on items purchased directly from showerspass.com or our Portland showroom. If your Showers Pass product was purchased elsewhere, please contact us to arrange an exchange or return for store credit.
Bundle Returns
Returning a combo item for replacement is the same as returning any other item. Refunds, however, are different: if you only return part of the combo deal, the combo discount will be subtracted from your refund. For example:
Combo Deal
Refund
Item 1: $100
Item 2: $50
Combo Discount: -$50
Total: $100
Item 1 (returning for a refund): $100
Combo Discount: -$50
Refund: $50
International Returns
If you live outside the US, and want to return new items please include a copy of the original packing slip with a note on which item/ size/ color you would like to exchange for or note if you would like a refund. Exchange shipping charges may apply for some items.
