From time to time, we are asked why we called ourselves Beagle Internet. We’re so named for a variety of reasons. The canine breed is well known for it’s even temper, gentle disposition, loyalty, intelligence and keen sense of smell and hunting prowess. That sounds like us!
We’re also named after the HMS Beagle, the ship that Charles Darwin sailed upon on his famous voyage. The voyage and Darwin’s associated theories shaped modern natural sciences in the most profound and fundamental ways. We hope to do the same for the Telecommunications Industry.
Finally, one of our customer’s once pointed out that Royal Australian Navy stewards are colloquially referred to as Beagles. The parallels are obvious – we both perform a critical support role that allows you to get on with your day-to-day duties!
