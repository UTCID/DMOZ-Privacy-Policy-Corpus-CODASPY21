Privacy Policy
We at Nu Imaging Professional and our affiliated companies are committed to
respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection
and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")
you share with us.
Nu Imaging Professional has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can
understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an
individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or
other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether
at work or at home. In general, you can visit our Web pages without telling
us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may
transfer that Information within Nu Imaging Professional or to our third-party service
providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries
or jurisdictions around the world.
Nu Imaging Professional strives to comply with all applicable laws around the
globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements
may vary from country to country, Nu Imaging Professional intends to adhere
to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection
with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries
that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal
Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal
Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred,
or retained.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies.
A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to

choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose
to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user
