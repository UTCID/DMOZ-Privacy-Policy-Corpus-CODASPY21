Privacy
General
Many of the ways in which you interact with the Jenny Craig Web site (www.jennycraig.com and www.jennycraig.ca) (each, a “Site”) and the Jenny Craig mobile app (the “App”) allow us to learn about you. This Privacy Statement describes the type of information we collect from you when you visit our Site,
use our App, or become a Jenny Craig member and explains how Jenny Craig may use and disclose such information, as well as your ability to control certain uses of it.
Information Collection
Information You Provide
Jenny Craig collects information from you when you choose to share it with us to use our Site or App, become a Jenny Craig member, create an online account with us, request information from us, sign up for newsletters or our email list, post in our chat rooms or message boards, or otherwise contact us. The categories of information we collect are your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photo/image, gender, date of birth, health information such as your current weight and goal weight, food consumption, and measurements, and, if you are a Jenny Craig customer, a credit/debit card number or other financial information including information about your purchases from us, as well as your Jenny ID which is assigned upon membership. If you access your account through our website, or if you use our App, we collect your user name and password. In addition, if you allow the App to have your location data, that data is only used to help you identify the nearest Jenny Craig Center. It is not stored. You have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal some personally identifiable information to us. If you do not provide all “required” information, however, some portions of our Site, App, or membership features will not work properly for you, or you will not be able to register or access certain sections of the Site. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other parties or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.
Information Automatically Collected
We may use cookies, web beacons, log files, or other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to and users of our Sites and App, to deliver online advertisements that we think would be more relevant to your interests, and to monitor interactions with our emails and online advertisements. For example, we may automatically collect certain information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, software version, and the domain name from which you accessed the Site or App. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Site or App, the areas or pages of the Site or App that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using the Site or App, the number of times you return to the Site, other click-stream or Site or App usage data, and emails or ads that you open, forward or click-through to our Site or App.
Please note that our Sites use Google Analytics, a service that transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not identify individual users or visitors, nor does it associate users’ or visitors’ IP addresses with any other data held by Google. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage. In addition, we use Flurry, another analytics tool, to track statistics about downloads, frequency of use of our App, ratings, and similar metrics. Flurry does not collect your personally identifiable information.
Cookies and Other Tracking Methods
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your hard drive when you visit our Site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses or other tracking tools, for a number of reasons. For example, these tools may (a) allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it; (b) help us to tailor our Site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests; and (c) allow us to better understand how you and others use our Site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are the most popular. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly if you do. Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. To learn more about the use of cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and to know your choices about not having this information used by certain Service Providers (defined below), please click here.
“Do-Not-Track” (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity via cookies or other tracking technologies. We do not currently respond to Do-Not-Track browser signals or mechanisms. See the privacy policies of any linked sites with respect to how they respond to DNT signals, as their policies may differ from our own.
