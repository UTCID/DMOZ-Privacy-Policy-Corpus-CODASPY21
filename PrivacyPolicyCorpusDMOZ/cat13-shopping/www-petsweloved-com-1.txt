2-18-20 VIP Pet Casket Makes Moving Much Easier - A year after I buried my cat, I had to dig him up to take him with me when I moved. The seal in the casket is so good that there wasnt even an odor! It made things much easier and as pleasant as possible. Emaline

12-26-19 Value Medium White Pet Casket
My Emmy Lou is out of pain, now in heaven - I had to leave her in the Vet's freezer because I couldn't find a casket where I live. I had to go online, which I usually don't do. I found what I was looking for at Pets We Loved. Steve was great. I ordered it on Monday and it got here by Wednesday.
The casket looked great and the seal tape impressed me. I wasn't able to pick her up at the Vet so my friends went to pick her up. Steve suggested the Vet could help with putting the seal tape on the casket. Cheryl Jackson
11-24-19 Deluxe Gold Large Pet Casket
One Of Those Things You Wish You Never Had To Use - But when you do, you want the best for your loved family member. I didn't even take it out of the box for a few weeks because I instinctively knew the day I did I would have to use it. So I waited, hoping, praying that the situation would change. But when it didn't and my precious dog passed, I was so glad to know I was prepared. He fit into it beautifully and he looked adorable and at peace. It was well constructed and carried him from the veterinary office to the cemetery without a problem. It held up as they filled in the grave. And I rest well knowing he had a comfy place to rest in an airtight and well constructed container. It was a fair price for a good product. Delivery was overnight. What more could you possibly ask?
