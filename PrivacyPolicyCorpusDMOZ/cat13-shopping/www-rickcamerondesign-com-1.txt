YOUR PRIVACY IS ASSURED
The information we ask you for when you place an order, is only what is needed to process your order, and to contact you about that order when necessary: your name, shipping address, what you are ordering, your email, and your phone number. This is the sum total of what we know about you. We never see your credit card or Paypal information; only our merchant processor receives that information.
We always ask your permission to keep you in our Guest Book (for our use only) for new product announcements, or occasional special offers. You must opt-in or you will not hear from us again. You can opt out at any time, and we will immediately remove you from our mailing list. While you are in our Guest Book, we will contact you no more than about a dozen times a year.
We do not regard any of your information as a 'profit center': we do not lend, trade or sell client information to anyone, under any circumstances, other than as required by law.
