19. Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information
When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely.
Any sensitive information is encrypted and protected while in transit with 256 Bit SSL encryption. When you are on a secure page, a padlock icon will appear on the address bar of web browsers such as Google Chrome.
Our websites are scanned on a regular basis for known vulnerabilities including regular malware scanning. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have authorised access to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. Wonderland Models cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail, and you do so at your own risk. Additionally, while we have implemented security measures to help prevent any unauthorised access or disclosure of your information, we cannot assure or guarantee that the information we collect will never be accessed by unauthorised individuals or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy.
All financial transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.
Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and we also recommend you change your password regularly.
20. Connection Encrypted: High-grade Encryption (AES- 256 bit)
The logo displayed in the right hand side of your screen indicates that Wonderland Models (https://www.wonderlandmodels.com/) is secured by Comodo SSL. As a result we have made our website 100% secure with SSL on all pages.
In simple terms this means that it is very difficult for unauthorised people to view information traveling between computers. It is therefore very unlikely that anyone can read the pages on https://www.wonderlandmodels.com traveling over the network (Internet). We are a Google Certified Shop.
We comply with PCI DSS.

RecyclingRecycle your old electricals with us……If you’re buying a new electrical item, we will recycle your old one for free.Please do not throw electrical equipment (including those items marked with the crossed out wheeled bin symbol) in your bin. This is because:
Unwanted electrical equipment is the UKs fastest growing type of waste.
Many electrical items can be repaired or recycled, saving natural resources and the environment.
If we do not recycle electrical items they will end up in landfill where hazardous substances will leak out and cause soil and water contamination – harming wildlife and also human health.
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires countries to maximise separate collection and environmentally friendly processing of these items. In the UK, distributors including retailers must provide a system which allows all customers buying new electrical equipment the opportunity to recycle their old items free of charge. As a responsible retailer, we have met the requirements placed on us by offering all customers buying new electrical equipment free take-back of their old electricals on a like-for-like basis in our store. Unwanted items should be returned within 28 days of purchasing your new product.
Export to the Republic of Ireland We are no longer able to supply electrical goods to the Republic of Ireland. This is in response to the Irish Environment Protection Agency forcing UK retailers to manage the recycling of such items via a complex and expensive WEEE scheme. In the event that any Irish customers order products containing electric items they will be contacted informing them that we are unable to send items containing WEEE.
We apologies for any inconvenience caused to our Irish customers.  Warranty claims will still be honoured.
Waste Battery RegulationsUnder the Waste Battery Regulations, Wonderland Models are now offering a take back scheme for all portable waste batteries. You can return your waste batteries to our business premises in person (PLEASE DO NOT POST).Alternatively, you can find your local waste portable battery recycling facility at www.recyclenow.com Most supermarkets and shops that sell batteries will have collection bins for used batteries, and some town halls, libraries or schools may also set up collection points. End-users may find stores in their local area more accessible.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is taken back free of charge on a one-for-one, like-for-like basis. Waste batteries including rechargeable batteries are taken back free of charge. You are not obliged to make any purchase when returning old batteries. Each local authority must also accept household WEEE and small batteries free of charge at its recycling facilities. All WEEE and waste batteries must be recycled and should not be placed in any of your household wheelie bins. Make sure you always recycle all your old electrical goods and batteries.
