Fortune Baby Gender Predictor ReviewsThousands of happy moms around the world successfully used Fortunebaby gender prediction test.
We are delighted to share their gender prediction reviews about their experience with Fortune Baby.I just wanted to say thank you. My husband and I used your gender prediction test and was told that I would be having a boy. Everyone told me because of the way I was carrying and the fact I am Sick all the time that I would be having a girl. Well we just had our ultrasound and found out it's a BOY! We are so happy. Now we will have two BOYS! I can't believe it worked!!! Thank you again!I took your gender prediction test in July 2009, and it came up with GIRL. I was a bit skeptical, and took a urine based test that clearly showed BOY. They will not tell you the gender on ultrasounds in our town, so I had to wait until November to find out, and it turns out I should have just gone on Fortune Baby's results after all--we had a girl! Thanks! I passed on my daughters details to find out the gender of her baby and you said she was having a girl. On Wednesday of this week she went for her 21 week scan at the hospital, and yes, she is having a little girl. Thank you for such an accurate predication! I will pass on this site to my friends daughter who is also pregnant.I just wanted to let you know that you were right again! I did a test on my cousin and you guys predicted that she was having a boy she went for her sonogram and sure enough she is. I also did a test for myself but I won't know until the end of next month but I will keep you guys posted. Thanks!!!!!! YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!!!!!!!!!START FORTUNE BABY GENDER PREDICTOR TEST | READ ALL REVIEWS
