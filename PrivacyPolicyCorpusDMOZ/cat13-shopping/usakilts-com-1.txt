USA Kilts are American kilt makers who have been making custom made men’s kilts in authentic clan tartans since 2003.
We offer a full range of kilts from our budget casual kilt (not a “cheap kilt”) to our traditional machine sewn, hand finished kilt.
We specialize in all aspects of highland wear, from different Celtic countries offering Scottish, Irish and Welsh kilts, sporrans, Argyll jackets, hose and other accessories at the best quality for the lowest prices.
