DioxiCare Combo Helps People with Diabetes Maintain Oral Health
Posted: May 26 2016
Proper dental care is essential for people with diabetes because they are particularly susceptible to gum disease. It is important to understand that gum disease in turn aggravates diabetes. One study showed that people with diabetes who had regular dental visits significantly lowered their medical costs (See link below).
Diligent home care is also required. We recommend our two DioxiCare® powerhouse oral care products: DioxiRinse Mouthwash and DioxiBrite Toothpaste. Both kill almost all oral bacteria and remove biofilm, keeping mouth and gums clean.
Gum disease begins with the accumulation of plaque, a biofilm made up mostly of bacteria. High blood sugar associated with diabetes contributes to bacterial growth. Plaque can harden into tartar, a trap for further plaque accumulation. Once tartar starts forming, only a dental professional can remove it. Good dental habits can prevent this accumulation.
Plaque produces toxins that irritate and inflame the gum tissue (gingivitis). Long-term inflammation may lead to periodontitis: pockets between the teeth and gums, bone loss, and possible tooth loss.
Proper home care includes brushing teeth, rinsing, using a proxy brush between teeth, oral irrigation, and flossing. Don’t forget to brush the back of your teeth where plaque accumulates. Most dentists recommend brushing your teeth for a minimum of two minutes.
Many of our customers dip their floss picks and proxy brushes into DioxiRinse for disinfection between teeth. Also a good idea is adding DioxiRinse to your oral irrigator (see instructions on DioxiRinse package). Lastly, gargle with DioxiRinse twice a day, rinsing the back of the throat and tongue where harmful bacteria and biofilm accumulate. This home care routine is not overly time consuming and benefits to oral health are well worth the effort, even if you don’t have diabetes.
Attention to users of chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex) and Listerine. Please see our chart comparing the advantages of DioxiRinse to those more familiar products. For example, DioxiRinse kills all gram negative bacteria, tastes good, does not stain teeth and reduces bad breath by oxidation.
About DioxiCare
Frontier’s founder, Howard Alliger, invented DioxiCare, the two-part ACTIVE Chlorine Dioxide Delivery System. This novel technology was first patented by Mr. Alliger in 1978 and improved upon thereafter by Frontier. Products like DioxiRinse and DioxiBrite, which incorporate DioxiCare, were perfected and tested over many years.
