Privacy Policy
Our Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us and thank you for entrusting us with your personal information.
The information you provide to Woodcraft is appreciated, and we want to make sure that you know how and when we use this information.
When we collect data about you, we make every effort to ensure that your information is protected and guarded. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available at the bottom of every single page on the website.
After reading our entire Privacy Policy, if you feel that you would like to be removed from any future contact, please know that is your right and you can exercise that right at any time.
In order to remove you from all access point and print/digital marketing material, you will need to provide us with your exact name, email address and/or physical address for unsubscribing from our printed mailings. You can do that by sending us a note or calling us:
Woodcraft Supply, LLC
1-800-535-4482
email:
custserv@woodcraft.com
(If sending us an email, please include your postal mailing address as that will help us ensure faster service.)
We also engage a third-party partner for the purpose of identifying users and delivering to them marketing on our behalf (i.e. email or direct mail). Our partners may collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, and information about your browser or operating system; may combine personal and non-personal information about you with information from other sources; and may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. This activity enables them to identify you to facilitate the delivery of marketing on our behalf. To opt out of recognition services, please go to https://idx.listrakbi.com/opt-out.html. To opt out of third-party cookies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Controlling Our Tracking Tools
Disable browser cookies: Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies, some of which may enable third parties to collect data about your use of our website. You can adjust your browser settings to block all cookies. Certain browsers also allow you to limit the blocking of cookies to specific websites. You will need to adjust the settings on each browser and on each device for which you wish to block cookies. Please note that disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website.
Generally speaking, if you would like to limit mobile device interest-based advertising, you can adjust your advertising preferences on mobile devices through your device settings:
Android Devices: Go to Google Settings > Ads > Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads
iOS Devices: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising (at the bottom of the screen) > Turn on Limit Ad Tracking
When you opt out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still see general audience advertising regarding our products and services.
