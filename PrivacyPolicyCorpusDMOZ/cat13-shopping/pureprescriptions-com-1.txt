Privacy Statement
This statement describes the privacy practices for the PurePrescriptions.com website. PurePrescriptions® is a fully owned subsidiary of Pure Prescriptions, Inc.. PurePrescriptions® is committed to protecting the privacy of our valued customers.
PurePrescriptions® privacy policy notifies you of the information we collect from you during your use of our site, how that information is used, the organizations and people with whom we may share that information and what choices are available to you in regards to the collection, use and distribution of the information. This policy also details the security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under PurePrescriptions’ control, and how you can change, or correct inaccuracies in, your personal information.
Pure Prescriptions, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, other than as described in “Sharing” below.
If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, you should Contact Us.
Information Collected During Registration Process
By registering with PurePrescriptions®, users receive access to our website, including online ordering. We will not sell, share, or rent your information to others, other than as described in “Sharing” below.
Information Collected When You Place an Order
When an order is placed, the user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, other than as described in “Sharing” below.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies are used on our website to save the user time and effort; for example, the use of cookies enables the Remember Me option, which allows the user access to specific information without having to login each time. Cookies can also remember the last page or position you visited, which can be very helpful if you have opened numerous pages of information. If a browser is not set up to accept cookies, users will not be able to use the restricted portion of our site. We do not sell, share or rent any information obtained through the use of cookies.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing
We use a outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
We may also contact you from time to time with promotions, review requests, and voluntary surveys to gather information to better serve you.
Security Technology
This website takes every precaution to protect your information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. When sensitive information (such as a credit card number) is required, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment protected by the latest firewall technology.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, please Contact Us.

Information can be changed, updated or deleted by visiting the My Account section of this website, by emailing us, or by calling us and talking to one of our Customer Service Representatives. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, except as detailed in “Sharing” above.
