Dr. Garber's, LLC, LLC Privacy Policy
It is the policy of Dr. Garber's, LLC, to respect your privacy and the privacy of all visitors to our Web sites. This policy statement has been established to help you understand our commitment to protecting your privacy, and the steps we take to ensure it.
Dr. Garber's, LLC collects certain Personal Information or information that could be used to identify you, such as names, addresses, telephone/fax numbers, or email addresses, when that information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. This information will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned or otherwise disclosed to anyone outside Dr. Garber's, LLC, our service providers, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. We use this information to answer your requests for information or to better understand and respond to your needs. We never share the information collected at drgarbers.com or maxwellpet.com with third parties for their marketing purposes.
Aggregated Information
Dr. Garber's, LLC may use your personal information to generate Aggregated Information that does not allow you to be personally identified or contacted. Aggregated Information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis and may be used by Dr. Garber's, LLC to provide insight on the usage of the services. For example, we might compile personal information in order to determine the percentage of users that live in a particular geographic area.
Tracking Technology ("Cookies")
Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive when you visit a Web site, in order to track use of the site. Some web sites use cookies to collect data regarding the functionality of the site or to help analyze browsing patterns and use of the site.

Security
The Company recognizes that your privacy is important to you. Dr. Garber's, LLC employs security measures, such as those described below, in order to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information under our control.
Technical measures to protect your privacy include, in many instances, the use of passwords and the support of encryption technology in order to ensure the privacy and integrity of your Personal Information, and the secure disposal of Personal Information after it is no longer needed for any business purpose. It is important to recognize, however, that no security measures are perfect, and no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
You should take precautions in choosing the information you send to us via email and in keeping your password confidential. You will be solely responsible for all uses of your password, even if such uses were not authorized by you. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password, you are responsible for contacting us to request deactivation of your password.
