Sales and Privacy Policy
The fine print that keeps you happy and us in business
ReefNet licenses its products to end users under the following licensing policy.
Privacy Statement
Your privacy is very important to us. ReefNet never redistributes customer or newsletter subscriber information, nor is your personal information ever left unsecured. ReefNet's mailing list is reserved for important announcements and is used sparingly. You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time by following these instructions. If you think you have received an email from us in error, contact us
immediately.
Product Availability
ReefNet makes every attempt to maintain accurate stock information within its online store. Products listed as "In stock" usually ship within 24 hours via US Priority Mail (to US customers) or via Canada Post Airmail (to international customers).
Pricing and Purchasing
Please refer to ReefNet's online store for the most up-to-date product pricing. ReefNet reserves the right to change prices at any time. Printed brochures may not display the latest pricing information.
Orders may be placed online, by phone, or by fax.
Returns/Refunds
Due to the nature of the products sold by ReefNet, a strict return/refund policy has been adopted to prevent abuse:
ORIGINAL, SEALED packages may be returned for a refund, excluding shipping costs.
OPENED packages CANNOT be returned for refund under any circumstance. They may be returned for exchange only.
Please be aware of this policy before placing an order. ReefNet provides free demo versions of software where possible, and encourages customers to "try before they buy".
Software sent by email or for which an unlocking code or password is provided is considered "OPENED", and is subject to the above no refund policy.
Warranty
All software products carry a lifetime warranty: should the software be lost or damaged, a replacement will be provided to the registered owner at no charge (excluding shipping). Abuse of this generous policy will not be tolerated.
Hardware products carry a 1 year replacement warranty: should the product fail due to circumstances out of the user's control, a replacement or repair will be provided by ReefNet free of charge during the first year of ownership. After 1 year, replacements may be obtained from ReefNet at reduced prices. Contact ReefNet for replacement costs.
Technical Support
ReefNet offers free sales advice and technical support by phone, fax, and email. Technical support representatives are typically available from 9-5 EST M-F, however there is often someone in the office after hours. We prefer to deal with technical support issues by email.
Refusal of Sale
ReefNet reserves the right to refuse sales of any product to anyone or any organization. We have never had to exercise this right, and hope we never need to.
