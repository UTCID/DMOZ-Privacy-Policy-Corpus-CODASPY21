About Us
Welcome to our Store!
Welcome to Tour King. We have been offering quality accessories for motorcycle riders since 2001, when we opened for business as RideCool.com. In 2013 we acquired the Tour King brand from its founder. At that time, Tour King was almost 20 years old and had established itself as a favorite with riders across the country.
The Tour King cover is known for its great design, quality construction, and durability. Over the years, other products have been introduced with the same desire for quality and durability. All Tour King branded items continue to be made in Texas with quality US made components.
Customer service is of the utmost importance to us so please share with us any questions or concerns about our products. And share your satisfaction with your friends.

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us.
