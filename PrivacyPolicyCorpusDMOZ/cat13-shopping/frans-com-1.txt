By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.
Collection Of Your Personal Information
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("personal information") or allows us to contact you to provide a product or service or carry out a transaction that you have requested. The personal information we collect may include, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, credit card information, physical address, and phone number.
The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the Site. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you have purchased or inquired about. Additionally, we may send you information about other FCL products and services, and/or share information with FCL partners so they may send you information about their products and services.
We may merge Site-visitation data with demographic information, and we may use this information to provide more relevant content. We may combine Site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content.
FCL may hire other companies to provide products or services on our behalf, and we may provide such companies with the personal information they need to perform their duties.
FCL may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on FCL; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of FCL; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of FCL employees or agents, users of FCL products or services, or members of the public.

Use Of Cookies
We may use cookies on this Site to enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard disk by a Web page server. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

We may share such Site statistics with partner companies.
