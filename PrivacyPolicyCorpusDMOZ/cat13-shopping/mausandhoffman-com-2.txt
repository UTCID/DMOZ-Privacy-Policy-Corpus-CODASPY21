Cookie Policy
WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies are small files, containing numbers and letters that are stored on your devices by websites that you visit. Cookies allow websites to recognize you and make your next visit easier and more useful. Used alone, cookies do not personally identify you, but recognize your web browser. There are different types and uses of cookies. Some cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function, while others may be used for performance, functionality, and advertising purposes. Most websites you visit use cookies to improve your user experience by allowing the website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’). Such cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first-party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third-party cookies’).
In most instances, however, cookies are used to provide you with a smooth and functional experience. You can always disable the use of cookies by configuring your browser’s privacy settings (refer to your browser’s settings to learn more about cookie controls). Please note that if you choose to disable the use of cookies entirely, many websites, including ours, will not function properly. For example, if a website does not use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. This means that even after you “log in,” if you navigate to another page, the website will not recognize you and it will not be able to keep you logged in.
HOW WE USE COOKIES
When you use and access the Maus and Hoffman website, we may place a number of cookie files on your web browser. We use cookies on our website to improve your website experiences, assist in your navigation and ability to provide feedback, to analyze trends relating to your use of our products and services, to remember your preferences or settings, to assist with our promotional and marketing efforts and to provide content from third parties. Cookies help us understand how our website is being used and improve your user experience.
We use both session and persistent cookies and different types of first-party and third-party cookies to run the website:
Necessary Cookies
Some Cookies are necessary for our website to function and cannot be turned off. Our website requires the use of these cookies to enable you to navigate the websites, to properly operate or to provide necessary functions relating to the products or services you request. They include, for example, cookies enabling you to securely log into our website, set your preferences, use a shopping cart, or purchase products. Without these cookies we would not be able to identify you when you are logged into our websites, or to otherwise process your online transactions and requests.
Performance/Analytical Cookies
These cookies allow us and our third-party service providers to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us improve how our website works by, for example, ensuring that users can easily find what they need on our website. These cookies generate aggregate statistics that are not associated with an individualized profile. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our website, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
We use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics place a third-party cookie on user’s web browsers that is then used to compile reports of visitor traffic and Internet usage. Google Analytics does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor and only collects aggregate data.
For information on how Google Analytics uses data please visit "How Google uses data when you use our partners sites or apps", located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Functional Cookies
These cookies enable helpful but non-essential website functions that improve your website experience. These cookies allow our website to remember information you have entered or choices you have made such as your username, language, or region. By recognizing you when you return to our website, cookies may, for example, allow us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, or remember your preferences.
Advertising, Tracking or Targeting Cookies
These cookies enable different advertising related functions. They may allow us to record information about your visit to our website, such as pages visited, links followed, and videos viewed so we can make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and Internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
Third Party Cookies
Our website may contain helpful but non-essential features or plug-ins enabling third party services that use cookies, such as social network connectors, maps, advertising networks, or web traffic analysis services. We do not control the third party’s use of those cookies. Please review each party’s cookie disclosure before consenting to this use category.
Our Privacy Policy describes our practices for any personal information that our first-party cookies collect, store, or use.
HOW CAN I CONTROL THE USE OF COOKIES
Some people are uncomfortable with websites storing information on their computer or mobile device, particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party. Although cookies operate in the background and do not generally store your personal information, you may not, for example, want to see advertising that has been targeted to your interests using your browser history. Most web browsers allow you to directly block all cookies, or just third-party cookies, through your browser settings. Remember, using your browser settings to block all cookies, including strictly necessary ones, may interfere with proper website operation.
AMENDMENTS TO THIS COOKIE POLICY
We reserve the right to amend this Cookie Policy at any time. We will post any changes to the way we use cookies on this page. If the changes materially alter how we use cookies, we will post a notice on our website and request your consent for the materially different use. You are free to review your settings or this Cookie Policy at any time.
