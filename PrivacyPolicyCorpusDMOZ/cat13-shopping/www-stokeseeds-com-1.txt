Welcome to the Stokes Seeds website. Please note our site is undergoing some changes. To focus on our key market of commercial vegetable growers, we will be providing the larger package sizes only. We are no longer able to supply seeds in the traditional smaller / home garden package sizes. We have also discontinued Flower seeds in all sizes. Returning Stokes Seeds customers will need to create a new user profile to order from this site. Stay tuned for our great NEW website.
