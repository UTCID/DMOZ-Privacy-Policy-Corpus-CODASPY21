Security of your Personal Information

Discount Ramps also utilizes a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

The digital certificate and seal that you see on our checkout system is from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of Discount Ramps and its Affiliates (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form. Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you signed up for an account at Discount Ramps or its Affiliates (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Discount Ramps will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to "My Account". Log in with your email address and password, then click "Change Email & Password" and enter a new password.
