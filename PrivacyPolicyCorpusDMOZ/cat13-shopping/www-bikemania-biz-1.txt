Covid update
During this challenging time, we are working diligently to provide timely service to our customers.
We are continuing to process orders. But COVID-19 has placed considerable pressure on our staffing levels and tracking numbers and other communications may be delayed.. As most of our staff is working from home, we are temporarily suspending telephone contact - please talk to us via E-mail - while it is taking more time than usual to reply we will get back to you.Also please note that staffing at the various warehouses from which our products are shipped are significantly under staffed. So shipping is taking longer. and UPS and Fedex delivery schedules have been stretched out due to a shortage of drivers. So please be patient – we are responding to all communications as soon as humanly possible. Please stay safe and follow CDC guidelines
