Certain features of the Services, such as certain mobile applications, additional services, promotions, and offers, may be subject to additional terms and conditions (“Additional Terms”) presented in conjunction with them. We may present Additional Terms to you through the Services. Regardless of how they are presented to you, we require that you agree to Additional Terms before using these features of the Services.  Unless otherwise specified in Additional Terms, all Additional Terms are incorporated into these Terms. If you do not agree to Additional Terms, you will not have access to the aspect of the Services to which they relate. These Terms and Additional Terms apply equally.

You agree that we will not be liable to you for any change or discontinuance, in whole or in part, of the Terms, or the Services.
Your continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page each time you access the Services so that you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. You further agree to review these Terms periodically and to make yourself aware of these changes.

Copyright Infringement Notification
Harman follows the guidelines of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act relative to claims that content on our network infringes a copyright. To file a copyright infringement notification with us, you will need to send written communication that includes substantially the following (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3), which is part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to confirm these requirements):
1. Your complete contact information (full name, mailing address, and phone number). Please note that under our Privacy Policy we may provide your contact information and/or the contents of your report to the user who posted the content you are reporting.
2. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
3. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. If such work or works are online, providing links to them will help expedite our review.
4. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. Providing URLs of links to content you claim to be on our network is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
5. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
6. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
7. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
To expedite your notice, please send the notice to:
HARMAN INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED
Attn: HARMAN DMCA Designated Agent Brad Frazer
ADDRESS: P. O. Box 1617, Boise, Idaho 83701-1617
PHONE: 208.388.4875
FAX: 208.954.5216
EMAIL: bfrazer@hawleytroxell.com
Harman reserves the right to permanently and without further notice terminate the account and the concomitant network access of any subscriber who repeatedly violates Harman’s terms of use, copyright policy or both.
Trademark Infringement Notification
Harman makes commercially reasonable efforts to avoid unfair or infringing uses of trademarks on its site.  If you believe your registered trademark or service mark is being infringed on the Harman platform by a third party, you may lodge a complaint following the process below.  Please note that Harman’s policy does not apply to all trademark forms, including without limitation sound, odor, color, and holographic marks, the removal of which Harman will do pursuant to a valid court order.
To make your complaint of trademark misuse, please send the notice to the Harman DMCA Designated Agent set forth above with your claim of trademark infringement and the following information:
1.            The Complainant’s complete name and title
2.            The company, if any, that holds the trademark rights in the mark.
3.            A statement in good faith from you, the Complainant, that the mark infringes your trademark rights;
4.            Your statement, made under penalty of perjury that the information contained in the complaint is accurate, that that you are the owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the trademark rights outlined in your complaint.
5.            A statement that you acknowledge and agree that a copy of this infringement notice, including any contact information provided above, may be provided to the third party Harman site user whose content is the subject of the complaint;
6.            Identifying the mark as it is used on the Harman platform and sufficient information for Harman to identify where it is used on the Harman platform;
7.            Explaining the basis for the claim of infringement including any applicable registration numbers and countries where the mark is registered; and
8.            The Complainant’s contact information,
Please note that you are filing a complaint under penalty of perjury.  Accordingly, you may be liable for damages if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your trademark or service mark.
Once Harman receives a complete trademark infringement notice, we will examine the complaint to determine whether it meets the requisite minimum standards for a complaint, as outlined above, and you will receive a response confirming receipt.  You may also receive a response that the complaint is deficient or one for which this process is unsuitable.
Pursuant to a fully compliant complaint, the information contained in the complaint shall be provided to the party who is the subject of the compliant for response. Harman does not adjudicate claims, including fair use claims, nor does this policy address anything other than ownership of the mark.   In the event the party disputes ownership, the complainant may be required to secure a court order.  Otherwise, Harman may limit, remove, or disable access to the claimed infringing material.
