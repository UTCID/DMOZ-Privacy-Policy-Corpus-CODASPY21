Shield HealthCare routinely gathers data on websites and applications, such as how many people visit the sites, the web pages people visit, where website visitors come from, how long they stay, etc. The data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means that no personally identifiable information is associated with the data. This data helps us improve our content and overall usage. The information is not shared with other organizations for their independent use. The websites do not honor a browser's signal or header request not to track the user's activity.

This may include the device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, the information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your files, and other interactions with the service. We may use your IP address to identify the general geographic area from which you are accessing the website. While an IP address may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address.

Internet Cookies
We may place internet "cookies" on your device to collect information and improve our interactions with you.

A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device. We may use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to our website, such as registering for webinars or checking out on an online store. We may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the service, better understand your interactions with us, and monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our websites. The cookie consists of a unique identifier that does not contain information about you or your health history.

We may partner with a third-party ad network like Google to manage our advertising on other sites.
