By visiting the Site, you are agreeing the terms of our Privacy Policy. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") covers the artrepublic website (the "Site") located at www.artrepublic.com and is part of our Terms of Use Agreement. Please click here to see that Agreement.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Information You Explicitly Provide to Us
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is any information that identifies you personally and would enable someone to contact you directly or describes your relationship with artrepublic. We collect and store Personal Information when you register to use our Site, ask questions, complete a form, tell us your preferences, conduct a transaction or send us an email. Such Personal Information may include your name, address, email address, date of birth, credit card information and other preferences you choose to provide us. When you register, you will also consent to receive email correspondence from us. We will use your Personal Information to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services you request, personalise the Site, allow you to view your past purchases and collections and to notify you of promotions, updates, news or special offers (which may be offered by artrepublic or one of our partners) that we think may be of interest you. If you choose to invite a friend to join artrepublic, you will need to provide us with his or her name and email address and you represent to us that you have their permission to do so. We will store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, tracking the success of our referral program and allowing you to track the success of your referral invitations. Your friend may contact us at hello@artrepublic.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
From time to time we may offer promotions, contests or sweepstakes on our site. If you choose to participate we may collect information including your name, address, age, telephone number, email address or other contact information. We would use this information to notify contest winners, award prizes, monitor site traffic, personalise the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys) and to send participants an email newsletter. We may also request other information some of which may be optional. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company may not be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. Participation is subject to the Official Rules governing that promotion and we encourage you to read such Rules carefully.
During registration and participation in Site promotions, you are required to give truthful contact and demographic information in accordance with our Terms of Use.
By providing your Personal Information to us during your registration and thereafter during use of the Site, you expressly consent to artrepublic's collection, use and storage of such information as stated in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to discontinue non-transactional email correspondence with us at any time, simply follow the instructions to "Unsubscribe" which appear in every email we send, or contact us through the Contact Us page or the email address indicated at the end of this policy.
Information Collected Automatically
Server Statistics.   Like many Web sites, we automatically collect general statistics about our Website traffic and store it in log files in order to track usage and user trends on our site. This information includes hits to our server, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), page views, navigational patterns, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data and the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to administer the Website, to track users' movements around the Website so that we can communicate with our users in the most effective manner and provide them the most useful and desired features, functionality, products and services. In connection with this analysis, artrepublic also uses devices called "web beacons" to help us identify when emails sent to you from us have been received and read. We may also collect IP addresses and other information in order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the Site. When we collect this usage data, we typically only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. When IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information it is to offer customers the best user experience possible. We may also provide this data in aggregate form to partners, Artists and Institutions so that they can understand how often users are seeing their pages and buying their products on our Site.
Cookies.   A cookie is a text file that is assigned by a web server and stored on a user's computer to uniquely identify the browser on a particular computer for record-keeping purposes. artrepublic uses cookies to collect aggregate information about site usage, help identify users when they return to our site, track navigational patterns of usage and access user preferences. We do so to enhance the quality of your visit to our Site, access your preferences and personalise the Site for you. artrepublic uses "session" or temporary cookies to ensure that you are recognised when you move from page to page on the site and that any information you enter on the Site (for example, items in your shopping cart) are not lost as you navigate the site. We also use persistent cookies so we can remember you on subsequent visits to our Site, which enables us to provide a more enhanced, efficient and personal experience when you return to our Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site. If you do not want to have cookies placed on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse or remove cookies by following the instructions in your browser's "help" file. However, doing so will limit system performance, may not allow you to take advantage of certain features on our Site and even cause certain features of the Site to malfunction. We may permit limited third parties to place cookies through the Site to provide us with better insights into the use of the Site, user demographics, or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a consumer's online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Site.
