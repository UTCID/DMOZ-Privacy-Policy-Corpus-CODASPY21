Privacy statement.
Wakes Waxes is a
partnership of myself (Barry Moulton), my wife (Pam Moulton) and my
daughter (Liz Moulton).
I’m the one who does
almost everything so I’ll write the following in the first person…
I am the data controller
for Wakes Waxes.
I hold a few details
about my customers – these are details that are needed to process
orders/enquiries from those contacts.  I have never and never
will pass on or sell personal details to other companies.
I keep records of
purchases to deal with your orders/enquiries efficiently and
for accounting purposes.  The details that I have on
a computerised system are your Name & address plus phone
numbers and email address if you’ve made those
available.
If you pay by
card, I have to record your numbers on paper ( not on any computer) as
I’m not set up to process card payments immediately.  After
the transaction is complete, to comply with card-proessing
requirements, I then  shred & incinerate
that paper  record of your card details.
You can ask me to destroy
your whole account details at any time by ringing me on 01787 227320 or
sending me an email to barry@waxes.co.uk
.
I don’t send marketing
emails ; I’ll only contact you if necessary or if you have asked me so
to do.
