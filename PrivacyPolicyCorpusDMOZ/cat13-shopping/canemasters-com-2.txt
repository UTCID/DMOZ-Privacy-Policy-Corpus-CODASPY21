All Cane Masters products should be used only in the manner for which they were designed.  The primary use of canes and walking sticks is mobility.  However, in situations where you feel that your life is at risk, Cane Masters’ products may also be used for personal protection.
Cane Masters products should be used for personal protection only if the user reasonably feels that his/her life is in danger, and it is not possible to retreat safely.   Cane Masters LLC products should never be used for the purpose of causing injury or bodily harm. Strikes to the head, throat, spine, groin, chest, and elsewhere may be fatal or cause severe injury, and should be avoided.   Instead, the objective if attacked, is to incapacitate the attacker using the minimum (proportional) force necessary to allow the user to withdraw to a place of safety and contact the authorities.
