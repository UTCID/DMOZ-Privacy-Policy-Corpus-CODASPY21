2. Availability
Goods are subject to availability.  Our acceptance of your offer to purchase our goods is subject to their availability. Our acknowledgement of order acceptance via the web or email is not a guarantee of delivery. If we are unable to deliver the goods which you have offered to purchase we will let you know as quickly as possible and a full refund will be given. Orders over £400 will automatically be reviewed to ensure orders are for personal consumption and that delivery is viable.
Orders that include sale items may be sent incomplete if certain sale lines are out of stock. Your payment will be refunded and you will be notified as above.

3. Purchase for Non-Domestic Use

4. Pricing, Description and Product Information
The prices which you must pay for the products that you order are set out on the website at the time you place your order (plus a delivery charge) except where we discover an error in the price of the products you have ordered. In this event, we will inform you as soon as possible after receiving your order and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it.

Although we will take all reasonable care to ensure that all descriptions, details and prices of products appearing on the website are correct at the time when the information was inputted onto the system, the information appearing on this website at any time may not reflect the exact position at the moment you place an order.

19. WEE Regulations
Since 1 July 2007 the UK's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive has been law. The legislation aims to make producers pay for the collection, treatment and recovery of waste electrical equipment. The regulations also mean that suppliers of equipment like high street shops and internet retailers must allow consumers to return their waste equipment free of charge.
Whittard of Chelsea fully supports this legislation and offers our customers free take-back of their WEEE items on a like-for-like basis when they buy a new Electrical or Electronic product from us. Please note that the WEEE item must be returned within 28 days of purchasing the new item.
For example, if you buy a coffee machine in one of our stores we would accept an old coffee machine in return and prevent it going into a landfill site by disposing of it safely.
If you make a purchase of an electrical or electronic item on our website you are entitled to return your old 'like for like' item to any of our nationwide store network. Use the Store Locator to find your nearest store.
In this instance please bring proof of your web purchase so we can dispose of the old item safely.
