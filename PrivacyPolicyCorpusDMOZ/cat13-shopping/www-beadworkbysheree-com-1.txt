encryption (Star Wars Strength Encryption) of your information and provides
state-of-the-art security for online merchants and consumers. You may browse

I invested in this level of security to provide a safe and secure shopping

information such as your name, address, and credit card number will be kept safe
throughout your entire shopping experience at BeadworkbySheree.
Along with Secure Online Credit Card payment you
may also pay by either Money Order or PayPal.   On orders with several
items the PayPal system will truncate item details.  I pass all the
information to the PayPal system, it has a length limitation and cuts off the
message.  PayPal will have the correct Total amount but the confirmation
email from PayPal will not list all the details.  In this case you will
receive a second Order confirmation email from BeadworkbySheree with a copy of
your Invoice showing all the information.
