Prices on our website can also be displayed in alternative currencies. Whilst these values are updated in real time to reflect the prevailing mid-market exchange rate, customers are advised that these (non GBP £) prices should be used as a guideline only, as we cannot guarantee the exchange rate that your card issuer will apply when processing your payment. The card issuer will almost inevitably apply a less preferential exchange rate and, in some cases, may levy an additional surcharge for purchases made in a foreign currency. We advise that customers contact their card issuer for clarification of their exchange rates and policies.AvailabilityReceipt of your order does not guarantee that we can supply the selected Products to you. All the products are subject to availability and we must therefore reserve the right in exceptional circumstances: to limit quantities of products we supply; to supply only part of an order or to divide up orders; to alter the availability and duration of, and to terminate at any time, any special offers.
