You’re going to love it.
We make sure of it.
Let’s face it. You’re not going to get that I love my closet feeling if anything about the process is hard. So, we make it easy. From your free in-home consultation to finished installation, our team takes care of every detail so you can relax.
Remodeling doesn’t have to be hard.
In fact, we believe it should be exciting and fun.
Our Process
"It’s so great to work with a company that you can wholeheartedly recommend. There were no surprises ~ it was fantastic, and I’m really happy!"

Walk-in closet remodel.
"We wanted closets that reflect our casual lifestyle, practical and nice. And that’s what Inspired Closets delivered to us. When you hire a company like Inspired Closets, you can just weigh in with what you like and they take care of the rest. The spaces we had to work with are unique with lots of angles. Even with our unusual layout, we wanted to maximize our efficiency. What’s neat about our daughter’s closet is that it works for her today as an infant and it will work for her as a toddler and a teenager too. That flexibility is really great!"

Wondering what our customers think?
“I can’t believe we have so much room! And there’s even room to grow in a space that wasn’t that big to begin with. I love my Inspired Closet.”
Play Nicki’s Story
Walk-in closet remodel.
"Our designer came to the house and worked with us to create a large enough closet that has a side for my husband and a side for me. The installation process only took about four hours. It was so simple and non-invasive before we knew it, they were done. And now we have this beautiful closet that is exactly what we were looking for."

Meet our Team
Our joy comes from your joy.
Our philosophy is quite simple: Always do what we say we're going to do. We believe that's why so many clients are happy to share positive reviews and refer us to family and friends. We want you to be confident in your decision to choose us, which is why we share our awards and accolades with you.
We calm the chaos.
When our home is disorganized, our lives feel chaotic. Laundry rooms buried under clothes and garages cluttered with boxes, bikes, and outdoor toys often cause stress and frustration. The Inspired Closets Brookfield team can help. We specialize in designing custom closets for Brookfield, CT residents, but we can also create custom solutions for any room in the home. Our smart designs work with you to simplify your life.
Garage
When your garage is so messy that you can’t park the car inside, it seems impossible to imagine ever getting it organized. We can help you reimagine your space. With sliding door cabinets, custom slatwall, and overhead storage, you’ll have space for your toys, tools and cars in your garage.

Mudroom & Entryway
You don't have to settle for a mountain of shoes and piles of jackets stacked on a single coat hook in your entryway. There’s a better way to organize your space, and it includes custom lockers, ample key and coat hooks, and enough entryway shoe storage for everyone in the family.

Laundry
The secret to making laundry day a little easier is to have a laundry room that works smart with style. Built-in hampers and a folding counter can go a long way toward transforming the way you tackle your laundry. And when the space is filled with beautiful custom cabinets and a clean color palette, the whole space has a calming effect.

Kitchen Pantry
Adding a few simple storage solutions for meal prep, appliances, and food can transform the way you use your kitchen. With everything tucked away but still easy to grab, the morning rush for breakfast or quick meals for dinner becomes much more manageable.

Home Office
Nestle into your comfortable work zone and take care of business. Our custom home office designs help you feel relaxed and motivated at the same time. Clever features, like a hideaway laptop tray or built-in desk outlets, optimize your space for efficiency, while wall and desk organizers keep everything in its place.

Murphy Beds
Whether you host guests often or you’d just like the option to do so, a Murphy bed is an invaluable piece of furniture. With it, any room in the home can become a temporary spare bedroom. Pull the bed out from the wall when visitors arrive and tuck it back in when they leave. There’s no better way to make room for visitors.
