At Dunham’s, we understand users of the site need to control their personal information, which may include but
not be limited to name, address, phone number(s), e-mail address and other personal identifying
information.  Dunham’s does not sell, rent, swap or trade any of this information to third parties.
Dunham’s does provide some of its services through arrangements with affiliates, service providers and similar
third parties.  Dunham’s and such parties may use such personal information to operate Dunham’s site and
deliver Dunham’s services.  For example, Dunham’s must provide your e-mail address to the service provider
that allows us to send you special offers and services you may have chosen to receive.  Dunham’s will also
disclose any information as may be required or otherwise justified under federal, state or local laws and

Types of Information Collected and Collection Methods
In order to better meet your diverse needs, Dunham’s will collect various pieces of information to facilitate
and enhance your use of this site.  Information collected may include personally identifiable information
you choose to provide us.  By engaging in certain activities on the site, Dunham’s may ask you to provide
certain information, including but not limited to name, address, phone number(s), e-mail address and other
personal identifying information.  This information may be collected at those times when you fill out and
submit an on-line form, register your e-mail for special offers and services, enter a contest or sweepstakes,
sign up for Dunham’s Team Program, participate in Dunham’s blog community and other activities that may be
available on the site from time to time.  Depending on the site activity, some of the information
collected may be identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.  If you choose not to provide the
mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Certain
aspects of Dunham’s site invoke a standard feature found in browser software called “cookies.”  A cookie
is a small data file, which a web site stores on your electronic data storage device (if your web browser
permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us.  Cookies enhance your use of the site, allow
the site to operate more effectively and assist us in the maintenance of a secure site.  The information
collected may also include information such as the website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) from which you
just came, the URL to which you go, what browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
If your browser permits you to do so, you may decline our cookies, but some parts of the site may not operate
properly with such a choice. Cookies, Web beacons or tags may be used for interest based third-party
advertisements in which case non-personally identifiable information may be collected. This information may be
used regarding visits to our websites and other websites. The information collected and used by this process is
always anonymous and does not enable any third-party to identify you individually.
We may ask you for Location Information to help us offer you coupons, store location and promos/sweepstakes
specifically nearby. If you have allowed this setting on your mobile device, this information is collected and
used only for Dunham’s services. For example, when sharing your location services, we may be able to detect the
nearest Dunham’s store along with the corresponding store promos and deals. You may turn off the location
services and mobile notifications via your phone settings.  Dunham’s will not disclose any information
regarding location services. For the Dunham’s mobile app, your e-mail address is collected and used for login
and account information only.  You can delete the app at any time from your mobile device.
Additionally, at any time you can change the settings within the Dunham’s mobile app, or within your mobile
phone, to disallow push notifications to be sent from the Dunham’s mobile app.
E-Mail
Upon registering your e-mail address with this site, you will from time to time receive e-mail updates, special
offers, notices, invitations, product announcements or other such information from Dunham’s.  At any time,
you can choose to remove your name from our e-mail list by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in
the email.
Data Security
Dunham’s has secured the information it collects with certain physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to
prevent unauthorized access to the information, as well as to maintain the integrity of the information.
However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed 100% secure.
While we strive to protect your information, you acknowledge (a) there are security and privacy limitations on
the Internet beyond our control, (b) the security, integrity and privacy of information exchanged between you
and us through this site cannot be guaranteed, and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered
with in transit by a third party.
Children’s Privacy
Dunham’s understands how important it is to protect the privacy of children. Therefore, Dunham’s does not
knowingly collect personal information from children, and no part of its website is intended to solicit or
collect such information from children.
Links to Other Sites
Dunham’s sites may include links to other web sites with privacy policies Dunham’s doesn’t control.  Once
you leave our site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the web site you
are visiting, which may differ from Dunham’s.  Dunham’s is not responsible for the privacy practices or
content of such web sites.
Updating and Correcting Your Information
You may request to update and/or correct your information by contacting us at the “Contact Us” link at
dunhamssports.com.  Please include your name, address and e-mail when you contact us.  You may
request to have your information removed; however, past transactions and communications cannot be
deleted.  In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual
information remaining on backup storage media.
Blog Community
Dunham’s blog community may be monitored.  Statements or exchanges considered antagonistic, obscene,
libelous, defamatory, harassing, discriminatory or otherwise inappropriate by blog administrators may not be
posted or may be deleted, as such statements or exchanges do not contribute to the environment of discussion
the blog community aspires to create. You also acknowledge that postings in the blog community may be viewed by
all visitors to the site; consequently, you have no expectation of privacy with regard to such postings.
Privacy Policy Updates
As Dunham’s site grows and technology improves, Dunham’s Privacy Policy will be updated on the site.
Please review the policy frequently for updates and changes.  You will be deemed to have agreed with any
such updates or changes by your continued use of the site.
Online Information
The information contained on the Dunham’s Sports website (Dunhams.com)
is intended to generally inform customers of our product offering at our store locations.  Although we
intend for the information to be accurate and current, typographical errors, pricing errors, seasonal changes
and regional differences may exist leading to details that may be inaccurate, incomplete or dated.  As
such, products may be unavailable, may have different attributes, or may carry a different price.
Dunham’s reserved the right to refuse or cancel orders at our store locations if a product is listed at the
incorrect price.  Additionally, we reserve the right to make product changes (features, pricing, content
etc.) at any time without notice.
Consumer Protection
Dunham’s Sports does occasionally sponsor/promote contests and sweepstakes.  These may involve e-mail,
social media, text message campaigns, etc.   At any time, however, please be aware that there are
scams and non-legitimate contests, sweepstakes or surveys that may spoof retailers not in any way affiliated
with the retailer (including Dunham’s Sports).  As a result, please feel free to bring
to our attention any communication that does not appear to be legitimate from Dunham’s Sports.
