At Airborne Athletics, we value your business and are committed to protecting your privacy. We want your experience here to be positive and safe.
You may browse our site at any time without logging in and you will remain anonymous. We may track I.P. addresses in order to see which pages are being used, but we will not know who you are. Your log-on information will be used only by you for site customization, and your visits will always remain confidential.
We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.
