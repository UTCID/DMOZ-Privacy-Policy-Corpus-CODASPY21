Credit Cards:
Your advance order allows us to make commitments to our perennial nurseries and Dutch bulb growers.
As has been traditional in the mail-order bulb business for many years, your credit card is charged when you place your order through our secure servers.
This allows us to accurately project inventory, and we reward you with significant discounts on our products.
We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
Gift Certificates:
You may purchase Gift Certificates in any amount of cash. If you need help, just call.
Gifts of Advance Sale Bulbs and Perennials:
You may choose an Advance Sale gift for the recipient--and receive great sale prices in our advance sales of spring bulbs and perennials. If your certificate is for bulbs or perennials that will arrive in Spring, please call Customer Service tollfree at 877 270-5187, ext. 10, and we'll be happy to fill out a beautiful Gift Certificate with the "gift to come" information, and send the certificate to you or to the recipient. If you'd like a free greeting card enclosed, please just give us that information in the Comment space on your order.
