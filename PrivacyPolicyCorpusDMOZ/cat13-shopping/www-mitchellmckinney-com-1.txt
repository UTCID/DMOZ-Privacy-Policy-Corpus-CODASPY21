Upon Receipt of a Bona Fide Infringement Notification. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is received by the Designated Agent, it is Company’s policy: 1. to remove or disable access to the infringing material; 2. to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and 3. that for repeat offenders, Company will also terminate such content provider's, member's
or user's access to the service.
Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.

The content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
Removal.
