Identification Information
We may collect
personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including,
but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, place an
order, subscribe to the newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and
in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make
available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address,
mailing address, phone number, and credit card information. Users may, however,
visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information
from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can
always refuse to supply personally identifying information, except that it may
prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.

our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name,
IP address, search query, type of computer and technical information about

Web
Browser Cookies
X10.com and our marketing agencies use Google Analytics and
Clicky Analytics to collect the following information when users access or
interact with our Website: This information may include, among other
information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or
advertisement that referred you to our Website, the search terms you entered
into a search engine that led you to our Website, areas within our Website that
you visited, and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate
with websites. This information may also include x/y coordinates of mouse
events, unique ID tracking cookie, Internet Protocol ("IP") address
(anonymized for residents of the European Economic Area), unique device identifier
("Device Identifier") for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet,
etc.). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or
connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify
your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also
provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the
physical location of the device used to access the Service.
The X10.com Site may use "cookies" to enhance User
experience. The User's web browser places cookies on their device for
record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. The User
may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert the User
when cookies are being sent. If a User does so, note that some parts of our
Site may not function properly. We use cookies and other technologies to make
sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our services. We use
cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our Site, to make
our Site more usable as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer
communications.
X10.com and our marketing agencies use the information from
Google Analytics and Clicky Analytics in order to assemble statistics regarding
usage of our Website as well as to help us understand how users engage with our
Website on an individual and aggregate basis in order to improve it; to help
with customer service needs (such as troubleshooting issues that users report
to us); and for research and analytical purposes such as service performance;
customer behavior and common navigation through the X10.com Website. Google
Analytics data is then fed into our Google AdWords account in order to help us
monitor how our internet advertising is performing.

How
We Protect Your Information
We adopt appropriate
data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to
protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of
your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data
stored on our Site.
Sensitive and private
data exchange between the Site and its Users happens over an SSL secured
communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
Our Site, powered by Magento, is also in compliance with PCI vulnerability
standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users.
Sharing
Your Personal Information
We do not sell, trade,
or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may share
generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal
identification information regarding visitors and users with our business
partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
From time to time, we may use agents or contractors who will have access to
your personal information to perform services for us (such as database/website
maintenance & marketing); however, they are required by us to keep the
information confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry
out the services for X10.com. We may use third party service providers to help
us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf,
such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with
these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us
your permission.
Internet
Advertising

Remarketing to advertise X10.com across the Internet. AdWords remarketing will
display relevant ads tailored to you based on what parts of the X10.com website you
have viewed by placing a cookie on your machine. This cookie does not identify
you or give Google or us access to your computer. The cookie essentially
states, “This User visited this web page, so show this User ads related to that
webpage.” Google AdWords Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to
better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to each User.

Party Websites
Users may find
advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of
our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third
parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and
are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from
our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and

privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any
other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to
that website's own terms and policies.

site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
send you an online advertisement and to compile non personal identification

ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the
use of cookies by any advertisers.

maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and
no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
