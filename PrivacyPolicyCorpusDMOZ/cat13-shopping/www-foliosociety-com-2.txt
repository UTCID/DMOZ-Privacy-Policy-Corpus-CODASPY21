Our core service providers include the delivery companies we use to send our books to you; banks and clearing houses to process your payments; our warehousing and despatch company; IT service providers; our provider of independent product and service reviews; and the company which handles some of our orders by telephone.  It also includes companies to help us with our marketing, including catalogue printers and mailing houses, our advertising agencies, email marketing provider and data analytics companies.  These companies help us ensure that our marketing communications are relevant, not duplicated and abide by your marketing preferences.With other partners when your marketing preferences allow usWe work with a number of other third party companies to provide value to our business and to you. These companies include our trusted marketing and social media partners (for instance you can publish a link on Facebook or Twitter to any books of ours that you have enjoyed).We will only partner with a company that meets our own high standards and that we think is a good fit for our business and our customers.

The companies we share your data with directly and the retailers participating in these alliances are active in the publishing, clothing, collectables, food & wine, gardening, gadgets & entertainment, health & beauty, household goods, and home interiors categories. The alliances work by each trusted retailer sharing information on what their customers buy. This information is analysed to help the retailers understand consumers’ wider buying patterns.

In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, personal data which we hold about you may be one of the transferred assets.In aggregated formatStrictly speaking this is not personal data, but on occasions we will use data from which you cannot be personally identified but which does include information that relates to you (such as your purchase history).

We would have to disclose your personal data where we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the regulator or crime enforcement agency's demand.
When we think it is reasonably necessary to protect you or us
Occasionally businesses are subject to attempted criminal activities; this can affect both us and you. We will take all reasonable steps to protect you and our business but sometimes we may need to share your personal data where we think it is reasonably necessary to:
Detect, monitor, investigate or prevent any suspected illegal activities, fraud or security issues
Enforce our terms and conditions and to protect your and our rights and property
Investigate and defend any third party claims or allegations
As part of a business sale or purchase, merger or reorganisation
Although we have no current plans to do so, from time to time we may look to purchase another business or sell or re-organise parts of our business to ensure that we remain in strong shape. Sometimes these types of corporate transactions involve the transfer of your personal data solely for the purposes of assessing the transaction. In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, personal data which we hold about you may be one of the transferred assets.
In aggregated format
Strictly speaking this is not personal data, but on occasions we will use data from which you cannot be personally identified but which does include information that relates to you (such as your purchase history). This data is combined with data from other customers to provide general trends on customers’ preferences, ratings and reviews and general buying habits.Do we send your personal data outside the European Economic Area?From time to time we may use service providers outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), in particular for the provision of IT services.
If we do share your personal data with service providers outside the EEA we will ensure reasonable safeguards are put in place to protect your personal data.How long do we keep your personal data for?We will not keep your personal data for longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this policy.  At the end of the retention period, your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.
As a guide:
we will keep personal data while your online account is active
we will keep personal and sales data while there is still a reasonable expectation that you will respond to our sales and marketing communications but never longer than ten years after your last communication with us
we may keep certain categories of personal data after your account is closed in order to meet any legal or regulatory requirements, or to resolve a legal dispute.  For example, we may need to keep certain personal data relating to your purchases in order to comply with authorities’ sales tax or VAT reporting requirements
Your rightsYou have a number of rights under data protection laws.  These are summarised below.
the right to be informed
We need to be clear with you about how we process your personal data. We do this through this Privacy Policy, which we will keep up to date and available on our website.
the right of access
You have the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you.  You can do this by contacting us at +44 (0) 207 400 4200 or datacontroller@foliosociety.com or by writing to Data Controller, The Folio Society, Clove Building, 4 Maguire Street, London SE1 2NQ. To process your request, we will ask you to provide us with proof of identity so that we can be sure we are releasing your personal data to the right person.
We will process your request within one month or, if the request is particularly complex, three months. We can provide you with a copy of your personal data in electronic format or hard copy.  If you would like additional copies, we will charge a fee to cover the administrative cost.
If we consider the frequency of your requests is unreasonable or the request is unfounded, we may refuse to comply with your request. Alternatively, we can provide the information but will charge a fee to cover the administrative cost.
the right to correction
We welcome feedback from you to ensure our records are as accurate and up-to-date as possible. If you think that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete please ask us to correct it by contacting us at +44 (0) 207 400 4200 or datacontroller@foliosociety.com or by writing to Data Controller, The Folio Society, Clove Building, 4 Maguire Street, London SE1 2NQ.  We will process your request as soon as we receive it or within one month of receipt at the latest.
the right to erasure
You can ask us to delete your personal data.  However, in some circumstances we can refuse to erase personal data which we need to keep (i) to comply with a legal obligation (for instance, in the UK we are required by HMRC to keep certain personal data for up to 6 years for VAT reporting purposes); and (ii) in relation to the exercise or defence of any legal claims.
When you ask us to delete your personal data, we assume that you do not want to hear from us again. To ensure that we do not send you any special offers in the future, we will retain just enough of your personal data solely for suppression purposes.
Other than as described above, we will always comply with your request and do so promptly. We would also notify any third parties with whom we have shared your personal data about your request so that they also comply.
Some customers would still like to order our products but do not want to receive any marketing communications from us. This is not a problem as you can simply update your marketing preferences by contacting us at +44 (0) 207 400 4200 or datacontroller@foliosociety.com or by writing to Data Controller, The Folio Society, Clove Building, 4 Maguire Street, London SE1 2NQ.  Alternatively, you can update your preferences at any time through the Preference Centre if you have an online account.
the right to object
If you would like us to stop processing your personal data for marketing purposes simply let us know by contacting us at +44 (0) 207 400 4200 or datacontroller@foliosociety.com or by writing to Data Controller, The Folio Society, Clove Building, 4 Maguire Street, London SE1 2NQ.  Alternatively, you can update your preferences at any time through the Preference Centre if you have an online account.
If you are not satisfied with any aspect of our handling of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in the UK, or your local data protection authority.UpdateWe keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and will place any update on this web page.
