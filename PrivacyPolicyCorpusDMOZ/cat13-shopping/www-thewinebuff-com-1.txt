Site Map
By using our website and buying wine from us you are agreeing to our Terms & Conditions as set out below.
These terms were last updated 25 May 2015
PROVISION OF WEB SITE SERVICE
The Site is owned and operated by The Wine Buff Holdings Ltd. (Company No: 358167), whose registered office is at 5 Pery Square, Limerick, Ireland.
General Email: info@thewinebuff.com
Office Telephone: +353 61 423 904
AGE RESTRICTION
It is our policy to not sell alcohol to anyone under the age of eighteen in accordance with the law. By registering or placing an order with us you are confirming you are over eighteen. If the wine you purchase is a gift then the recipient must also be over eighteen.
Upon delivery, if our couriers are in doubt of the age of the recipient of an order they are required to request proof of age.  In the event that this is not satisfied they are not permitted to leave the wine.
customer registration
It is your responsibility to ensure that changes in your personal details are updated immediately.
The Wine Buff reserves the right to decline your registration.
The Wine Buff reserves the right to suspend or cancel your registration.
The suspension or cancellation of your registration, and your right to use the Company website shall not affect either party’s statutory rights.
WINE PRICING & AVAILABILITY
All prices on our website are quoted in euro € and include VAT applicable in Ireland.
Whilst we work hard to ensure the details and pricing on our website to be accurate, occasionally errors may occur. Please note, the bottle in the image displayed for any wine may vary from the one received due to a change in vintage, bottle type or labeling design. The actual wine will always be as described however, including vintage, unless we inform you otherwise.
We sources our wines directly from the vineyards and in most cases from smaller natural wine makers. We do our best to avoid stock out situations, but it can happen, when wine becomes unavailable due to shortage in the vineyard or vintage change. In the event that you have ordered a wine that we are short of we will contact you to ask would you like to choose something else or wait until the wine becomes available.
If you have ordered a product that is incorrectly described or priced, we will contact you prior to delivery to advise you of the correct details. You may wish to cancel your order if you are unhappy receiving the product with the corrected description and price. We reserve the right to change prices at any time.
DELIVERY
The Wine Buff offer a delivery service in the Republic of Ireland only, please contact us directly if you need shipment made to the UK.
Our delivery charges are €8.00 flat rate delivery to each address. If you wish to make multiple deliveries to different addresses then each address will be regarded as one drop.  Orders over €100 are free of charge for delivery.
Your order will normally arrive within 3 days. However, due to COVID 19 and the current volumes of deliveries in Ireland, this may take longer. We use an independent courier to deliver your order and they will contact you to arrange delivery. Deliveries do not take place on weekends or bank holidays, operating only Monday to Friday.
Failure to deliver your order will result in your order being returned to us. We will then contact you to re-arrange delivery, or cancellation of the order. Failure to make delivery a second time will result in the cancellation of your order.
Please note we are unable to arrange for the courier to deliver wine outside business hours. If you think you (or the recipient) won't be home to accept your wine, you can choose to have it delivered to a business address or dropped at a safe location at your home. It is mandatory that a contact number is provided for all delivery addresses.
cancellation
You can cancel your order at any stage up to the point of dispatch and within seven days of receiving your wine order.
If your wine should not arrive in reasonable condition you should notify us as soon as possible. If the wine is visibly damaged on delivery you should refuse delivery and request that the wine is returned to us, Damaged product, or wine suffering from ‘cork taint’, will be replaced or refunded immediately. This will not affect your statutory rights.
Should you be unhappy with any aspect of your order, we will collect all or part of your order for free and provide a full refund within thirty days, provided the goods remain in a saleable condition. Goods received should be inspected immediately upon receipt to check for damaged or missing products. Failure to notify us of damaged or missing product within seven days of receiving the order may negate your right to free return and refund.
