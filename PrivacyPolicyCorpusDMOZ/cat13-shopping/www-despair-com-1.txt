Privacy Policy
Despair, Inc.® respects your privacy/buying power.
Despair, Inc.® does not rent or sell personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies. Frankly, most of our customers aren't exactly the kinds of people you want to share with others. Despair, Inc.® does, however, share information with various third-party companies that it hires to perform certain services on Despair's behalf. Despair, Inc.® does not authorize these vendors to share your personal information with anyone, apart from those required to perform their respective contracted services. These services include, but may not be limited to, the following:
Fulfillment:
To further eliminate non-Executive jobs at Despair, Inc.®, we have contracted out order fulfillment to a different company who picks, packs and ships customer orders.
Shipping:
Name and address data are made available to shippers to enable them to deliver customers' purchases.
Email List Management:
Despair, Inc.® contracts with a list management service to administer its Wailing List™.
Printing:
Despair, Inc.® periodically mails catalogs or other materials current and potential future customers. Therefore, Despair, Inc.® must share name and address data with the printer.
Catalog list administration:
Despair, Inc.® occasionally purchases the names and addresses of people from less scrupulous retailers than ourselves. This process requires that we share the name and address data of those who have asked to have our catalogs sent to them to identify duplicates. The catalog list administration is not allowed to share our customer list with any other of their clients.
In addition to the above, Despair, Inc.® may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide customer information to governmental authorities. We will disclose customer information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. Despair, Inc.® fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities (e.g. the fraudulent use of the Despair Frownie logo in email exchanges). We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities (e.g. credit card fraud) that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
