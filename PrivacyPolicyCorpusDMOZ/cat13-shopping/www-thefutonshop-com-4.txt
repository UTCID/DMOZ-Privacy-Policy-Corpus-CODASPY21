SHIPPING POLICY Back To Top
Please inspect your all product(s) and note any damage at time of delivery on your delivery receipt.
Policy - Shipping
HOW WILL MY ORDER SHIP?
We use the fastest, safest, and most reliable carrier to ship your products to you. We have long term partnerships with some of the best residential shipping companies nationwide. Everything we sell is hand packaged and then we select the best shipping method in order to provide you fast secure delivery to your home. When we ship every order we notify you via the email address provided to us on your order. This email will state the freight company we shipped with and the tracking number of your products. We also send you the phone number and web site of the freight company so you can track your order. These freight companies provide you with an estimated date of arrival. The shipping companies will contact you to set up an appointment. Be sure to contact us if anything seems unusual with the progress of the shipment. We have two methods of shipment available: Small Parcel or Truck Freight.
Small Parcel
Whenever possible we will ship smaller, lighter items via FEDEX. FedEx provides fast and reliable shipping available for many small items we sell. It will ship directly to your home. Depending on how close you are to the distribution area of FedEx, your item should arrive between 2 and 7 business days after it leaves our warehouse. We do require a signature on all shipments.
Truck Freight - Curb Side Delivery
Many items we sell are too large or too heavy to ship using a Small Parcel carrier. Therefore, our best option is to ship it to you using a LTL common carrier. Truck freight is different than standard FedEx or US Mail in that you will be responsible for carrying the product from the curb into your house. Truck Freight also differs from Small Parcel in that, for residential deliveries, the shipping carrier to schedule a delivery appointment will contact you. Most companies offer appointment windows (usually 2-4 hours) between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday. You will work directly with the delivery company to arrange a convenient delivery time and date.
The most important thing to remember is to inspect the package thoroughly at the time of delivery. If the box has any damage, of any kind or if there is any reason for you to be at all concerned about damage, please write "PRODUCT DAMAGED" clearly on the sheet that they ask you to sign. This simply insures that if there is any damage, it will be easy to take care of the problem.
If you are ordering a very large item, please keep in mind that you may need a couple of people to help unload it. Alternatively, most truck freight companies offer additional services to help you move items from the truck into your house. Once we email you the tracking information you can contact the shipper directly to inquire about additional services. You would be responsible for directly paying the truck freight carrier for any additional services.
WHEN WILL MY ORDER ARRIVE?
Once your order is placed it takes 3 business days to process the order, inspect the product and prepare your order for release. For Small Parcel shipments, delivery usually takes between 2 and 7 business days after your order is released from the warehouse. Please call us if you have any questions or concerns. For Truck Freight shipments, delivery usually takes between 7 and 12 days from when your order ships. For residential deliveries, you will be contacted for an appointment as soon as your order arrives at the local terminal. For commercial deliveries, no appointment will be made. If you need to make one, please contact us. Rush order or expedited shipping is available to most areas. Please contact our customer service department for a quote at CustomerService@TheFutonShop.com Monday through Friday.
SHIPPING CHARGES AND FREE SHIPPING?
In order to keep your cost down and our pricing simple, we either provide Free Shipping or, in some cases, we charge shipping per item. The charges, if any are indicated upon check out. If you have purchased an item that say shipping included or free shipping, no additional charges will occur, unless you have added other items to the order. Shipping charges are non-refundable.

Avoid using oil/thinner based furniture cleaners. Use water based cleaners or a damp cloth only.
Articles such as glasses, bookends, flowerpots and hot cups and dishes should have a cloth or felt type pads pm them. Beware of some felt pads that have a pre-glued side as some of these adhesives contain chemicals that can damage the finish.
