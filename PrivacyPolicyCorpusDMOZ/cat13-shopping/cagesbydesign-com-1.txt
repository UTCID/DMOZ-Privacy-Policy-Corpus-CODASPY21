Billing for services;
Creating directories (only when you explicitly ask to be included);
Responding to customer service requests, questions and concerns; and

If you provide your information in order to be included in our free directories you are consenting to (1) individuals contacting you to solicit your products and services and (2) businesses contacting you to market services you may find useful. Due to the nature of a directory, your information will be published publicly and you may be contacted by phone or EMAIL depending on the information you provide. You will never be added to our directories unless you request to be included and you may remove your listing at any time by calling (920) 886-1220 or sending us an EMAIL.
