GIFT CARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These terms and conditions apply to all Sneakerhead Gift Cards (“Gift Cards”). By purchasing, using, or accepting Gift Cards you accept these terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”). Devicom International, Inc., doing business as Sneakerhead.com (“Sneakerhead.com”), reserves the right to interpret, modify, or terminate the Terms and Conditions with or without notice. The most recent Terms and Conditions will always be posted on the Sneakerhead.com website at www.sneakerhead.com. Gift Cards may not be redeemed for cash unless otherwise required by law.
Payment
You may use a Gift Card to pay for the full value or part of the value of your selected item(s). If your purchase online is not completely covered by the balance of your Gift Card, you must use an accepted alternate form of payment to complete the purchase. Any unused balance of the underlying funds of a Gift Card after a purchase is made will remain on that Gift Card for future purchases.
Purchase
No promotional offers, discounts, or other Gift Cards may be applied to the purchase of a Gift Card. Gift Card purchases are also not eligible for returns or cancellations and all purchases of Gift Cards are final.
Expiration
Gift Cards do not have an expiration date and the underlying funds do not decrease in value over time. Gift Cards also do not carry any dormancy, inactivity, or service fees.
Lost, Damaged, or Stolen Cards & Fraud
Sneakerhead.com does not replace, and cannot be held liable for, Gift Cards which are lost, stolen, inactivated, or damaged after purchase. Sneakerhead reserves the right to refuse, cancel, or hold Gift Cards, and purchases made using Gift Cards, for suspected fraud, incorrectly issued denominations, or for any other violation of Gift Card policies, except where prohibited by law.
Limitation of Liability:
Sneakerhead.com disclaims all warranties of any kind, either express or implied, with respect to the Gift Cards, including without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Sneakerhead.com and its affiliates do not represent or warrant that your Gift Card will always be accessible or accepted. Sneakerhead.com and its affiliates and its vendors shall not be liable to any person or entity for any direct or indirect loss, damage (whether actual, consequential, punitive, special or otherwise), injury, claim or liability of any kind or character whatsoever based upon or resulting from the Gift Cards or use of such Gift Cards. In the event that Sneakerhead.com or its affiliates are found liable to you, your sole remedy will be to recover actual and direct damages which shall not exceed the last balance held on your gift card. Certain provisions of the foregoing paragraph may not apply to consumers within the state of New Jersey or in other jurisdictions prohibited by law.
Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
In the event that our customer service team is unable to resolve your concern, any disputes arising out of your purchase or use of the Gift Cards or these Terms and Conditions will be resolved entirely through binding individual arbitration, rather than in court. You may also assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims otherwise qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration laws apply.
Note: There is no judge or jury in arbitration, no class action, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages, and must follow these Terms and Conditions as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send written notice requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: Sneakerhead.com ATTN: Legal Department, 17777 Center Court Dr, Suite 600, Cerritos, CA 90703, USA. You agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) You can contact AAA at www.adr.org or at 1-800-778-7879 for information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by AAA's applicable rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
You agree to bring any dispute in arbitration only on an individual basis and not on a class, consolidated, representative, or collective action basis. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you agree to waive the right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action. However, both you and Sneakerhead.com may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT BOTH YOU AND SNEAKERHEAD.COM WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY ALSO NOT BE LIMITED.
Applicable Law
The law applicable to the interpretation and construction of these Terms and Conditions shall be the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws and the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, but subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and other federal laws relating to the arbitrability of claims. You agree that all matters relating to the Gift Cards or use of the Gift Cards, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California.

Disputes
Please contact our Customer Service at 1-866-339-7463 if you have any disputes regarding the Program.
Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
Please read this arbitration provision carefully. Unless you send Sneakerhead.com a rejection notice as described in this section, this provision shall apply to you.

You agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) You can contact AAA at www.adr.org or at (800) 778-7879 for information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by AAA's applicable rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

YOU ALSO AGREE NOT TO BRING ANY PROGRAM DISPUTE AGAINST SNEAKERHEAD.COM ON BEHALF OF ANY OTHER PERSON, AND YOU AGREE THAT NO OTHER PERSON MAY BRING A PROGRAM DISPUTE AGAINST SNEAKERHEAD.COM ON YOUR BEHALF. YOU FURTHER AGREE NOT TO JOIN YOUR PROGRAM DISPUTE WITH ANY PROGRAM DISPUTE OF ANY OTHER PERSON. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. HOWEVER, BOTH YOU AND SNEAKERHEAD.COM MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. FINALLY, YOU AGREE NOT TO BRING A PROGRAM DISPUTE AGAINST US IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION IN COURT OR ARBITRATION.
If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Sneakerhead.com and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending an email to legal@sneakerhead.com within thirty (30) days of the date you first accessed or used the Site. Your rejection notice is effective only if it meets the above requirements, is signed by you, and is received within thirty (30) calendar days after the date we first provided you with the Terms and Conditions containing the arbitration provision. Subsequent republications or delivery of the Terms and Conditions will not trigger a subsequent right to reject the arbitration provision. Your rejection of this arbitration provision will not affect any other provision of the Terms and Conditions.
This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). The arbitrator(s) must follow: (1) the FAA; (2) all other applicable substantive law (except when contradicted by the FAA); (3) any applicable statute of limitations; and (4) rules as to valid claims of privilege. Further, the arbitrator(s) shall issue a written decision including the reasons for the award upon either party's request. The decision of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding, except for any appeal rights under the FAA.
This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of the Terms and Conditions and your relationship with Sneakerhead.com. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid, void, or for any other reason unenforceable, that part of the provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining parts of the provision.
Limitation of Liability
By agreeing to participate in the Program, you release Sneakerhead.com, its subsidiaries and affiliate entities, and their respective, directors, officers, employees, and agents (“Released Parties”) from all liability with respect to the misdirection or misuse of Points, and the use of any Program benefit by an individual other than the Member who earned the Program benefit.

If you are an individual you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Site by following the procedure described below.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Sneakerhead.com are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.
If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Sneakerhead.com, Attn: Legal Department, 17777 Center Court Dr, Suite 600, Cerritos, CA 90703, USA. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Site on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Site on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the "Class Action Waiver" section below.
If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Sneakerhead.com and you are an individual, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending an email to legal@sneakerhead.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Site.
Class Action Waiver
Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding ("Class Action"). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.
If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Sneakerhead.com each waive any right to a jury trial.
