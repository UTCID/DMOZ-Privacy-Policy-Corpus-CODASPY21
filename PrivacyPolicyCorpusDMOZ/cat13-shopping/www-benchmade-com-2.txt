Unless prohibited by law, Automatically Collected Information may be combined with Personally Identifiable Information we have collected about you.
3. How We Collect Automatically Collected Information      (a) Cookies We use a feature of your internet browser called a “cookie” (a small file automatically placed on your hard drive or operating device, which assigns you a unique, random number that acts as a sort of anonymous ID) to facilitate Website navigation and internet sessions. Standing alone, a cookie does not identify Personally Identifiable Information of a user; rather, it identifies the computer or device that a user uses to access the Website. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us by providing Personally Identifiable Information, you remain anonymous to us when browsing the Website; in other words, the cookie alone will not allow us to identify you personally. Regardless of whether you have an account on the Website, when you visit the Website, our servers send a session cookie to your computer or other operating device. And we use these session cookies to collect Automatically Collected Information as you browse and use the Website. Session cookies are removed from your hard drive when you close your browser or otherwise end your session on the Website. If you have an account on the Website, each time you log into your account, we use a persistent cookie containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you and to process your online transactions and requests. Persistent cookies are required to use your account. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive even after you close your browser or otherwise end your session on the Website so that the information held in the cookie is still available when you return to the Website. We further use persistent cookies, even if you don’t have an account on the Website, when you put an item in our shopping cart. We use this persistent cookie to save the data for a designated period of time in case the user’s session expires and the user then returns to complete the purchase within that timeframe. We use cookies to collect information about your browser and your computer or device, to later identify your computer or device (by recording your IP address or device ID), to provide Website user authentication and distinguish you from other Website users, to remember your personal settings, to pre-fill forms for you by saving your preferences for future visits, to monitor your use of the Website, to identify the websites you visited prior to and that you visit after visiting our Website, and to compile aggregate data about Website traffic and interactions so we can offer better experiences and tools in the future and to improve our ad targeting. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually disable the acceptance of browser cookies and remove existing browser cookies at any time by changing the preferences in your browser or device. Please refer to your browser or device for information on how to disable and control cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will not be able to use some of the Website and/or some features or services will not function as well. For example, you might not be able to order product through our Website, track your order, register for an account, or access your existing account.      (b) Web Beacons We use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile Automatically-Collected Information about your use of the Website, as well as your interaction with emails from us. Web beacons are clear electronic images imbedded in a web page, website feature, or email, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer or device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Website. We use web beacons to operate and improve the Website and email communications and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Website and opening our emails and for what purposes.      (c) IP Addresses and Mobile Device IDsWhen you visit the Website, we collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and/or mobile device ID to track and aggregate Automatically Collected Information. For example, we use IP addresses and mobile device IDs to monitor the regions from which our Website users navigate the Website. We also collect IP addresses and mobile device IDs from users when they log into their accounts on the Website in order to confirm the applicable user’s identity.      (d) Third Party Cookies and Website Analytics; Our Targeted Advertising Practices We use third party services to track and analyze your Website activity, as well as to track websites you visited before and websites you visit after using the Website. You will encounter session and persistent cookies and other tracking technologies from these third parties on certain pages of the Website, which we have allowed. The information provided to these third parties does not include Personally Identifiable Information; rather, these third parties only collect Automatically Collected Information, such as pages and products viewed and your IP address or device ID. We use the information collected from these service providers to find usability problems to make the Website easier to use, to analyze use patterns, and to improve our products and services.
We also use these third-party persistent cookies and other third-party services to serve our online advertisements to you on other websites and/or mobile applications you visit after you’ve visited the Website. This online targeted advertising is based on your online activity. You will see our advertisements across the Internet, which are served to you by these third-party service providers, unless you opt-out of receiving the online targeted advertisements. We also receive reports from these third parties that include Automatically Collected Information regarding your use of the Website. You can opt-out of receiving online targeted advertisements by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed) or the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or here: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. See more information about your options regarding online advertising here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options. Our online advertisements will also contain an icon or link regarding your advertisement choices, which you can click on to then opt-out of receiving certain ads delivered by that particular ad network. Note that even if you opt-out, you may still see our advertisements, but they will not be delivered based on your online activity. Further, please remember that changing your settings with certain browsers and ad networks will not carry your privacy choices across all browsers and/or other ad networks. The online targeted advertisements described in this Section are different from marketing communications you will receive if you are on our promotional mailing list, which is discussed in Section 4(b) below. 4. Use of Collected Information
We will only use your Personally Identifiable Information if we have a permitted lawful basis to do so. The primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to fulfil the services you request from us. We also collect Personally Identifiable Information (including Automatically Collected Information) for the following purposes:

However, please note this may result in us being unable to provide you with certain features of the Benchmade Services.
Use of Personally Identifiable Information for Marketing Purposes If you sign up for our email updates, we will contact you to provide information about products or services that may be of interest to you, or to provide other information regarding Benchmade, upcoming events and promotions, new products, and other general information about our products and/or services.
With each marketing communication, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future marketing notices by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided through the marketing communication. If you request that we not contact you for marketing purposes, we reserve the right to retain your contact information and to contact you for non-marketing purposes relating to your use of the Website and product purchases. We further retain the right to use your contact information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
If you are based in the EU, we will only make marketing communications if you have given us your consent to do so where you have signed up to receive such updates using a personal (rather than company employee) email address.

Note your Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information will be shared in connection with evaluating such transaction before it happens and as part of the transferred assets. (c)     Required by Law; for Protection Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Statement, we may also use and/or disclose Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information, to any third party, without your consent and without additional notice to you, if we believe we are legally obligated to do so; if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our other customers, third parties, or our employees, property, or business. (d)    Public Areas of Website The Website (in particular the Benchmade Forum) contains one or more areas where users can post content that will be viewed by other Website users and where users can interact with one another. When you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on these areas for public viewing or with other users, the information may be collected, stored, used, and disclosed by other users of the Website. Such activities are beyond our control, and we shall have no responsibility for or liability regarding the protection or security of such information. Do not post information that you want to keep private on these areas of the Website and do not share information that you want to keep private with other Website users when interacting with them. (e)     Social Media Certain pages of our Website might allow you to connect and share information or photographs that you post to our Website with various social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. These features might require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, or application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by such social media platforms to facilitate the communications and features. We might share information you provide to us with these platforms, which information becomes subject to their privacy statements. In addition, by choosing to use any third party social media platform or choosing to share content or communications with any social media platform, you allow us to share information with the designated social media platform.

As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use of your information or content by a third party platform, which you disclose at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of these platforms. (f)     De-identified and Aggregate Automatically Collected Information We may share anonymised and/or aggregated Automatically Collected Information without restriction, where such information will no longer be able to identify you6. Securing Collected Information Our security measures: We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial security measures to assist in protecting against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of Personally Identifiable Information that is under our control. When the Website is accessed using Chrome, Internet Explorer version 8.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 5.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects your Personally Identifiable Information using both server authentication and data encryption during transmission.
User Responsibility: The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. For example, you should not send us sensitive Personally Identifiable Information via email, as this is not secure, and information sent via email is not encrypted. Also, before transmitting sensitive Personally Identifiable Information to us through our Website, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window for an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), which will indicate that the SSL is active and the connection is secure. Please notify us if you become aware that your Personally Identifiable Information is lost, stolen, or used without permission.
DISCLAIMER: Unfortunately, no data storage system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet or wireless network, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and no security system can prevent all security breaches. As a result, we do not and cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which Personally Identifiable Information is transmitted between your computer or device and our servers, or any Personally Identifiable Information provided to us or to any third party to or in connection with the Website or otherwise. 7. Your rights in respect of your Personally Identifiable Information You may update your Personally Identifiable Information associated with your account by logging into your account and editing your account information. Please note that your account and all features of the Website may not function properly if you remove any or all of your Personally Identifiable Information.

If you request that your Personally Identifiable Information be changed or deleted from our databases and/or that we close your account, we will use commercially-reasonable efforts to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our databases, but see Section 8 below regarding why we might maintain some information.

access a copy of the Personally Identifiable   Information held about you
rectify any incorrect or incomplete Personally   Identifiable Information we hold about you
delete, restrict or remove the Personally Identifiable Information we hold   about you

refuse your request   based on the exemptions set out in the applicable data protection laws.
request for proof   of your ID to process the request or request further information
charge you a   reasonable administrative fee for any repetitive, manifestly unfounded or   excessive requests.
If we refuse your request to exercise these rights, we will give   reasons for our refusal and allow you to challenge our decision. If we   have shared your Personally Identifiable Information with others, we will   tell them about your request to rectify, erase, restrict or object to the   processing where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so,   we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personally Identifiable   Information so that you can contact them directly.
If you have any concerns about how we handle your   Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us. If you are not   satisfied after we’ve tried to resolve your issue, you’ll be entitled to   lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator for your country of   residence.
8. Retention and Storage The third parties discussed in Section 5 above may retain your Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information in accordance with the terms of their respective privacy policies.
As outlined in section 4 above, in order to process your transaction, we also obtain from PayPal a token which is not traceable to your twelve-digit card number. We store the token separately from your other Personally Identifiable Information (such as your name and shipping address). We store the token for twelve (12) months after the date of your purchase per the PayPal token expiration policy.We may retain all other Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information in our databases for as long as necessary to meet the relevant purposes for which we’ve collected your Personally Identifiable Information, including for the purpose of satisfying any applicable legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate length of time for holding your Personally Identifying Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm, from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purpose for which we process your data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, along with the applicable legal requirements. As set out in section 7, you may also be able to ask us to remove your information from our databases, unless applicable laws require otherwise.
Note that even after you ask us to remove your information from our databases, it may be impossible to remove some information, such as information tracked in our web server log files and information that may reside in backup files. We may also retain Automatically Collected Information even after you request that we remove your information from our databases, for use in the aggregate and to analyze and improve the Website, our products, and our services. Your Automatically-Collected Information may be retained for the purpose of serving targeted online advertising to you until you opt-out of receiving these advertisements, as described in our Cookie Policy.
Further, even after you request that we remove your information from our databases, we may retain Personally Identifiable Information and Automatically Collected Information for a limited time to comply with any applicable law, rule, regulation, or guideline, to prevent fraudulent activity, to protect ourselves against liability, and to allow us to enforce our contractual or other rights and to pursue available remedies and limit any damages we might sustain. 9.

The Website contains links to other websites (“Linked Sites”), products, and services that are not owned or controlled by us. We provide Linked Sites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of Linked Sites does not imply endorsement by Benchmade of the Linked Sites or the products or services available on the Linked Sites. You access Linked Sites at your own risk, and by accessing them, you leave the Website. We are not responsible for and have not reviewed the privacy practices of the Linked Sites, or the owners or operators of the Linked Sites, the products or services they offer, or the tracking technologies they use. The owners and operators of the Linked Sites, products, or services may have their own policies regarding privacy and security. You should review any Linked Sites, products, or services for their own privacy practices to determine what information about you may be collected and used when you use such Linked Sites, products, or services. 10.
