Shipping
We offer FREE SHIPPING on all products under 94" in width when shipped within the contiguous United States and Canada. For products over 94" in width or vertical blinds over 94" in height, a $70 delivery charge will be applied per line item at checkout. Please note, we cannot ship to PO boxes, FPO or APO addresses.
Most of our products are ground shipped directly to your home from our manufacturers using UPS or FedEx. Oversized products are shipped via freight carrier and can currently only be delivered curbside. These freight carriers may take a little longer to complete deliveries, but we promise it will be worth the wait. Customers may be responsible for any added charges regarding additional requests such as in-home delivery, remote area delivery, etc.
Canadian customers may also be subject to brokerage fees, depending on the chosen delivery method.
Alaska and Hawaii
For deliveries to Alaska and Hawaii, we offer a flat rate of $30 per order containing blinds or shades under 94" wide. Blinds or shades over 94" wide require a $75 freight charge per individual item. Vertical blinds may be subject to additional shipping charges Shutters shipped to Alaska or Hawaii will require a $75 charge for necessary freight shipping. All shutters over 94" are subject to a charge $120 per individual item. Draperies, regardless of size, will only require a shipping charge of $30 per order.
Shipping Carriers
All of our products are automatically ground shipped via UPS, FedEX, or Canada Post unless the product is over 94" wide, vertical blinds over 94” tall, or weighs over 100 pounds. Oversized products are delivered by a common freight carrier and may take slightly longer to arrive. At this time, freight carriers can only provide curbside delivery. Customers may be responsible for additional charges regarding special delivery requests like in-home delivery, remote area delivery, etc.
Production and Shipping Times
Since all of our products are custom created just for you, nothing is made until your order is placed. The time it takes to craft each individual window treatment varies across all of our manufacturers and products. To help you get a feel for how long an order may take to arrive, we have created a handy timetable with the approximate production and delivery times for all of our products.
Be sure to view our Delivery Time Estimates before ordering.
Multiple Shipments
If your order contains a combination of window treatments or brands, your products may be scheduled to arrive at different times.
Delivery Estimates
Our products are custom made based on your specifications.  Once an order is placed, the manufacturer begins production of your window covering.
Production and delivery times are an estimate based on working days (note: weekends and holidays are not included) and vary by manufacturer and type of product.
Delivery times are affected by the distance between the manufacturing facility and where your order is to be shipped.  Oversize orders also add to delivery times as they may require shipping by a common carrier (i.e. trucking lines) which can extend the delivery date by several days.  Back orders on fabrics or materials may also result in a delay.
Most products are automatically ground shipped via UPS.  However, some shipments are sent via Federal Express.  If your order consists of a combination of window treatments or brands, you may receive each of the products at different times in separate shipments.
Please refer to the list below for an approximation of estimated delivery time for your products.
