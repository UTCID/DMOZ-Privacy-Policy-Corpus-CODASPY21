Terms of Use
Gift Card and eGift Card Terms and Conditions
1. Snaptotes Gift Cards (the “Gift Cards” or a “Gift Card”) are issued by Snaptotes to you, and by purchasing, redeeming or attempting to redeem the Gift Card you agree to the following terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”).
2. Treat your Gift Card like cash. We are not responsible for a lost, damaged or stolen Gift Card, and it will not be replaced. The risk of loss and title for the Gift Card pass to you when we put the Gift Card in the mail for delivery to you.  You are liable for any transaction in which your Gift Card is used, even if you did not approve it, and you will not be refunded any value on the Gift Card that is used by someone else in possession of your Gift Card.
3. Gift Cards may only be redeemed by Snaptotes at www.snaptotes.com. Upon redeeming your Gift Card, if your purchase exceeds the amount of the Gift Card, you will need to pay the balance. (When redeeming online or by telephone, this balance must be paid by credit card.)
4. Gift Cards cannot be redeemed for cash or returned for a cash refund. Gift Cards cannot be used to purchase Gift Cards. We will not give cash advances on a Gift Card.
5. Snaptotes is a Missouri corporation; and by purchasing a Gift Card you agree that the laws of the state of Missouri, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and Conditions and your use of the Gift Card.
6. We reserve the right to close a Gift Card account or to refuse to honor or redeem a Gift Card if we believe the Gift Card was fraudulently or inappropriately obtained by you or fraudulently or inappropriately redeemed by you.
7. We reserve the right to change these Terms and Conditions from time to time in our discretion and without providing notice. All Terms and Conditions are applicable to the extent permitted by law.  The Terms and Conditions will be made available via our website at www.snaptotes.com.
8. For balance inquiries, or if you have any questions, please contact us toll free at 1-866-707-3186 or visit www.snaptotes.com.
9. SNAPTOTES MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CARDS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT A GIFT CARD IS NON-FUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH GIFT CARD. Certain state laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages.  If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to you, and you might have additional rights.
10. Any dispute relating in any way to a Gift Card or these Terms and Conditions shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in St. Louis, Missouri. Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
11. Safeguarding your personal information is important to Snaptotes. We may need to collect personal information (such as your name, address, contact details and transaction information) when you use the Gift Card or otherwise deal with us in relation to your Gift Card. To deliver and manage the Gift Card program, your information may be shared within Snaptotes and business partners who assist Snaptotes to run the Gift Cards program, such as IT and service contractors, delivery companies, mail houses and call centers.RETURN TO TOP
