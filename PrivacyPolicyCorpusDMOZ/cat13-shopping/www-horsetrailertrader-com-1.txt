HorseTrailerTrader.com, Trailer Media Group, and its

never a party to any transaction between buyers and sellers. Responsibility for the information contained in trailer listings
lies with the seller.  The price
and other terms of any sale remain subject to direct negotiation between the
buyer and the seller. The prices listed on HorseTrailerTrader.com often exclude
sales tax, finance charges, title fees, and other related charges, which may be
added to the advertised price to arrive at the final sale price.  We can not verify, do not guarantee, and are
not responsible for; the information a seller provides, the products or
services a seller offers, or that a check received by the seller from the buyer
is valid.  Before purchasing goods or
services you have seen on this site, you should substantiate with the seller
any information that is important to your purchasing decision.
When a seller offers a horse trailer for sale through
HorseTrailerTrader.com or a Trailer Media Group website, the seller must be
prepared to sell that horse trailer at the price at which, and the terms on
which, it has been listed. The seller must; have the ability to transfer title
or ownership, accurately provide certain identifying and contact information so
buyers can communicate directly with the seller.
We will not, under normal circumstances, review the content
of electronic messages that are not addressed to HorseTrailerTrader.com or
Trailer Media Group. However, we may rarely release information concerning electronic
messages when it is proper to comply with law (including requests from a law
enforcement agency), to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to protect the
rights, property, or safety of visitors to our site, our advertisers, the
public, or HorseTrailerTrader.com and Trailer Media Group.
We reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to delete,
move, or edit any listings or postings that come to our attention that we
consider unacceptable or inappropriate, whether for legal or other reasons. Trailer
Media Group may change, suspend, or discontinue this website, or any portion of
this website, and reserves the right to deny use of this website to anyone at

rights of Trailer Media Group or Affiliate, or another User of the Site; any
law or regulation; are otherwise objectionable or unsuitable; or constitute
fraudulent activity.  You agree that
monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Trailer Media Group for
violations of the Visitor Agreement, and you consent to injunctive or other
equitable relief for such violations without the requirement that Trailer Media
Group post a bond. Trailer Media Group is not required to provide any refund to
you if you are terminated as an authorized User of the Site because, in Trailer
Media Group's sole discretion, you have violated the Visitor Agreement.
Refund, Return, and Cancellation Policy.
By submitting a listing through our advertising service, you agree to pay the fees specified for the listing package you select, regardless of whether you are successful in consummating a transaction of Third Party Goods or Services as a result of the listing. Take care in selecting your listing package and inputting your listing information; listing fees are generally not refundable, even if you provide erroneous information or fail to consummate a transaction of Third Party Goods or Services.

As a general matter, TMG does not provide refunds for internet ad listings more than 24 hours after a listing is purchased except under the following circumstances: (a) if it took longer than 72 hours for your listing to be posted to the site OR (b) if you mistakenly purchased a duplicate listing for the same trailer and both appear on the site at the time of your request. In order to be eligible to receive a refund under these two circumstances, TMG must receive your refund request in the manner described below within 5 calendar days of your purchase of an internet ad listing.
TMG also reserves the right to make refunds at any time in connection with cases of fraud, abuse, and in other limited instances. TMG does not provide refunds under any other circumstances. Notwithstanding anything in this policy to the contrary, TMG reserves the right to finally determine in its sole discretion whether the criteria for a refund set forth in this policy have been satisfied and to request any additional information relevant to such request.
All refund requests must be in writing and include your name, address, e-mail address, ad ID, trailer description, the last 4 digits of the credit card used to purchase the listing, and the reasons you are requesting a refund. Please send all refund requests through our e-mail contact form.
