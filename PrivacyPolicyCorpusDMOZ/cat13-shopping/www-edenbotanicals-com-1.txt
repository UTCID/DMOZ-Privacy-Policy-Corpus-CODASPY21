Bulk Wholesale
If you are a wholesale customer, please contact us to setup your account. We'd love to discuss your company and specific needs with you. If you are interested in bulk quantities, please contact us for pricing and availability.
California residents: a resale number is required to avoid sales tax. Please contact us with your resale number before you place your order.
Packaging Details
CARRIER OILS are packaged in HDPE plastic bottles (BPA free) for sizes 16 oz and up. The only exception is the kilo size which will come in an aluminum canister (see below). Sizes under 16 oz are packaged in Amber Glass Boston Round Bottles.
HYDROSOL sizes 1 oz - 4 oz are packaged in Amber Glass Boston Round Bottles. Sizes 8 oz - 32 oz will come packaged in blue PET plastic bottles (BPA free). Hydrosols can freeze and expand when temperatures drop which can result in bottle breakage. If you are experiencing extreme cold in your area, please contact us to ensure your shipment comes appropriately packaged.
Essential Oils and Extracts:
SAMPLE SIZES are packaged in 45 mm Clear Glass Sample Vials with a plastic lid and applicator. Samples contain 1 ml (20-30 drops). Expensive oils that are solid at room temperature are shipped as ‘Tiny Samples’ (6 drops). Tiny samples allow you to smell/savor precious oils at minimal cost.
1 ML SIZES are packaged in 45 mm Clear Glass Sample Vials with a plastic lid and applicator and contain 1 ml (20-30 drops). These vials are the same size as the Sample Size listed above but are not available to select as ‘free samples’ because they are either rare & precious and/or high value. This size is packaged this way, as opposed to a larger container with more air space, to help preserve the oil and reduce the risk of oxidation.  2 ML BOTTLES are packaged in Amber Glass Vials complete with black phenolic screwtop cap with LDPE cone to prevent leakage. Orifice (drop) reducers are not included. 5 ML, 10 ML & 15 ML BOTTLES are packaged in Amber Glass Euro Style Bottles and come complete with tamper proof HDPE caps. Bottles with a white cap feature an orifice (drop) reducer. These items are marked with a '*' on individual product pages. If your bottle has a black cap, it will not have an orifice reducer because the product inside is too thick or viscous for use with a reducer.
30 ML BOTTLES are packaged in Amber Glass Euro Style Bottles and come complete with tamper proof HDPE caps. This size does not include an orifice (drop) reducer because we consider it to be a bulk wholesale size.
2 OZ - 16 OZ BOTTLES are packaged in Amber Glass Boston Round Bottles complete with black phenolic screwtop cap with LDPE cone to prevent leakage. These sizes do not include orifice reducers.
KILO SIZES are packaged in aluminum canisters or lined steel drums depending on quantity.
Shipping
Shipping costs are dependent on destination and order weight.
The majority of orders received before 11am PST, Tuesday through Friday, will ship the same day. Due to the high volume of orders received over the weekend during off-business hours, those placed on Monday after 8am PST will ship the next business day. It is our mission to get your package to you as soon as possible. However, estimated delivery times are NOT guaranteed and may fluctuate depending on destination and time of year. Please note: due to the increased volume of mail during the holiday season, the postal service may take an average of 3-10 days longer than normal to deliver your package. Please allow plenty of time to place your order so may receive it when needed.
ESTIMATED DELIVERY TIMES:
*FREE STANDARD SHIPPING: 2-14 days to arrive after processing. Available for all orders within the contiguous USA (does not include Alaska or Hawaii). The Free Standard Shipping option is only available for orders exceeding $49 in value. Please note that our Free Shipping Policy does not apply to Bulk Wholesale Orders exceeding 10 kg. These large orders will be subject to shipping fees.
*USPS 1st Class: 5-14 days to arrive after processing. This delivery time is an estimate and is not guaranteed. Please note that tracking information is often unavailable for this shipping method.
*USPS Parcel Post: 6-8 days to arrive after processing. This method is not recommended for our Hawaiian customers due to lengthy transit times. This delivery time is not guaranteed.
*USPS Priority Mail: 2-3 days to arrive after processing. This delivery time is not guaranteed.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
Missing Shipment
If your package was not delivered as expected, please consider the following:
Is the shipping address reflected on your invoice correct?
Is it possible that your package was stolen? Have you had packages stolen in the past?
Is it possible that your package was delivered to a neighbor?
Could your package have fallen behind bushes or landscaping (surprisingly this is quite common)?
Could someone else living in your household have already brought your package inside?
Please contact us immediately if you have determined your shipment is lost or missing so that we can do our best to investigate. If your shipment was sent via USPS, we recommend that you contact your local post office directly. For shipments via UPS, FedEx or DHL, we will contact these carriers on your behalf. PLEASE NOTE: We are not responsible for any lost claims 60 days after your order was placed online.
International Orders
Eden Botanicals now accepts international orders online! If you have any problems completing your order through our website, please feel free to contact us.
CUSTOMS: Your shipment may be charged additional customs fees or taxes upon entering your country. These additional fees ARE NOT included in the shipping and handling charge already paid to Eden Botanicals. Eden Botanicals is not responsible for extra fees such as import taxes or customs duties. Any tax, tariff or duty charges are the sole responsibility of our customers outside of the United States. We recommend contacting your local customs office prior to placing your order to help you avoid any unforeseen charges.
HAZMAT: Many essential oils are considered to be hazardous (mainly because of flammability) and thus require special handling. These essential oils can be shipped outside of the United States when using specific handling guidelines, which we follow. Any oil considered to be hazardous cannot be shipped via United States Postal Service unless it is in our small sample size of 1 ml. However, hazardous oils can be shipped via UPS, FedEx or DHL. These oils will be subject to special handling and/or fees if they are in sizes of 1 oz or larger. For example, a 4 oz bottle of our Lemon Essential oil will be shipped in 4 x 1 oz bottles to comply with shipping regulations. You may visit My Cart for the hazmat class of each of the oils you would like to purchase. Please contact us if your order contains greater than 32 oz of a hazardous oil in a single order. We would be more than happy to assist you!
AVAILABLE SHIPPING METHODS:
United States Postal Service 1st Class International: We are unable to ship ANY essential oils considered to be hazardous or flammable via this method, for example citrus, frankincense, eucalyptus, unless they are in a sample size of 20-30 drops.

Please note that there is no guaranteed arrival time (will vary by destination), and no tracking information is available.

Returns
All items are UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED. If you are not satisfied with a purchase you may return the item(s) to us undamaged and unused within 2 weeks for an exchange or full refund (minus shipping fees). To complete a return, you must include a copy of your invoice in the box along with a note detailing the reason you are sending the item/items back to us.
Return Policy ExceptionsSAMPLES: All purchases of products in samples size are final. We do not offer returns or refunds for these trial sizes (20-30 drop, 1ml, 6-drop tiny sample, and sampler packs) as they are intended as a convenient tool for quick assessment, not final formulation.
Returns of large orders or high value items may be processed in the form of store credit or a refund minus a 20% a restocking fee. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have a question about this policy.
Please ship returned items to the following address:
Eden Botanicals
Attn: Return
3820 Cypress Dr., #12
Petaluma, CA 94954
*International Returns: Due to high shipping costs, international customers are responsible for all shipping charges related to returning an item and all shipping, duties and customs fees originally associated with receiving the order.
*PLEASE NOTE: We will be unable accept the return of a diffuser once it has been used, unless it is defective.
Out of Stock
Due to the nature of our business, we may be out of stock on particular oils. Oftentimes, we experience an unforeseeable increase in orders, and since many of our distillers are outside the US, it can take several weeks to restock. There are also occasional crop issues and availability that can cause further delays. If you have questions or concerns regarding an out of stock item, please contact us.
Backorders
From time to time you may see a backordered item on your invoice. This happens mostly when you have placed an order, paid for it, and we find once it reaches our warehouse that it is temporarily unavailable, but will be back in stock shortly. As soon as we have it in stock, we ship it out, usually within 2 weeks.
