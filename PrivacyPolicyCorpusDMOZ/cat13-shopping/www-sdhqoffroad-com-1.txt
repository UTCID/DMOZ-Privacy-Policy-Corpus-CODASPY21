SDHQ Privacy Policy
SHIPPING POLICY:
Typically all orders are processed within 24 hours. If we discover a delay in your shipment, we will do our best to contact you right away.
You will notice that no shipping charges are shown during your check out process no matter what method of delivery you choose. We do this to allow you to receive to lowest shipping cost possible. In an effort to keep the cost of shipping down, we try to consolidate shipments, and use the most efficient method of shipping, whether it be freight or UPS ground services. The shipping charges will be determined by our shipping department and you will be notified of the cost. This is the best way for us to give you the lowest cost on shipping your product.
If you have special shipping requirements please contact our sales department. team@sdhqoffroad.com
PROCESSING YOUR ORDER:
After the shipping costs have been calculated, you will be sent an email with an updated link to your order. Your updated order will include your order's shipping costs and be your original order with the letter "A" at the end. While checking for updates on your order please add an "A" to the end of your order number, as your order number without the "A" will show canceled since it has been superseded.
FIBERGLASS SHIPPING POLICY
Our shipping department takes the same time and effort in packaging your products as our engineers do in designing them. However, damage can still occur in shipping. Most of these damaged items can be easily repaired during install and or in paint prep. If this is not the case, the buyer must inspect the packaging and the products carefully upon receiving them, then accept the shipment and if need be, notate any damages and irregularities, such as crushed, torn, punctured, or broken parts on both the packaging and the product, on the freight bill or receipt at the driver’s presence. A signed receipt without any notation releases the carrier as well as SDHQ from any further damage claim. Discovery of damages after a clear delivery becomes the responsibility of the customer.The buyer must notify SDHQ of any damages within 24 hours. In cases of damage with proper notion on receipt, the carrier will determine whether to pay for the repair cost or replacement value of the damaged goods after damage inspection. Replacement value is the amount the buyer paid to SDHQ and is not negotiable. All disputes about the settlement amount shall be addressed with the carrier. SDHQ, under no circumstances, shall be liable for the damaged product or for subsequent settlement of the claim with the carrier.
RETURNS:
We will not accept returns without prior authorization. Please fill out the SDHQ Online Order Return Form. Provide a specific reason for your return, and request a Return Goods Authorization (RGA) number.
SDHQ ONLINE ORDER RETURN FORM
When packaging your parts for shipping, write the RGA number on the outside packaging in large, easily visible letters, and include a copy of the original invoice in the package.
We strongly recommend packing any parts with fragile components with sufficient padding. Note that we are not responsible for products being returned to us that are damaged mid-shipment.
Return the package(s) freight prepaid to:
SUPERDUTY HQ
190 S McQueen RdSte 109. Gilbert, Arizona 85233
Items may be returned if unused within 30 days of shipping, with a 20% re-stocking fee. There are NO returns after 30 days from date of receipt. Freight is nonrefundable.
Refunds will be given on parts only and excludes labor or installation charges, shipping, or any other charges. All parts must be returned in the original package, cannot be damaged or installed, and must be in original condition. All returned parts must be sent freight prepaid and are subject to a re-boxing fee.
Certain parts are not returnable, including but not limited to Special Order parts, wheels and tires that have been mounted and/or installed, electrical items, and closeouts.
Customer returns for parts received as part of a "free shipping" or "shipping special" offer will be credited for the amount of the returned parts less actual outbound shipping charges paid by us and any restocking fee that may apply.
