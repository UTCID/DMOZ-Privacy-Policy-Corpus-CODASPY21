Satisfaction Guarantee & Refunds
We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all purchases. Due to the perishable nature of flowers, it is our policy not to issue a refund on any purchases made. However, we are happy to ensure customer satisfaction by offering replacements for those orders that do not meet our customer's expectations. Alternatively, we might offer free upgrades on future orders or a store credit. Please call us to request help with an order if you are dissatisfied. Some restrictions may apply.
Delivery Policy
We will always try to accommodate a time sensitive order. Same day deliveries are generally available if placed before noon, but may not be available around major holidays. Please call us if you have any questions about the timing of your delivery. If your delivery requires a specific time we will be happy to offer you our express delivery service for an additional fee, if available. Sunday delivery is available when the store is open. If Sunday delivery is not available, your order will be delivered the next day. There is an additional delivery/service fee on most delivery orders. No matter what your budget is, we guarantee that you'll receive a beautiful arrangement that you’ll be happy with.
Deliveries may be requested to arrive in the morning by 12 noon or by 5pm, if the arrangement is being delivered to a business. Special requests will be accommodated to the best of our ability, however, there may be additional fees or restrictions for deliveries needed within two hours of placing an order.
To ensure prompt delivery, recipients may be called to schedule a delivery. If the recipient is unavailable at home, the delivery may be left safely at a door or with a neighbor. Redeliveries are sometimes necessary if the recipient is unavailable, the delivery driver believes the flowers or gift would be damaged or lost by leaving them, or if there are no neighbors available. If the recipient is located at work, we may be required to leave the flowers at a reception area or similar space if we are not allowed direct access to the recipient’s location. We will make every effort to hand deliver the flowers directly to the recipient.
We may attempt to call you or the recipient if we have delivery questions or problems. If you elect to receive an email, you should get a message shortly after the flowers have been delivered. Please note that there can be up to an 8 hour delay on email delivery notifications.
We will do our best to fulfill delivery date and time requests, but cannot always guarantee delivery times and dates, including express delivery options.
*Please note, during major floral holidays such as Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day, we are unable to guarantee any timed delivery requests but will try our very best to accommodate.
Out-Of-Town Orders
We can send flowers through our network of expert florists to most towns in the United States, Canada, and the rest of the world! For orders outside of our local delivery area, one of our florist partners may design and deliver your flowers. Please note that due to local availability, the florist who delivers your order may have to make substitutions to the flowers, vase, or gifts, while doing their best to maintain the overall look and feel of the arrangement you choose. We are unable to control what other florists send and cannot guarantee any specific delivery times or dates for out-of-town orders but will do our best to accommodate any requests. There may be additional fees associated with out-of-town orders. Rarely, we may not be able to find a florist to make and deliver your out-of-town order. If this happens, we will provide alternatives or cancel your order.
Substitution Policy
Due to the availability of certain flowers, substitutions may occasionally be necessary to create your bouquet. Great care is taken to maintain the style, theme, and color scheme of the arrangement, using flowers of equal or greater value. Additionally, the substitution of certain vases or gifts may be necessary due to increased demand, especially during major holidays. In single-flower arrangements, such as an all rose bouquet, or orchids, we will make every attempt to match the flower type, but may substitute with another color.
