Any dispute or claim relating in any way to Gift Certificates or your Wine.com Balance will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and U.S. federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these terms and conditions as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Wine.com, Inc. c/o Legal Department 222 Sutter Street Suite 450 San Francisco CA 94108. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not to seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location.
We and you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We and you also agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Any dispute relating in any way to Wine.com gift certificates shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in Boise, Idaho, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Wine.com's intellectual property rights, Wine.com may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the state of Idaho, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
WCGC reserves the right to change and update these terms and conditions from time to time in its discretion, and your continued use of this website represents acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.
All terms and conditions are applicable to the extent permitted by law.

Program Benefits
Recurring Wine Shipments.
Frequency and Quantity. By enrolling in Picked you agree to receive six (6) bottles of wine at a frequency of your choosing (every 1, 2, or 3 months).
Scheduling. You may accelerate or delay the date of your next shipment any time before your order is processed. Following orders, will be scheduled relative to the date of your last shipment and according to your chosen frequency.
Pricing.
Target Price. The Target Price is the total pre-tax price point for your Picked shipments, which you set up during the enrollment process.
The “Target Price” is the summation of the price points multiplied by the quantities of each type of wine. For example: (3 reds x $30) + (3 whites x $20) = Target Price of $150.
Maximum Price. While we will do our best to match your pre-tax Target Price for each shipment, the actual pre-tax price may differ and vary from shipment to shipment.
The actual pre-tax price may be less than the Target Price, but it will never exceed the Target Price plus $10 (the “Maximum Price”).
Transparent Pricing. The price of each shipment is transparent and reflects the retail prices of the wine you receive.
We do this so that you never doubt our incentives or the wine quality.
Shipping & Taxes. Shipping is always free on your Picked shipments.
Depending on your state, sales tax may be applied.
Wine Experts. The wine expertise provided to you is always free. There are no hidden service fees baked into our pricing.
Cancelations. You may cancel your Picked subscription at any time prior to your next shipment being confirmed by (i) selecting "Cancel" in your Picked Account Settings, (ii) emailing us at CS@wine.com from the email address currently associated with your account, stating that you want to cancel your subscription, or (iii) calling Wine.com Customer Care at 1-800-592-5870.

Subscription Modifications. We will send you an email reminder seven (7) days prior to placing your next order.
You can modify your subscription settings, provide feedback on your prior shipments, or cancel your subscription prior to and during that seven-day period.
Free Shipping.
Picked subscribers will receive free standard shipping on their subscription orders.
Regular shipping charges apply to all other Wine.com orders, except for StewardShip members who have paid for an annual free shipping program.
Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii. When shipping to Alaska or Hawaii, standard shipping is not available so your order will be sent using an expedited method.

100% Satisfaction Guarantee.
Your satisfaction is important to us.

As a part of this process you will try new wines and provide us feedback on them.
If at any time you feel as though a wine you received grossly missed the mark relative to the information and feedback you provided us, we will apply a credit to your next shipment equivalent to the price of that wine (the “Satisfaction Guarantee Credit”).
In order to receive a Satisfaction Guarantee Credit, please contact us by (i) chatting a customer care agent on our website, (ii) emailing us at CS@wine.com from the email address currently associated with your account, or (iii) calling Wine.com Customer Care at 1-800-592-5870.

Recurring Subscription. By enrolling in Picked you agree that until you cancel your subscription, we may charge your Subscription Card on a recurring basis according to the frequency you selected. We will never charge you for an amount greater than the Maximum Price, plus applicable sales tax. You may cancel your subscription at any time, and/or reschedule an upcoming shipment prior to an order being placed.
Representations. You represent that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have authorization to do so. We will not be liable in the event others acting with or without your permission use your credit card to make orders.

Survival
The following provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service: No Warranty from Wine.com, Limitation of Liability, Indemnity and General Provisions.
General Provisions
You agree that Wine.com and its licensors may make improvements and/or changes in the Site Content and services or events described in this Site, if any, at any time without notice and without liability to you of any kind. You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws, keeping in mind that access to the Wine.com Site may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect. The failure of Wine.com to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Wine.com in writing. The Terms of Service, along with the Wine.com Privacy Policy, comprises the entire agreement between you and Wine.com and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, if any, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. These Terms of Service are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms of Service to anyone without the express written permission of Wine.com. Any attempt by you to assign, transfer, or delegate these Terms of Service without the express written permission of Wine.com shall be null and void. These Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of Wine.com's successors, assigns, and licensors. The paragraph headings in these Terms of Service, shown in boldface type, are included to help make the agreement easier to read and have no binding effect.
DISPUTES
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Wine.com Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Wine.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Wine.com c/o Legal Department 222 Sutter Street Suite 450 San Francisco CA 94108. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Wine.com will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
APPLICABLE LAW
By using any Wine.com Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Wine.com.
