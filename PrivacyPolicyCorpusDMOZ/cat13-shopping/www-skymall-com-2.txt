Home Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Statement reflects our commitment to fair information practices.

Whenever possible, we explain how personal information can be corrected, updated or deleted. We keep personal information secure.
This Privacy Statement describes what type of information we collect, use, process, share, disclose, store, transfer and dispose of, including personal information (i.e., information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably used to infer this information, whether sensitive or not) through this website (“Site”). This Privacy Statement also applies to other websites where the Company’s products and/or services are likewise made available to the public online, provided that the Company has control over the personal information collected or processed through such channels.

If you create an Account your payment information may be stored for future use whenever you need it.

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
