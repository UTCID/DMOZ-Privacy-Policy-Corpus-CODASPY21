What is your privacy policy?
Last Updated: February 21, 2012
Effective Date: February 26, 2012.
We at Birthday Express value your business and trust. Therefore, we will not sell, rent, or give away any customers' e-mail address to other businesses. We request your e-mail address so we can send you important information regarding your order (order confirmation, order processing, and tracking number). We may e-mail you coupons or discount offers in the future. We may also share information we collect at our site with other members of the BIRTHDAYEXPRESS.COM family (the Birthday Express website is owned by BIRTHDAYEXPRESS.COM).
They may use this information to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.
Our sites track information about the visits to each site. For example, statistics are compiled that show the daily number of visitors to the site, the daily requests received for particular files on the site, and from what countries those requests come. We may also track information about our users browsing activity as they navigate through our site.
These statistics are used to customize our Web site to better meet your needs and may also be provided to others, but we will not provide any personally identifiable information that may be associated with those statistics to any third parties.
If you supply us with your address online you may receive periodic mailings letting you know about new products and services. If you do not wish to receive these mailings, contact us and we’ll remove you from our list.
If you have placed an order with our company, we may share your mailing address with other reputable companies. We do this so that you can receive mailings and offers from those companies for products or services we think you might like. However, if you would like to have your name put on our do-not-share list, please contact us and we’ll update this information so you don’t receive future mailings.
We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (networkadvertising.org). You may also limit the information collected by managing cookies on your computer or through your preferred web browser and related programs. Information on how to do so may be found a networkadvertising.com.
We limit access to personally identifiable information to a select number of employees who are committed to our privacy and security policies, and who need access to the information in order to perform their jobs.
We collect personal information such as full names, addresses, e-mail addresses, etc, when it's voluntarily given to us by our customers. We do ask parents/guardians for children's birth month and year information so we can send a Birthday Express catalog during that time for party planning.
We also collect payment information so that we can bill our customers for their orders. To complete business transactions, credit card numbers are verified by a qualified financial institution before the order is shipped. So our customers know the status of their order, we’ll send them confirmation emails that provides the order information.
If you no longer wish to receive promotional emails or catalogs from us click here for directions on how to remove your name from our lists. Online contests and sweepstakes may have different rules regarding contact information so please refer to the individual guidelines posted for each promotion
To update any of your contact information send an e-mail with the revised information to service@birthdayexpress.com.
Customers who have given their telephone number online may receive a call from us with information regarding your order. When providing your telephone number, please provide both the area code and phone number. Your phone number will not be shared with anyone.
We occasionally make portions of our mailing list available to carefully screened companies whose products may interest you. If you do not want your name made available - or if you have moved, are receiving duplicate catalogs or would prefer not to receive catalogs from us - send an e-mail to service@birthdayexpress.com. If you would like to remove your name from all mailing lists, visit DMAChoice Direct Marketing Association, at www.dmachoice.org for more information.
If you choose to post a product review, we will display your chosen user name and any additional identifying information that you agree for us to post, including but not limited to age, location, and gender.
