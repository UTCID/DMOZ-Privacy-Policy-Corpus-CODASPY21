Adventure Ready Brands appreciates your interest in our products and company; your patronage at our retail partners and on-line; and your concern for privacy and security of personal information.
Adventure Ready Brands has updated its Privacy Policy ("Policy") as of May 25, 2018, which can be summarized with these 3 basic principles:

We use data only to enhance our relationship with you.

Sharing Your Information
Adventure Ready Brands is in the adventure, safety, and health-care business – not the business of selling data or personal information. Adventure Ready Brands does not ever sell its data and only shares information to the extent necessary to enhance our relationship with you and your relationship with us.
We have partners who help us with things such as fraud protection & investigation, shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research, survey distribution, Adventure Ready Brands advertising across third-party platforms, promotions management, and payment processing.
We share your information with these providers only as needed so that they can perform those services on our behalf.
Some third parties, such as Facebook and Google, use the data to serve you ads that we think may interest you. These third parties may combine the information we share with them with information already in their possession; they may also offer you choices about which ads you see on their platforms.
Some third-party vendors use analytics data for a variety of purposes such as to improve the design and content of our websites, to help us learn which pages are most attractive to all of our visitors and what promotions visitors like to see, and to gauge the success of our advertising campaigns. One such vendor is Google Analytics. Please click here for more information about how data is collected and processed in connection with the Google Analytics service: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
We work closely with our partners to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected and require these third parties keep your personal information secure and confidential. We may allow some of our third-party partners to use the information we share with them for their own purposes, but only if it is anonymized and aggregated, so that it cannot be linked back to any individual.
On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or where otherwise permitted by law.
If another company acquires our company or assets, that company may possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the consents and responsibilities regarding your personal information as described in this Policy.
