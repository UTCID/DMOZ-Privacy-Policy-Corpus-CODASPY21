We also make very clear in our Customer Center that international customers assume total responsibility for using our products in a non-110v setting.“Light/Sound Systems”, “Mind Machines” and other products that contain a light source and come into contact with you have been on the market for years. Thousands of users have logged many hours on them with virtually no reported ill effects. But there are some situations and conditions where use of our products is strongly discouraged. These systems can cause seizures in persons with photosensitive epilepsy. You may have it and not know it, see details in last paragraph below.Light/Sound systems are based upon ancient understandings and modern research about how the mind interacts with certain types of pulsating light and sound patterns. Your experience should feel pleasant and we recommend that you set the volume and light intensity levels before you, or anyone you loan your system to, uses it.Our products are designed for avocational and recreational purposes. No medical claims are made for these products, express or implied. They are not medical devices and should not be used for the relief of any medical condition. Please consult with your licensed medical practitioner prior to use for any other purpose as our products are not intended as a replacement for medical or psychological treatment. Our products are not intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body. These products are not approved for any purpose by the FDA.If you, or anyone else who will use light and sound machines or other machines, are subject to any form of seizures, epilepsy or visual photosensitivity, are using a pacemaker, suffering cardiac arrythmia or other heart disorders, currently taking stimulants, tranquilizers or psychotropic medications, specifically including illicit drugs and alcohol, please do not use our, or any other Light/Sound system. In addition, even if you have never had a seizure, there is a small chance that you have photosensitive epilepsy, and exposure to flashing lights can cause a seizure. About one person in 4000 is subject to photosensitive epilepsy. Most such individuals have a seizure during their teenage years, usually from watching television. Also, many persons with this condition as children, outgrow it by age 25. As a result, persons in the adult population who have never had a seizure have about 1 chance in 25,000 of being photosensitive. If you are not willing to accept this risk, please do not use our systems.While many of our Hemi-Sync products contribute to wellness, they are not intended to replace medical diagnosis and treatment. DO NOT listen to Hemi-Sync while driving or operating heavy equipment, or with other devices that may influence brain-wave activity. If you have a tendency toward seizures, auditory disorders, or adverse mental condition(s), DO NOT listen to Hemi-Sync without first consulting your physician. In the unlikely event that you experience any unusual physical or mental discomfort, immediately discontinue use. DO NOT reproduce Hemi-Sync products or use with Dolby® or other noise-reduction systems. Doing so will diminish the effectiveness of the Hemi-Sync signals.
