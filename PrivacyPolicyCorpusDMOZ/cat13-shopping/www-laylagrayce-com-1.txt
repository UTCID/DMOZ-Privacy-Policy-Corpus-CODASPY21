form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information.
We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.
Will your information be shared with anyone?

More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:

online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information

How long do we keep your information?
In Short. We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal
information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
processing until deletion is possible.
How do we keep your information safe?
In Short.
We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within
a secure environment.
Do we collect information from minors?
In Short.
We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact

our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot

Cookies and similar technologies. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.
If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies.
If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our
Services. You can opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services

Opting out of email marketing. You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time
by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided

Controls for Do-Not-Track features.
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
privacy policy.
Do California residents have specific privacy rights?
In Short. Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding
access to your personal information.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are
California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names
and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding
calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your
request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services,
you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services.
To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below,
and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.
We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data
may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
Do we make updates to this policy?
In Short. Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
"Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes
or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be
informed of how we are protecting your information.
