Privacy Policy
Privacy & Security | Privacy Policy
This privacy policy explains how SummitSports.com collects, uses, and discloses the information of users of the SummitSports.com  Web site (the "SummitSports.com Web site," or "our Web site").
Important terms
When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms "personally identifiable information" and "aggregate information." "Personally identifiable information" is any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you as an individual. Common examples are your name and email address.
"Aggregate information" lumps your behavior or characteristics together with those of a group. For instance, we may let advertisers know that 50% of our users are over 35 without disclosing the personal information of any one individual.
Collecting your information
When you register for the SummitSports.com Web site we collect personally identifiable information, including (but not limited to) your name, physical address, email address, phone numbers, and billing information. All of this information is mandatory; without it we will not register you. We also collect personally identifiable information through purchase forms, surveys, sweepstakes entries, emails we receive from you, and your other interactions with our Web site.
When you use our Web site we may collect a variety of technical data, which we store in both aggregate and, if you are registered with SummitSports.com, personally identifiable forms. This data includes (but is not limited to) your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information. We may track the page you visited before coming to the SummitSports.com Web site, and the page you link to when you leave the SummitSports.com Web site, which of our pages you access, and how long you spend on each page.
The SummitSports.com Web site uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information stored on your computer. Cookies let our Web site recognize previous visitors to our web page, record a visitor's progress from page to page, and recall certain information a visitor entered previously. For instance, a cookie may store your password, or note that you're interested in electronics. You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the SummitSports.com web site may not operate properly. We may also use tracking images and applets to collect the same information.
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. We allow third parties to collect aggregate and other anonymous information about our visitors through the SummitSports.com Web site. Should we enter into agreements that allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about our visitors, we will inform visitors of these activities at the location of the collection. Finally, note that our Web site may or may not contains links to other sites on the Internet. Please remember that if you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Web site and entering another. Again, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites, and encourage you to read their privacy statements (which may differ from ours).
Using Your Information
This section describes how we use and disclose the information we collect.
We use aggregate information about your behavior and equipment to improve the performance of our Web site, and to evaluate your reaction to the content and design of our Web site.

We also use personally identifiable and aggregate information for a variety of marketing and promotional purposes. For instance, we use what we have learned about your preferences to alert you to new areas when you return to our Web site, or to help us or our business partners target advertising or product placements to your particular interests.
From time to time we will send you emails related to the SummitSports.com Web site. At various points during your visits to SummitSports.com, you are provided opportunities to indicate an interest in receiving email about special offers and other promotional information.
