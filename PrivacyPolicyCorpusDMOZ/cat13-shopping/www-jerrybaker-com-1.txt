Any other use of materials on this SITE, including reproduction for purposes other than those noted above, modification, distribution, or republication without the prior written permission of AMP is strictly prohibited.
All books and information on the SITE are protected by copyright, and all rights are reserved. No part of any book or information may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to, photocopying, recording, electronically, via the Internet, or by any other information storage or retrieval system without the express written permission of AMP.
TRADEMARKS
All trademarks, service marks, and trade names (collectively the "MARKS") are proprietary to AMP or other respective owners that have granted AMP the right and license to use such MARKS.
DISCLAIMER
This SITE is intended for users over the age of 18. The information, services, products, and materials contained in this SITE, including, without limitation, text, graphics, and links, are provided on an "as is" basis with no warranty. To the maximum extent permitted by law, AMP disclaims all representations and warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to such information, services, products, and materials, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, freedom from computer virus, and implied, warranties arising from course of performance. In addition, AMP does not represent or warrant that the information accessible via this SITE is accurate, complete, or current.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
In no event shall AMP be liable for any direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, or any damages whatsoever, even if AMP has been previously advised of the
possibility of such damages, whether in an action under contract, negligence, or any other theory, arising out of or in connection with the use, inability of use, or performance of the information, services, products, and materials available from this site. These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
All efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the information on this SITE. AMP assumes no responsibility or liability for any injuries, damages, or losses incurred during the use of or as a result of following the information herein.
Study all directions carefully before taking any action based on the information and advice presented in AMP's books and/or on this SITE. When using any commercial product, always read and follow label directions. If reference is made to trade or brand names, no endorsement by AMP is implied, nor is any discrimination intended.
The brand-name products mentioned in AMP's books and/or on this SITE are registered trademarks. The companies who own these trademarks and make these products do not endorse, recommend, or accept liability for any use of their products other than those uses indicated on the package label or in current company brochures.
HEALTH INFORMATION
Any of AMPs books and/or pages on this SITE concerning health information are intended as a reference volume only, not as a medical manual. Although the information presented may help you make informed decisions about your health, it is not intended as a substitute for prescribed medical treatment. If you have a medical problem, please seek competent medical help immediately. AMP assumes no responsibility or liability for any injuries, damages, or losses incurred during the use of or as a result of following the information in AMP's books and/or on this SITE.
Please note that herbal research is still in its infancy, and the interaction between herbs and pharmaceutical products remains largely unknown. Herbal remedies and nutraceuticals can have effects similar to those of pharmaceutical products. As a result, they are not without risk. They can interact with each other or with conventional medications, and some people may experience an allergic reaction or other adverse effects when starting an herbal or nutraceutical regimen. That's why you should always check with your doctor before you use them. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and children under the age of 18 should not use herbal or nutraceutical products without their doctor's specific recommendation.
If you choose to utilize any information provided by AMP in AMPs books and/or on this SITE, you do so solely at your own risk. When using AMP's books and/or this SITE, as with all matters concerning your health in general, you should always seek the advice and guidance of a qualified health care provider before:
Making any adjustment to any medication or treatment you are currently using.
Stopping any medication or treatment you are currently using.
Starting any new medication or treatment, whether or not it was discussed on this SITE.
PRICING AND AVAILABILITY
Prices and availability on this SITE are subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of AMP.
AMP has the right to revise and update these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notification, so it is advisable that you visit this page occasionally to remain updated on possible revisions.
DISPUTES
RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS OR DISPUTES. Any claim or dispute between you and AMP (or any of AMP's subsidiaries or affiliates) arising out of relating in any way to AMP's products or services shall be resolved through final, binding arbitration. This arbitration obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a breach of contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Both you and AMP specifically acknowledge and agree to waive your right to bring a lawsuit based on such claim(s) or dispute(s) and your right to have such lawsuit resolved by a judge or a jury.
LIMITATION OF LEGAL REMEDIES. All such arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual and not a class-wide basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that you are specifically prohibited from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others, or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.
a.Before commencing any such arbitration proceedings, you must first present the claim or dispute to AMP by calling 800-720-0099, asking for the Legal Department, and allowing AMP the opportunity to resolve the claim or dispute. If your claim or dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days, you may commence arbitration proceedings in accordance with the terms set forth herein.
b.The arbitration of any such claim or dispute shall be conducted pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") United States Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.

c.The arbitration of any such claim or dispute shall be conducted in the State of Michigan or the location in which you received this Agreement.
d.All administrative fees and expenses of any such arbitration will be divided equally between you and AMP, except that: (a) if the claim is less than one thousand dollars (US $1,000), you will be responsible for no more than twenty-five dollars (US $25) in administrative expenses, and AMP will pay all other administrative costs and fees. In any such arbitration, each party will bear the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation of evidence and the Arbitration.
APPLICABLE LAW. By using any AMP product(s) or service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws, and the laws of the state of Michigan, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute that may arise between you and AMP.
SEVERABILITY. If any provision herein is declared or found to be unlawful, unenforceable, or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that is found unlawful, unenforceable, or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions shall remain fully enforceable.
