All apparel items on the Aloha Shirt Shop website are shipped for free within the U.S. for the entire order using standard shipping, normally first class mail. Any back ordered item(s) from original order will also be shipped free of shipping charges. Most items are shipped by USPS first class or priority mail, UPS or Fed Ex ground services. We reserve the right to select the method we wish to use. Most items will arrive in 2-7 days from shipment date, depending on service selected. We make every effort to ship each order the same day it is received. Occasionally due to back orders from manufacturers and other matters beyond our control, orders can be delayed as much as 2-3 days at best, longer occasionally. If you have special requirements please note them in the comments section of the order form. We will make every effort to accommodate.
Express Shipping
Express shipping is available for an additional cost and must be chosen at time of order. Express is defined
as standard 2 day delivery in the United States. We have a fixed price

shipped on the next business day. Express orders placed on Saturday
or Sunday will be processed and shipped on the following Monday morning. Our express
charges do not include Sunday delivery so any order placed on Friday will be delivered the following Monday. We do offer actual
overnight delivery via UPS and FedEx but at a substantial additional charge. Please call for details. While we strive to provide the best service anywhere, we are not responsible for weather, equipment or other
acts, natural or unnatural, that might delay service.

Sizing
Probably the most frequent question we receive is about sizing. And probably the simplest answer we can give is this. If you think of yourself as a large or extra large etc., then you probably are. Our clothing comes from the finest companies in the industry. As with all better quality clothing, very strict guidelines are used to produce each piece. Each manufacturer will use the same basic size standards, although there may be a variance of 1/2 inch in the charts shown below. Hawaiian wear is intended to be worn loosely and comfortably. After all, one of the great joys of our products is the cool, casual and comfortable (fit and lifestyle) they provide.
Please note: Not all items are available in the sizing charts shown. Please refer to the pull down menu below each item. Also, not all brands are going to fit the same. This is a basic guideline. Within the product details page for each item, we have noted whether a particular shirt seems to run larger, smaller, or as expected.
Measurements below are guidelines for the actual sizes of our clothing and are not the same as your measurements. For best fit, measure a comparable existing item that fits you the way you would want your new item to fit. Lay it flat and compare those measurements with the charts below. When in doubt order the size you are most used to wearing. Remember, Aloha wear is designed to be worn loose and comfortable.

Care Of Your New Items
Each clothing item will have a care or cleaning tag attached. Read these tags carefully. For best results we recommend cold wash and cool or hang dry. Most silks require dry cleaning by a reputable cleaner. Some silks are hand washable and hang dry. Please consult the care instruction tag attached inside each shirt. For foolproof care, turn to your local professional cleaners. You have an investment, both monetarily and emotionally in your new clothing. When in doubt please call us or refer to your local professional. If you follow these instructions your new items will retain size and color for years to come. We will not be responsible for clothing that is shrunk or otherwise damaged by not following proper care instructions. The only thing that will shrink clothing is heat from either the wash or the drying process.
Fabric Types And Characteristics
Cotton - A unicellular, natural fiber that grows in the seed pod of the cotton plant. Fibers are typically 1/2 inch to 2 inches long. The longest staple fibers, longer than 1-1/2 inch, including the Pima and Egyptian varieties, produce the highest quality cotton fabrics. It is one of the world's major textile fibers. There are four main types of cotton: American Upland, Egyptian, Sea Island and Asiatic. The flowers from which these different types of cotton are obtained vary in color and texture, thus providing each type of cotton with varying characteristics. Cotton, in general, is very elastic. It can withstand high temperatures, is very washable and is very susceptible to dyes.
Cotton Lawn - A light, fine cloth made using carded or combed linen or cotton yarns in a plain weave. The fabric has a crease-resistant, crisp finish. The name derived from Laon, a city in France, where linen lawn was manufactured extensively. It is light weight, sheer, soft, and washable. It is crispier than voile but not as crisp as organdy. When made with fine high count yarns, it has a silky feel. Comes in white or may be dyed or printed.
Spooner Kloth - A
trademarked Reyn Spooner name for a cotton polyester blend. As described
by Reyn Spooner: Introduced by Reyn Spooner® in 1964, this traditional
classic has become the oxford cloth of the islands. Combining the cool
comfort of combed cotton with the wrinkle free properties of spun
polyester, Spooner Kloth™ is guaranteed to give years of wash n wear
durability. Due to its unique nature, the slight irregularities in
weaving and subtle variations in color that occasionally occur are
natural characteristics of this woven fabric. Spooner Kloth™ fabric will
continue to develop its personality and improve with age.
Silk – A fiber produced by the silkworm Bombyx mori, also known as the mulberry silkworm, with which the worm weaves its cocoon. One of the finest textiles, silk is soft, has a brilliant sheen, and is very strong and absorbent. A luxurious fabric, silk is lush to the touch and drapes beautifully on the body. It is sensitive to sunlight as well as perspiration and must be carefully laundered. While silk is essentially organic, standards are being developed for organic certification of silk.
Rayon or Viscose - A manufactured fiber of natural composed regenerated cellulose, derived from wood pulp, cotton linters, or other vegetable matter. One of the most peculiar fabrics in use today. Strictly speaking, it is not an artificial fiber, because it is derived from naturally occurring cellulose. It is not, however, a natural fabric, because cellulose requires extensive processing to become rayon. Rayon is usually classified as a manufactured fiber and considered to be "regenerated cellulose". Rayon is the oldest manufactured fiber, having been in production since the 1880s in France, where it was originally developed as a cheap alternative to silk.
Modal - Considered
a type of rayon, modal is made only from beechwood fibers. Most other rayons are made of the wood pulp of a number of different trees. Like
other types of rayon, which were originally marketed as "artificial silk," modal is soft, smooth and breathes well. Its texture is similar
to that of cotton or silk, and it's cool to the touch and very absorbent. Like cotton, this textile dyes easily and becomes color-fast
after submersion in warm water.
Linen - A fabric made from linen fibers obtained from inside the woody stem of the flax plant. Linen fibers are much stronger and more lustrous than cotton. Linen fabrics are very cool and absorbent, but wrinkle very easily, unless blended with manufactured fibers.
Polyester - A manufactured fiber introduced in the early 1950s, and is second only to cotton in worldwide use. Polyester has high strength (although somewhat lower than nylon), excellent resiliency, and high abrasion resistance. Low absorbency allows the fiber to dry quickly.
Lyocell / Tencel - A high-performance fiber used to make soft, beautifully draping rayon fabrics. It is a strong, easy-care fabric made of cellulose extracted from wood pulp that is harvested from replenished tree farms. It's environmentally sensitive and washable. This elegant eco-fiber is derived using a non-toxic process, which spins it into a buttery-soft machine washable textile, both luxurious and upscale. Tencel is 100% biodegradable, durable, dyeable, and machine washable/dryable. It is elegant and ultra-soft, offering an incredible drape and versatility.
Polynosic - Polynosic is a type of microfiber that is a blend of advanced polyester and rayon fibers. Characteristics include luxurious soft touch and excellent drape. Features similar characteristics to cotton and silk, has excellent luster and very little shrinkage.
