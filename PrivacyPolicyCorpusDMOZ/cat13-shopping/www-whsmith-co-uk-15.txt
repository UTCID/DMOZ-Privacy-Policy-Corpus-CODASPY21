I Bought from a WHSmith Store. What is the Returns, Exchange and Refund Policy?
We hope you are delighted with everything you buy from us. However, if for any reason you are not, simply return it to us within 30 days of purchase in its original condition and with your receipt, and we will gladly find you a replacement or refund your money.
The only exception to this is Gift Cards as WHSmith High Street Limited acts as the agent for the third party participating retailers in the sale of Gift Card products. Therefore, any customer queries after purchase must be directed to the relevant participating retailers. Gift Card products can be purchased with WHSmith Giftcards, cash or credit/debit cards only. Multi-retailer vouchers/cards cannot be used to purchase these products. The WHSmith returns, exchange and refund policy does not apply to these products. Expiration of all Gift Card products varies. Please check individual Gift Cards for expiration date.
This is in addition to your statutory rights.

I Ordered Online from WHSmith.co.uk. What is the Returns, Exchanges and Refund Policy?
UK consumers and consumers from the rest of the European Union have the right to cancel contracts for the purchase of items within fourteen (14) calendar days of the day after receipt of the ordered goods. We offer an extended cooling off period of 30 calendar days after receipt of the ordered goods (exclusions apply).
You can cancel your contract at any time up to 30 calendar days starting the day after delivery. To do this, please return your item(s) to us by post or to a WHSmith highstreet store. Unwanted products should preferably be returned in their original packaging or otherwise adequately packaged, and returned as soon as reasonably practicable.
Return to store: Return the item to a WHSmith High Street store along with the email we sent you when we dispatched it. Refunds are only made onto the card that made the original payment, not in cash. PayPal payments are refunded to your payment card. Items paid for by Laybuy cannot be returned to store.
Return by post: The return is at your own risk and at your own cost and we will not refund your costs in returning the item to us and other services provided to you in connection with the purchase such as recorded or courier delivery. Include the reason for the return, your order number and your email address or telephone number. We may withhold refund until the item(s) are returned (or evidence of return is provided by you). Please note that Same Day Click & Collect orders can only be returned to store and will not be accepted by post.
To return items over 1m long, arrange collection: If you wish to return an item over 1m long please contact us to arrange collection.
If you fail to return the goods, we are entitled to collect them, and charge you the direct cost of collection. If you fail to take reasonable care of the goods before they are returned to us, and this results in damage or deterioration, we will charge you for the reduction in value.
This cancellation policy does not affect your legal rights - for example, if goods are faulty or misdescribed.
You should inspect any product(s) you purchase from the website as soon as you can after delivery and notify us if you consider they are defective as soon as possible. If a product is incorrect, faulty or defective you are entitled to either:
During the first 30 days after the delivery date, you can ask us to reimburse the price paid for the relevant product(s) to the credit, or debit or gift card used to purchase the goods.
During the first 6 months after the delivery date, you can ask us to repair the product(s) at our own expense, or ask us to supply replacement product(s) free of charge.
If you are sending something back that's faulty or incorrect due to our error, we will refund the return postage costs to your payment card, but not in other circumstances.
If the item is not working, refer to any warranty information relating to it. It may be quicker for you to get a replacement product direct from the manufacturer rather than by returning it to us.
You have statutory rights against us and any warranty applicable to an item is additional to those rights. You can also obtain free legal advice on your statutory rights in relation to faulty or misdescribed goods from Trading Standards (via Citizens advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506) or your local Citizens Advice Bureau. Our Customer Service Team will also be able to advise you - call them on.0333 6005000 or email them.
