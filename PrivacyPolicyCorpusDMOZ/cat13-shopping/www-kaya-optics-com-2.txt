Non-Personally-Identifiable User Information
For each visitor to our websites, we collect non-personally-identifiable
information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data,

manage the website, track website usage, provide context for referring traffic
sources, and improve overall website performance. This
non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to
provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses
are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. If you arrived at our website
via a link from another webpage, we may receive aggregate or otherwise anonymous
statistical information about your visit to our site. We monitor customer
traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the
site, and to improve the content of our website to better match the interests of
our website users.

Kaya uses cookies to store visitors’ preferences and to record session
information, such as shopping cart items, for purposes including ensuring that
visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements and to customize
newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user
profile information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any
personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You may be
able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or

advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your
computer. Advertisers’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies,
not the Kaya Privacy Policy.
Web Beacons
One or more of our third party advertising partners employ a software technology
called Web Beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by informing
us what content is effective. Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique
identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s
computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are
about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the
information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable
information.

We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server
companies. Ads appearing on this Web site may be delivered to users by Kaya or
one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set
cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time
they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile
information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their
advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows
an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Kaya
and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
3rd Party Service Providers
We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, a
credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, & an email
service provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you order products from
Kaya, we will share your name, email address, shipping address & order contents
as necessary for the third party shipping company to fulfill your order. These
third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information
for promotional purposes. We do NOT share, sell, rent or trade personally
identifiable information with 3rd parties for their promotional purposes.

Kaya contains links to other websites. Kaya is not responsible for the privacy
policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, a user

Co-Branded Websites
At times Kaya will partner with 3rd party websites in a co-branded relationship,
where a co-branded web page(s) is used to promote Kaya products, services,
photos or videos. These web pages may be designed to look & feel just like or
kaya-optics.com, but are actually hosted on a different domain. When we enter
into co-branded partnerships we may at times share your name and email address
in order for Kaya to communicate with you about Kaya related promotions, news, &
updates via tools provided by our 3rd party co-branded partner website.
Information collected on 3rd party co-branded webpages may not be covered under
our privacy statement. All information collected on 3rd party co-branded
websites is owned and controlled by that companies privacy statement. Please be

and/or opt-in methods prior to posting a name, city, or stated activity/interest
along with any testimonial.

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Kaya will not disclose
personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is

to that successor in interest. For more information, see the “Changes in Our
Privacy Policy” section below.
Changes in Our Privacy Policy

deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the
right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it
frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here,

Community and Aggregate Information Security
Kaya takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept
private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored
within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those
employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer
service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the
security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member
information at any time. For any additional information about the security
measures we use on Kaya, please contact us by filling out the contact form
located at www.kaya-optics.com/support/

sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order
forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We take the same care when we transmit your sensitive information to 3rd Party
Services to facilitate your order by using the same SSL technology. To learn
