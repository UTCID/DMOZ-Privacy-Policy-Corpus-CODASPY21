User Submissions
The Site may allow you to submit or transmit audio, video, text, or other materials (collectively, "User Submissions") to or through the Site. When you provide User Submissions, you grant to the Company a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute and display such content throughout the world in any media, whether now known or hereafter invented, including for commercial or marketing purposes, and to use your name or likeness alone or in connection with such uses.
Except as provided in our Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that User Submissions will be private, even if the User Submission is in a password-protected area. Accordingly, you should not provide User Submissions that you want protected from disclosure.
By providing User Submissions through the Site, you represent, warrant and covenant that you own those User Submissions or otherwise have the right to grant to us the rights described in this section. You further represent, warrant and covenant that the User Submissions:

will not contain software viruses, political campaigning, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam"; and
will not contain advertising or other commercial material, except with our prior written consent.
We may refuse or remove a User Submission without notice for any reason, including our belief that a User Submission may violate these Terms or be otherwise objectionable.

Links to Third Party Site
KosherVitamins.com (The Site) may contain links to other sites that are not operated by our company. These links are provided as a convenience to you. However, we do not represent that we have endorsed or evaluated the information on those other sites. Your relationship with the operators of these third-party sites is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policy, if any, of those sites, and not by these Terms. Therefore, you should review those documents before using the third-party services.
Commercial Transactions
The Site allows you to purchase products or services. The Site is based in the United States. All transactions on this Site will be deemed executed in the United States. To purchase any products or services on the Site, you must (a) be at least eighteen years of age, (b) provide us with valid payment information associated with a credit card or other payment method that you are authorized to use, and (c) authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for the price of the products or services that you request, together with any taxes, fees, or shipping charges described on the Site.
We stand behind the products and services that we sell, and we will list the return policy that will apply to purchases from the Site. In general, we accept returns for a limited period of time following a purchase, and your sole remedy if you are dissatisfied with a product that you have purchased through the Site will be to return the unused and unopend portion of the product for a refund. After the return period has expired, all sales are final, and we will not accept returns or issue refunds.
In offering product descriptions and claims on the Site, we attempt to be accurate, but we do not warrant that any product description or claims are accurate, complete, or error-free, nor do we represent that any product will diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. If you receive a product and believe that it materially differs from the product description, your sole remedy will be to return the product to us for a refund in conformance with the return procedures listed on the Site. Likewise, we attempt to list the current price for each product that we sell, but a small number of products may be mis-priced. In these cases, we will notify you before shipping the product of the corrected price and will either cancel your order or give you an opportunity to cancel your order or decide to keep your order.Warning to California Residents:
Chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity are present in dietary supplements, nutritional food powders, juice beverages, common grocery items (i.e. coffee, fried and baked goods) and other products sold at KosherVitamins.com. Some or all of the products you are ordering from KosherVitamins.com may contain these chemicals. These chemicals are not added to the products but are naturally occurring in many of the starting raw materials (ingredients) and/or results from the processing (cooking) of these products. California's Proposition 65 (commencing with section 25249.5 of the Health and Safety Code) requires that producers, manufacturers and retailers of certain products provide customers with special warnings for products which contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, if the consumer is exposed to those chemicals in concentrations above certain thresholds. KosherVitamins.com is committed to compliance with CA Proposition 65 and to the safety of our customers. Accordingly, we provide the following warning for all products linked to this page:"WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."Please Note: It is a well-known fact that Prop 65 has spawned lawsuits against several thousand companies that distribute, store, manufacture or sell products containing Prop 65 chemicals. These lawsuits in some cases with no merit, have presented costly challenges to defend against opportunist individuals taking advantage of regulations mandated by Prop 65.
Read more about Prop 65 at:http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65.htmlBy moving forward with the KosherVitamins.com check-out process, you verify that you have read the CA Prop 65 warning (above), and are purchasing these products from KosherVitamins.com with full knowledge.
International Orders
By confirming your order for shipment outside the United States, you agree to the additional terms contained in this section.
All International shipments will be charged postage costs calculated by weight and destination. Our prices do not include customs fees, taxes and tariffs. Customers outside of the United States may be subject to customs fees and/or import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. You, the customer, are solely responsible for any additional customs clearance fees; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. It is your responsibility to make sure that you are allowed to import nutritional supplements and products from the U.S.
If any package is returned to us because of an incorrect address, because you refuse the package, or for any other reason other than solely because of our error, you will be responsible for our shipping cost for the return and reshipment of the package. If the cost to return the package to us exceeds the cost of the goods ordered, or if you have ordered products that we are informed cannot be imported into the country of intended delivery, we may instruct the shipping company to abandon the package, but even if we do so, you will remain responsible for payment.
Additionally, you are considered the importer of record for all shipments from us, and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country of destination and all laws and regulations the United States imposed of exports to that country. You agree to pay any fees, fines, or other costs charged to us or to you in connection with any non-compliance with laws and regulations of the country of destination.
If we decide to allow return of an item that has been rejected because of import or other legal compliance issues, we will refund the purchase price of the merchandise, less any charges we incurred in connection with the shipment, such as quarantine fees, exam fees, demurrage charges, or warehousing fees assessed in the destination country or in the United States upon return of the goods, and less the shipping costs to return the package to us.

In certain states, the law may not permit the disclaimer of warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to you.
