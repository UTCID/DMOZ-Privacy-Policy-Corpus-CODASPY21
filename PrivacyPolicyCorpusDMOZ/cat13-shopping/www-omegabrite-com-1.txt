Introduction
Welcome! You have arrived at a web site that is provided by Omega Natural Science, Inc and our affiliates and certain other third parties (“OmegaBrite” or “we,” “our” or “us”).
Your agreement with us includes these, our Privacy Policy, Return and Exchange Policy, Shipping Policy, and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section (collectively referred to together as the “Terms”.)
The Terms govern your use of www.omegabrite.com (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of our site and our site store), and also applies to your use of all features, applications, content, downloads, products, auto-renewal programs, customer service, and other services that we make available through the site, through our customer service via phone, email, and other forms of communication, and/or that post a link to these Terms (collectively, referred to herein as the “Site”). By using the Site, you acknowledge and accept the Site’s Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy, and to be bound by these Terms.
Please read the Terms carefully. They cover important information about the Site and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. The Terms include information about future changes to the Terms, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.
If you wish to review the provisions of the Terms, the effective version of the Terms can be found on OmegaBrite’s website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Terms, accept these Terms, and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Terms, then you may not use the OmegaBrite Site or consume any Content or OmegaBrite products or services.
If You Want to Use This Site,
then carefully read these entire Terms (including all links to details), as they constitute a written agreement between you and us and they affect your legal rights and obligations. Each time you access and/or use the Site (other than to simply read these Terms), including by ordering any product from OmegaBrite, whether by clicking through over the internet, telephone, facsimile or otherwise, the customer agrees to be bound by these Terms you agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms (defined below) then posted. Therefore, do not use the Site if you do not agree.
The business realities associated with operating the Site are such that, without the conditions that are set forth in these Terms — such as your grants and waivers of rights, the limitations on our liability, your indemnity of us, and arbitration of certain disputes – OmegaBrite would not make the Site available to you.
In some instances, both these Terms and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of use or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Site or to a service or product offered via the Site (in each such instance, and collectively “Additional Terms”).

Auto-Renewal Terms
OmegaBrite’s automatic-renewal program (referred to interchangeably throughout these Terms, Additional Terms, throughout the website, on other documents, and by customer service by phone, email and other forms of communication as “AutoRefill”, “Auto-Ship”, “Subscription” and other names) is a program in which you place an order for an AutoRefill specific item to create one or more AutoRefill programs, also called an AutoRefill account, in which you are requesting and authorizing us to automatically ship your order and charge your credit card for the order you selected, including shipping and handling, and tax, on a regular basis until you cancel, which you can do anytime, effective five days after the date you cancel.
.
The price of the product is separate from shipping and handling, which may vary from order to order outside of our control. You accept that there may be a change in the shipping and handling price, which you acknowledge is outside of our control and you waive any notice of such a change, including but not limited to as it affects your AutoRefill orders, however, this does not apply to a change in product price that affects your AutoRefill orders, which we will notify you of in advance, per the related provisions in these Terms, which you can view here. as shipping and handling rates vary.
.
When you place that order you specify a frequency you would like (the default on the website as it says is every 30 days). Each AutoRefill program is associated with a single item (in the quantity you choose), so, as an example, by placing an order for two AutoRefill items, you create two independent AutoRefill programs, each of which must be managed, adjusted, and / or cancelled individually. If you have more than one AutoRefill program, the system may automatically group them all into a single order that may charge and ship as one, but each unique item has its own independent AutoRefill program.
.
Your first order will charge and ship generally within 24 hours of you placing it. Your AutoRefill program then automatically creates new orders for you, and charges your card and ships your products, according to the frequency you specified (so, if your frequency is 30 days for instance, then your next order would be automatically created 30 days from the date of your first order, then 30 days from that date, and so on and so forth), and continues indefinitely until you decide to cancel. (The time period between each AutoRefill order and the next one is referred to herein as the “Subscription Period”).Its important to understand that by enrolling in AutoRefill, usually by purchasing an AutoRefill product, you are requesting that we automatically charge your card and ship your product to you according to your chose frequency (usually every month) with no set end date, meaning you have to go into your OmegaBrite account or contact us to cancel it. That cancellation will apply to the next order at least 5 days from the date of cancellation (to cancel your next immediate order in your AutoRefill program you must cancel at least five days prior to the date its currently scheduled to be generated, otherwise the cancellation will apply to the subsequent order). Remember, if you ordered multiple AutoRefill items, even if you receive them in the same order, you must cancel EACH AutoRefill programs separately. Performing a cancellation on one AutoRefill program has no effect on any others you may have.By proceeding with your order and completing the checkout process, you are thereby consenting to the above and are thereby authorizing each of those purchases and corresponding credit card charges.
How to Cancel Your AutoRefill Program
Use one of the following methods to cancel your AutoRefill Program. Your cancellation will take effect five days from the date you cancel, as further clarified in regard to cancellation via physical mail per Method 3 below.
.
Method 1:
Log into your OmegaBrite.com Account
Click on each of your subscriptions
For each of them, click the “suspend” link
Confirm in the popup window
Verify that the refreshed version of your subscription page reflects the word “suspended”
.
Method 2:
Call us at 1-800-383-2030 or email us at updates@omegabrite.com and request that we cancel your AutoRefill program (you should include reference to your full name, billing address, and subscription ID in your email or have the same on hand when you call).
.
Method 3:
Fill out our Cancellation Form, which you can download here
Email, fax, or mail it to us at updates@omegabrite.com, 1-781-652-0504, or Omega Natural Science, Inc., 8275 S Eastern Avenue, Suite 121, Las Vegas, NV 89123, USA, respectively. *If you choose to mail the form, then the cancellation will apply five days from the date we receive the form, not the date you sent it.
.
You may adjust your frequency at any time yourself by logging into your OmegaBrite account or by contacting us at 1-800-383-2030 or updates@omegabrite.com. Your adjustment will apply to the order after the next order in your AutoRefill program (so your next order will go out on the date it was already scheduled to, but the AutoRefill program will calculate the one after that based on your updated frequency). Your change must be received within five days of your next order or it may apply to the next order after it (so if you make your adjustment within two days of your next order, the AutoRefill program may calculate the one after it with the current frequency, and use your updated frequency to calculate all ones after that one).
.
If you wish to adjust the date your next order will ship and charge, or skip an order, you can do that also yourself by logging into your OmegaBrite account or by contacting us at 1-800-383-2030 or updates@omegabrite.com. This will affect your immediate next order, but then the AutoRefill program will calculate the order after that based on the current frequency as usual. Your change must be received within five days of your next order or it may apply to the next order after it (so to adjust the date your immediate next order will ship and charge, you need to make the adjustment at least five days prior to the currently scheduled date).
.
This section applies to your enrollment in AutoRefill by any means, including but not limited to phone, internet or website, email, chat, mail, or fax, and whether you personally enrolled or someone else in your household did on your behalf.
.

The cancellation will take effect five days after the date you make or give us notice of the cancellation. Orders that have already been generated, regardless of whether you have received the orders or they are still processing or in transit, and orders already scheduled to be generated within the next five days cannot be cancelled and, except as expressly provided in these terms, OmegaBrite will not refund any corresponding fees that you have already paid or are scheduled to pay for the aforementioned orders, therefore it is important to understand that if you desire to cancel your next AutoRefill program applicable to your next order, you must do so at least five days before it is scheduled to be automatically created. The limitation section sets forth further terms relating to the cancellation of your AutoRefill program.
.
AT THE END OF YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD (THE NUMBER OF DAYS YOU SPECIFIED AS YOUR FREQUENCY AFTER YOUR INITIAL ORDER DATE, OR IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE DATE YOUR INITIAL ORDER IS CHARGED AND SHIPPED) WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE AUTOREFILL PROGRAM, ON THAT FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, ON A RECURRING BASIS AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD THEREAFTER UNTIL YOU CANCEL PER THE CANCELLATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS LAID OUT IN THESE TERMS HEREIN. BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUTO-REFILL ORDER, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE OR CHARGES USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS FIRST CHARGE, OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE AUTO-REFILL PROGRAM OR PROGRAMS THROUGH YOUR OMEGABRITE ACCOUNT’S SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR BY CONTACTING US BY EMAIL AT UPDATES@OMEGABRITE.COM OR BY PHONE AT 1-800-383-2030 AT LEAST FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, OR FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE END THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AUTOREFILL PROGRAMS, WITH RESPECT TO THE ORDER SCHEDULED TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, CANNOT BE TERMINATED ONCE THE CURRENT DATE IS, OR IS LESS THAN, FIVE DAYS FROM THE END OF THAT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, OMEGABRITE WILL NOT REFUND ANY CHARGES FOR ORDERS THAT EXIST ALREADY AT THE DATE OF CANCELLATION, OR THAT WILL BE CREATED WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE DATE OF CANCELLATION. THE LIMITATION SECTION SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL TERMS REGARDING CANCELLATION OF YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION.
.
OmegaBrite may change the price for its products and its AutoRefill programs from time to time, and will communicate any changes in price to an existing and active AutoRefill program of yours to you in advance.
OmegaBrite has no obligation to communicate to you any price changes to its products unrelated to AutoRefill or to its AutoRefill products and programs that do not effect an existing and active AutoRefill program of yours. We may communicate these price changes to you via one or more of email, fax, mail, or telephone, at our sole discretion. For the purposes of these Terms, you agree that our communication to you of the price changes shall be deemed received five days after the date OmegaBrite sends you notice of the price change (not the date you receive such notice) (the “Notice Date”). The date of an applicable price change for an AutoRefill program will be the date that is exactly three months following the Notice Date. Price changes for AutoRefill programs will take effect starting with the order that is generated following the Subscription Period the date of the price change falls under. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Site and continuing to receive without cancelling your AutoRefill program orders after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your AutoRefill program per the cancellation terms and conditions set forth in these Terms, prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully. If you have or had an AutoRefill program that was deactivated for any reason, whether by your cancellation, issues relating to payment or credit card decline or expiration, or any other reason, OmegaBrite makes no guarantee that the price you were receiving will be the current and applicable price if and when you reactivate or open a new AutoRefill program, and, notwithstanding the foregoing, OmegaBrite is under no obligation to follow the notice procedure or timeline laid out above; instead, your reactivation or reopening of the AutoRefill program constitutes your acceptance of the price.

Dispute Resolution
Certain portions of this Section 10 are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and OmegaBrite agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement.
Arbitration.
If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:
.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
You and OmegaBrite agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and OmegaBrite arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with OmegaBrite as a user of the Site or OmegaBrite’s products or a customer of OmegaBrite (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, relating to any issue including without limitation relating to advertising and purchases, whether pre-existing, present or future, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding unto you and your successors and permitted assigns and to OmegaBrite and our successors and permitted assigns. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.
.
Exceptions
Notwithstanding clause 10.1.1. above, you and OmegaBrite both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court, (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S. federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
.
Arbitration Rules
Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in the United States, any arbitration between you and OmegaBrite will be finally settled under the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by the Terms. You and OmegaBrite agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, so the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. OmegaBrite can also help put you in touch with the AAA.Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Las Vegas, Nevada, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by OmegaBrite. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse OmegaBrite for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.If you are not located in, are not based in, do not have offices in, and do not do business in the United States, any arbitration between you and OmegaBrite will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) then in force (the “ICC Rules”) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.  Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the State of Nevada, United States, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.
.
Time for Filing
Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. The parties expressly waive any contrary statute of limitations or time bars, both legal and equitable, to any claim.
.
Notice; Process
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). OmegaBrite’s address for Notice is:
.
Omega Natural Science, Inc.
8275 S Eastern Avenue
Suite 121
Las Vegas, NV 89123, USA
.
The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or OmegaBrite may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or OmegaBrite shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, OmegaBrite shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by OmegaBrite in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. Except as required to enforce the arbitrator’s decision and award, neither you nor OmegaBrite shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.
.
Modifications
In the event that OmegaBrite makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to OmegaBrite’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to OmegaBrite’s address for Notice, in which case your account with OmegaBrite shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.
.
Enforceability
If the class action waiver at Section 10.3. is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if the entirety of this Section 10.1. is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10.1. shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15.2. shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms.
.
Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 will not apply to any legal action taken by OmegaBrite to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, and/or OmegaBrite’s intellectual property rights (including such OmegaBrite may claim that may be in dispute), OmegaBrite’s operations, and/or OmegaBrite’s products or services.
.
No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND OMEGABRITE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR ACTION OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. Unless both you and OmegaBrite agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 10.1. to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 15.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this “No Class Action Matters” section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.
.
Federal and State Courts in Clark County, Nevada. Except where arbitration is required above, small claims actions, or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Clark County, Nevada. Accordingly, you and OmegaBrite consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.
.
Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.

.
The foregoing limitations of liability will apply even if any of the foregoing events or circumstances were foreseeable and even if OmegaBrite Parties were advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses or damages, regardless of whether you bring an action based in contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort (including whether caused, in whole or in part, by negligence, acts of god, telecommunications failure, or destruction of the Site).
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages of the sort that are described above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OMEGABRITE PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID OMEGABRITE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION(S) THAT UNDERLIE THE CLAIM(S); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY IF A TRIBUNAL WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS SUCH TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.
.
OmegaBrite will make reasonable efforts to keep the Site operational. However, certain technical difficulties, maintenance, or other issues may, from time to time, result in temporary or even permanent interruptions. To the extent permissible under applicable law, OmegaBrite reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Site, with or without notice, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Site or any function or feature or product thereof.

Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief
IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.

Updates to Terms
These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SITE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted terms of service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The new terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the terms of service (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Site will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page, the page of the website displaying the Terms, your account and the email you associated with your account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.
