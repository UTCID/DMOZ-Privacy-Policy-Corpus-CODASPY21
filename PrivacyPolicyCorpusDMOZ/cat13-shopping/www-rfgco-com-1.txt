At RFG we are committed to protecting your privacy.
We use
the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide
a more personalized shopping experience.
Please read on for more
details about our privacy policy.
What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing
address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to
process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order
status.
We may also use the information we collect to
occasionally notify you about important functionality
changes to the Web site, new RFG services, and special offers we
think you'll find valuable.
RFG does not sell, trade, or rent your
personal
information to
others. We may choose to do so in the future
with trustworthy third
parties, but you can tell us not to by sending
an e-mail message.
(If you
use more than one e-mail address to shop
with us, send this message
from each e-mail account you use.)
Also,
RFG may provide
aggregate statistics about our customers,
sales, traffic patterns, and
related site information to reputable third-party
vendors, but these
statistics will include no personally identifying
information.
RFG may release account information when
we believe, in good faith,
that such release is reasonably necessary
to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce
or apply the terms of any of our user agreements
or (iii) protect the rights,
property or safety of RFG, our users, or
others.
We are committed to protecting your privacy.
We use the information we
collect on the site to make shopping at RFG
possible and to
enhance your overall shopping experience.
