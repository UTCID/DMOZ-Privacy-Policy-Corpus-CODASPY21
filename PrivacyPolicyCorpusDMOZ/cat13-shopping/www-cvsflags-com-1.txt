You know and trust CollinsFlags.com and we value your trust. We want you to know how we collect, use and protect information about our online guests.
What information about guests do we collect?

We receive and may store any information you enter on our website or give to our website in any other way. For example, we collect information you provide when you place an order or register with us. This information may include:
your name.

your credit card number.
It may also include any other personal or preference information you provide to us.
We will only store your credit card number until your order is processed.
We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email. This practice, called "phishing", is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond.
Automatic Information
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website. For example, we use "cookies" like many other websites. Through "cookies" we obtain information when your web browser accesses our website (see "What are 'Cookies' and how do we use them?" section below for details).
What are "Cookies" and how do we use them?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser.
Cookies allow us to provide features such as storage of items in your Cart between visits.
In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use cookies for reporting and analysis purposes such as how guests are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts and your response to those marketing efforts, and the delivery of relevant marketing messages.
Does our website share information it receives?
We share information we collect at our website within CollinsFlags.com Company. CollinsFlags.com may use this information to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.
Service Providers
Our website may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, mailing house or web host) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.
Safe Shopping Guarantee
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50.
