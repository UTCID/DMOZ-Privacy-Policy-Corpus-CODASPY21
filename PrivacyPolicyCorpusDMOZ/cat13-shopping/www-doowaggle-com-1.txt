In operating our store, it is essential for us to capture some information about your device, such as your IP address and information related to your visit when you browse our store. For example, this might include time-stamp, the last page or product you visited, the indication that you logged in. We do that in order to:

let you browse between products without having to start back from the home page at each click;

control that your data is processed securely.

Your privacy means a lot to us and we will stop sending you these communications right away.
