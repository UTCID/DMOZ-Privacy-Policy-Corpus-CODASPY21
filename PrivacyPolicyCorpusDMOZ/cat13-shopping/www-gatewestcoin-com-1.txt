"COOKIES."
A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser - along with a Web page - when you access a Web site. Your browser will
only return this cookie information to the domain where the cookie originated (in this case, gatewestcoin.com). No other site can request it.
When you return to this site, perhaps at a later date, the identifying cookie is sent back to the Web server, along with your new request.
For the security of our customers, and our systems, our site employs "SERVER-SIDE-COOKIES" which means the cookie is kept on our server, and not on your computer.
SECURITY AND ENCRYPTION.
This website is hosted on-site at our offices in Winnipeg, using the Apache webservice on Linux-based machines.
All transactions are encrypted using industry-standard 2048-bit encryption with certificates purchased from a root
authority.
All customer data containing anything other than the contact information (name, address, etc) is stored on a secured server on our local-area
network behind a firewall.
Credit card information is kept only on machines inside our local-area network behind a firewall as well, and is therefore unavailable to anyone outside of our firewall.
When browsing this website, you may notice that a message pops up saying that the page you are viewing contains both secure and
non-secure items.
Rest assured that your information is still be encrypted, and it still is secure.
The only information which is not encrypted
or secured are pictures and graphics stored on the page you are viewing.
This is to speed the loading and processing of the page you are viewing.
