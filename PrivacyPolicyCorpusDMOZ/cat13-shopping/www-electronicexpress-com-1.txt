Projector and Projector screens
25% restocking fee on return of any Projector and projector screens.
Appliances
All customers who live outside of our local delivery area of Middle Tennessee and North Alabama will receive correspondence regarding the Freight delivery process.
We also advise customers to measure before having an Appliance ship to their residence.
If the customer is confident, we will ship their product.
In the event the product does not fit, even after measuring, or are just not happy with their purchase, we ask they are packaged the way they have been received to prevent damage during return shipping.
To return an Appliance shipped with Freight Delivery, the item should be in like-new condition. When the carrier comes to pick up the Appliance, have it packaged in the original packaging and ready for pick-up.
In the event the Appliance arrives damaged, no return shipping cost will be incurred and an exchange or return will immediately be started.
Electronic Express requests that you inspect your Appliance for damage upon delivery and report any issue within 48 hours.
PLEASE SEE RETURN SHIPPING COST FOR FURTHER INFORMATION**
Note:
Electronic Express will not accept returns on products missing Serial Numbers and UPC’s
**Return Shipping Costs
If you return an item using a return shipping label we send to you via email (drop-off or pickup), and the reason for return is not a result of an Electronic Express error, the return shipping cost will be deducted from your refund.
The deduction of shipping fees applies to Freight Shipments as well.
If you receive a damaged product, please call or email us within 24-48 so that we may set up arrangements for return / exchange, as described above.
No return shipping cost will be incurred in this event.
Customer Refusals will result in the customer having to pay for the shipping cost to their residence and back to Electronic Express.
If Electronic Express received a notice to cancel the order prior to shipping, you will not be charged any shipping fees.
Restocking Fees
Electronic Express reserves the right to charge restocking fees in situations outlined above.
Whenever a product is returned and it is determined there is misuse, damage or neglect, based on the condition in which the product is received, a restocking fee will be determined.
It is our hope we never have to apply this type of additional charge.
