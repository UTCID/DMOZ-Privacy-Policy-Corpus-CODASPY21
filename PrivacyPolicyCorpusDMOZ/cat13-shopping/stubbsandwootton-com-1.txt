Returns are accepted within 30 days of receipt, utilizing enclosed return label.
Returned merchandise should be in the same condition as when you received it, unworn, undamaged, saleable, with original packaging.
Custom orders, pre-orders, trunk shows and items identified as "final sale" cannot be returned.
We are happy to honor requests for adjustment if your merchandise was purchased at regular price and then reduced within 7 days of purchase.
