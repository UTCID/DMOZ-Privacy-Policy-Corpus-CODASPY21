IV.  PRIVACY PRINCIPLES
CentroMotion commits to subject the Personal Information covered by this policy to the following principles:
(1)  NOTICE: Where CentroMotion collects Personal Information directly from individuals, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects, stores and processes Personal Information about them, the types of non-Agent third parties to which CentroMotion discloses that information, and the choices and means, if any, CentroMotion offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to CentroMotion, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before CentroMotion uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
(2)  CHOICE: CentroMotion will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-Agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
For Sensitive Personal Information, CentroMotion will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly consent (opt-in) to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
CentroMotion will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices should requisite circumstances arise.
(3)  DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION: CentroMotion will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. CentroMotion will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.
(4)  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER: CentroMotion uses third-party Agents to assist us in accomplishing the purposes described in this Policy, for example to support our customers, perform technical operations, and store and transmit data. CentroMotion will confirm that any third party to which it discloses Personal Information will appropriately safeguard the privacy of that Personal Information. Examples of appropriate privacy safeguards include: a contract obligating the third party to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant privacy principles, the third party being subject to EU data protection law, Privacy Shield certification by the third party, or the third party being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding (e.g., companies located in Switzerland). Where CentroMotion has knowledge that a third party is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Policy, CentroMotion will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. CentroMotion holds third parties to which it discloses Personal Information accountable for maintaining the trust our employees and customers place in the company. CentroMotion may remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if any Agent processes Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless CentroMotion first demonstrates that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
(5)  ACCESS AND CORRECTION: Upon request, CentroMotion will grant individuals reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition, CentroMotion will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any employees that desire to review or update their Personal Information can do so by contacting their local Human Resources Representative.
(6)  SECURITY: CentroMotion will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. CentroMotion protects data in many ways. Physical security is designed to prevent unauthorized access to database equipment and hard copies of sensitive Personal Information. Electronic security measures continuously monitor access to our servers and provide protection from hacking or other unauthorized access from remote locations. This protection includes the use of firewalls, restricted access and encryption technology. CentroMotion limits access to Personal Information and data to those persons in CentroMotion's organization, or as Agents of CentroMotion, that have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing such Personal Information and data. Individuals who have been granted access to Personal Information are aware of their responsibilities to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so.
(7)  RECOURSE, ENFORCEMENT, AND LIABILITY: CentroMotion will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify compliance with this Policy and the relevant privacy principles. Any employee that CentroMotion determines is in violation of this Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
