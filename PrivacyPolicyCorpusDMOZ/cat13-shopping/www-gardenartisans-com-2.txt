Return & Exchange Policy
RETURN and REFUND POLICY
We strive to do our best; however, if there is an error on your order, please accept our apologies, contact us upon receipt, and we will gladly correct our error. Damage claims should be made within 5 days. Open all packages upon receipt and inspect for damage.
If you have received your goods via truck freight or motor freight and there is damage to the packaging or item, if it is damage you can live with or repair to your satisfaction, please note it on the Bill of Lading before letting the truck driver leave your premises.  If the item is damaged beyond repair or you are not willing to have it repaired, refuse the shipment.  In either case, please contact us immediately to inform of damage.
Allowable returns carry a 30-day money back guarantee. All returns require an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number obtained by calling customer service. 410.672.0082.
Once a returned item is received in our warehouse, the return or exchange will be processed immediately. For credit card and Paypal orders, the refund will be made to your account within 72 hours. For check and money orders, you can expect to receive your refund check within 7-10 business days.
Examples of nonreturnable items:
1. Any item that is made or fabricated upon receipt of your order. An example of this is a concrete/sandstone planter.
2. Items that are non-stock items and ordered specifically for you. An example would be a garden arch from Agriframes that is in the landscape range or a fruit cage.
3. All custom and made-to-order products are nonreturnable.
Important:
Items must be returned in the original packaging and in condition for resale. If it is determined upon receipt of the returned item that we cannot put the item back on the shelf for resale, then a repacking and restocking fee will be calculated and applied to your refund.  No refunds are available for damaged goods.
A 25% restocking fee will apply to any free shipping item.
For your Consideration:
While a 6 foot garden arch may be returnable, it is always advised you measure twice and order once. Re-shipping large items is quite expensive and can result in damage if the item is not packed properly. Always, always insure items you return for damage. We cannot refund on a damaged item.
Return Address
Unless specifically instructed otherwise, all returns should be shipped or mailed, by a carrier of your choice, to:
Garden Artisans, LLC 451 Defense Hwy, Suite A Annapolis, MD 21401
We are always happy to discuss exchanges and returns with our customers and to help you through the process. You may reach us by phone 410.672.0082 or email: info@gardenartisans.com
