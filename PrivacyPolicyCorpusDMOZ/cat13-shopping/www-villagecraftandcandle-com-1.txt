Security Statement
Village Craft & Candle’s shopping cart is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the standard for encrypted commercial transactions throughout the Internet. Shop safely on-line for candles and supplies with Village Craft & Candle! SSL encrypts all personal information, including your name and credit card number, so that this information cannot be read as it travels through the Internet.
Only those web pages where you actually enter your credit card and billing information pass encrypted information. When you request one of these checkout screens, the page’s URL begins with https instead of http, and the “security” icon on your browser has the appearance of a closed padlock.
Privacy Statement
Village Craft & Candle does not collect or maintain any information about how you as an individual use our website. We analyze our web log statistics as a whole, but we do not track your browsing as an individual, and we do not share or offer this information to other companies.
Village Craft & Candle, like all companies that sell through a catalog or through an online store, maintains a list of current and potential customers.  We like to have email as well as postal addresses if possible. It’s our best way of staying in touch.
We recognize that you may or may not want to receive future offers. If you don’t want email from us, let us know and we will follow your wishes. If you’re an on-line customer, you can tell us your wishes here on this website, by clicking on My Account.
We do not rent or exchange email addresses or telephone numbers, and we have no plans to do so in the future. We maintain that information in our own records only so that we can contact you.
We do no “direct telemarketing” by telephone or fax, and we will never offer your name and phone number to any company that does. We occasionally call our customers to ask them how our service is. For example, we sometimes monitor the shippers we use to make sure that orders are delivered in a timely manner, and without damages. However, we do no telephone marketing, and we do not sell information to companies that do.
What if I don’t want e-mail promotions or newsletters?
If you’ve never ordered online, but you are already a customer of ours, please feel free to write us and let us know your wishes. Write to us at info@vccandle.com, or send us an ordinary letter. Although we try hard to avoid it, we sometimes end up with duplicate records for a customer.
What are cookies, and do you use them?
Cookies are bits of information that your browser stores on your computer to help a server (such as our website) communicate with you. These cookies are not accessible by any company other than our own website.
We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. When you visit vccandle.com, your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop at our site. If you are a Preferred Customer, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. We may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions.
We also use cookies to track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to ours to further improve our site design and to fulfill contracts with our business partners. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web sites.
Although there are firms that track Internet users via cookies, we do not buy, sell, exchange, or offer this information to them. Nor do we use any such information on our own site.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a Preferred Customer to allow you access to your account information.
If you are concerned about cookies, and you want to avoid keeping them on your machine, we urge you to use or purchase one of the many excellent “Cookie Eliminator” programs that are available. Other than forcing you to log in again, using a cookie cleaning program will not affect your use of our site.
What other information do you collect?
As you browse and order on our site, our servers log your activity and your path through our site, recording each request for a page or other information. Village Craft & Candle collects and analyzes data about how visitors use this website, but we do not use this information to identify or contact individual users, nor do we supply any data that could identify individual users to a third party. We use this data only to improve our site and our services. We do nothing with this information, other than analyze it in aggregate, or diagnose occasional problems.
