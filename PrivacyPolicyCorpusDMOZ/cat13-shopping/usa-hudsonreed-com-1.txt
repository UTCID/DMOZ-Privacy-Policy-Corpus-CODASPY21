1. Use of this site
This Site is provided to you free of charge for your personal use subject to these Terms. By using this Site you agree to be bound by these Terms.
All orders and purchases made on this Site will also be governed by these Terms and will be between you and Hudson Reed. Your contract will not under any circumstances be with any other party, including any retailer whose web site may have directed you to this Site.
THESE TERMS DO NOT AFFECT YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS
2. Prices
The prices payable for the items that you order are clearly set out in the web site. If, by mistake, we have under-priced an item, we will not be liable to supply that item to you at the stated price, provided that we notify you before we dispatch the item concerned. All prices are in US Dollars, and include free delivery to the contiguous United States. Prices exclude any local taxes that may fall due. Shipping surcharges may apply to addresses in Alaska, Hawaii and other offshore locations, and orders to Canada will incur a fee for shipping, duties and taxes. This fee will be displayed prior to checkout, and may vary according to the contents of the order.
3. Availability
If for any reason beyond our reasonable control, we are unable to supply a particular item, we will notify you as soon as possible.
4. Delivery and Acceptance
There will be no contract of any kind between you and us unless and until we actually dispatch the goods to you. At any point up until then, we may decline to supply the goods to you without giving any reason. At the moment that we accept your order, by dispatching the goods (and not before), a contract will be made between you and us. If we decline to supply goods and payment has already been taken from your credit or debit card, we shall credit your credit or debit card with the price of the goods within 30 days of declining your order. We shall not be obliged to offer you any additional compensation for disappointment suffered.
If there is a problem with your order in terms of availability of the goods or our ability to deliver, we shall contact you by telephone or email as soon as reasonably practicable.
If the goods that you ordered are not available, we reserve the right to substitute goods of a similar specification and quality.
Delivery will be made to the address specified by you on the completed order form. Once goods have been delivered to you they will be held at your risk and we will not be liable for their loss or destruction.
All deliveries are by third party carriers. If you are not able to take delivery of the products, depending on the carrier used, your goods will either be stored at the depot nearest to your address until you can collect them or the carrier will attempt to redeliver the goods to your address.
We shall use our best endeavours to secure delivery within 30 days of receipt by us of your order but shall not be liable for loss occasioned by delay in delivery arising out of any cause beyond our control.
If you order items with different availability dates, we will hold all the items until the last item is delivered. You may however choose to have each item delivered separately and we reserve the right to charge you a delivery charge each time.
If our couriers cannot make a delivery you will be contacted by both ourselves and the couriers to arrange a re-delivery or pick up.
If you do not respond and the items are returned to ourselves you may be subject to a charge. If the item needs re-delivering there will also be a re-delivery charge.
Photographs may be asked for as form of identifying any issues with the order.
Non-Pallet Items - Please inspect the products within 21 days of the product arriving. We reserve the right to replace the goods if an inspection has not been carried out within this period of time.
Items on a Pallet - Please inspect the products within 30 days of the product arriving. We reserve the right to replace the goods if an inspection has not been carried out within this period of time.
5. Cancellation
You have the right to cancel your order up to 7 working days after the day following the delivery by contacting us using our online customer support. Alternatively, you can cancel your order by post:
Post Hudson Reed Unit 1 & 2 Dawson Court Billington Road Burnley Lancashire England BB11 5UB
If the goods have already been dispatched at the date of receipt of your cancellation of the order you must return the goods to us in accordance with paragraph 7 below and we will credit your credit or debit card with the price of the goods within 30 days beginning with the day on which notice of cancellation was given.
If you do not return the goods within 21 days of your cancellation, we will make a charge in respect of the cost of recovering the goods. If you do not return the goods or fail to make them available for collection within 30 days of your notice of cancellation, you will be deemed to have accepted the goods, at which point a new purchase contract will be made and you will be charged for your order at the price set out on the web site. This does not affect your statutory rights.
6. Returns
To return an item simply login to your account and select the "My Orders" link in the left navigation. If you don't have an account you can register by clicking the "Register" link at the top right of the screen.
Click "View Order" and then proceed to click the "Return" link at the top right of the page.
If the customer is having an item collected for return, the customer is responsible to ensure that the correct goods are given to the courier driver. We cannot be held responsible if the incorrect items are offered to the courier company. Nor can we ensure a safe return of the incorrect goods supplied.
7. Payment
You can pay by any American Express, Mastercard or Visa credit card and PayPal. Your credit card details will be encrypted to minimise the possibility of unauthorised access or disclosure. Authority for payment must be given at the time of order.
Our liability to you in connection with any order will not exceed the total price charged for the goods.
