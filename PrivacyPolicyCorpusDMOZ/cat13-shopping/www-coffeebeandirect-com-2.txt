Product Backorders
We work closely to ensure that items which are out-of-stock at our vendors are shown as such on the Website.

If that happens, as soon as we learn of the backorder status from the vendor we will give you a choice between a full immediate refund and a delayed shipment.
Availability
Products that are not available are marked accordingly on the product pages. If you place an order for a product that is shown as available but in fact is not available, we will provide you with a full refund.
Risk of Loss
Items purchased from the Website which are subject to physical delivery are made pursuant to a shipment contract.

Your subscription will remain in effect until it is cancelled. You can cancel at any time via your Coffee Bean Direct account page, which can be found at https://www.coffeebeandirect.com/subscriptions/mysubscriptions. If you cancel your subscription and then reactivate it, the discount applied to any Subscription item may not be the same discount in effect at the time of cancellation. If the Subscription discount percentage for such Subscription item changes, the new discount will be applied to your future shipments of that item.
