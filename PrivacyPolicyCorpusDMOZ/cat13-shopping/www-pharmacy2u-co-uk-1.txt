We may also disclose information collected for these purposes with our professional advisors such as medical advisors, and security advisors, couriers, and Royal Mail.
Orders, medications, and prescriptions
We collect, store, and use information about orders placed with us. You may place orders for medications and other products on our website, via our app, by email, web chat and over the phone. Because medications can be dangerous, we only take orders from account holders about whom we have collected relevant medical and personal information. When you place an order with us, we will ask you a series of questions to verify your identity. Once we are satisfied that we have verified your identity, you may submit an order with us providing information about the medications you require and other data concerning your health.

This type of information is shared with the NHS and your GP and organisations we use to check, dispatch, and take payment for your order. We may also disclose information collected for these purposes with our professional advisors such as medical advisors, and security advisors. We collect customer reviews using specialist third party services including Feefo and Trustpilot in pursuit of our interests of promoting our services and in the interests of our customers to provide them with a mechanism for rating the quality of service they received and/or raise service issues with us. We will only give Trustpilot your email address, so they can ask you to leave a review. Customer reviews are retained for as long as the reviewer wishes (or deleted if they are deemed incorrect or fraudulent). Trustpilot and their sub processors may carry out data transfers, however data processing agreements are in place, which contain EU SCCs with all sub-processors located outside the EEA and they are reinforced by additional safeguards.
Callers
You might telephone us for a variety of purposes. We will record the call and we may make notes on our system about the call.
More information
The law allows us to collect and use this information in pursuit of our legitimate interests of operating a business and to respond to any enquiry or complaint you might make. We record calls for the purpose of monitoring our call handlers and providing appropriate training for them and to keep an accurate record of what was said during a telephone conversation in the event of further issues or complaint. We may use call recordings or transcripts of them to defend ourselves in the event of legal, regulatory, or similar action. We retain call recordings for 6 months or until they are no longer needed by us.
Profiling and segmentation
We use the information marked with an asterisk (*) in the sections above to profile our customers and segment our database:
To help us to understand our customers and to help us identify and market to customers with similar characteristics.
To enable us to determine if our other products and services or those of our sister company Chemist Direct are likely to be of interest to you.
To enable us to determine if products and services of other organisations are likely to be of interest to you.
To enable us to determine if you are likely to be suitable to take part in clinical trials and medical research we may be involved with from time to time (please refer to the section below).
To determine if our products and services of other organisations similar products and services may be of interest to you.
More information
The law allows us to collect and use this information in pursuit of our legitimate interests of operating and developing our commercial pharmacy services. We do not use any medical data, information about your health, or any other special categories of personal data for profiling and segmentation except in relation to the provision of healthcare and treatment such as establishing if you require flu jabs, vaccinations, eligibility for condition specific information, or clinical trials (please refer to the section below). We will use information about the products and services you order for profiling.
We retain database segmentation and customer profile information only for the period we need it which is generally only as long as you have an account with us. This type of information is shared with our professional advisors such as marketing agencies. We may also disclose anonymised information about our customers to sponsors and providers of clinical trials and medical research and our medical advisors. Any information that we disclose in this way is anonymised so that individuals cannot be identified from it.
Clinical research, medical trials and studies and automated decision-making
As a respected medical business, we are often approached by other professional organisations looking for people to participate in medical research, clinical trials of new treatments for example, or other medical studies. We believe that it is vitally important such trials take place and aim to support them as far as we can.
This is how we determine if you would be a suitable participant in a clinical trial.
Sponsors of trials approach us with a profile of people they are seeking to participate. This may include information such as gender, age band, geographic location and details of health conditions or medications they are researching.
We will look at our database of patients to find people who meet the participant profile using the information we hold about each patient.
We will provide all those individuals who have been identified as suitable to participate in a trial with information about it and will, subject always to consent, disclose their contact information to the trial sponsor.
It will always be entirely your decision whether or not to participate in a clinical trial. Your decision will not have any effect on the services we provide to you. We wont disclose any information about you which allows you to be identified to any trial sponsor without your explicit consent.
More information
The law allows us to undertake profiling and automated decision making in pursuit of our interests of promoting our business as a leading provider of pharmaceutical services and maintaining a database of patients for our commercial benefit. The law also allows us to undertake this type of processing to support the interests of sponsors of clinical trials and research. The law (Data Protection Act 2018 Section 19, and Schedule 1 Section 2 and Section 4) permits us to use medical data and health information for the listed purposes as it is necessary for medical research, and the provision of health care/treatment. The UK introduced a national data opt-out (https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out) in May 2018 whereby all UK NHS patients were automatically opted in to a scheme allowing NHS organisations to share patient information for the purposes of research and planning. You may choose to opt-out. For further information please visit https://www.nhs.uk/your-nhs-data-matters/manage-your-choice.
We may process your data to help us identify patients based on the clinical trial eligibility criteria of the specific trial. The automated decision making that we undertake does not have any legal or other similarly significant effect on our patients because every decision is reviewed by a suitable person before being implemented. What this means is that we will not make decisions about you which are wholly determined by computers alone.
You have the right to object to any processing that is based on our claim of our legitimate interests including profiling and automated decision making as outlined in the Your Rights section below.
We retain information about which clinical trials we think you are suitable for and the basis of our decision making only for as long as we need it. The high-level profile information is shared with clinical research companies to allow them to determine if we are likely to have any suitable research/trial candidates. We will ordinarily only disclose information about those people who meet the trial person profile specification with explicit consent unless the research program is so generic that it does not require the disclosure of any data concerning health in which case we may choose to disclose a list of candidates on the basis of the legitimate interests of the trial sponsor. We may also disclose information about our customers participation in clinical trials and medical research to our professional and medical advisors.
Marketing
Pharmacy2U is a commercial business and our success is based not only on the trust of our customers but on adopting a responsible approach to marketing. We use the information we hold about our customers for direct marketing purposes including sending direct marketing materials about our products and services that we believe may be of interest to you via mail, email, SMS, and through telemarketing. We also may customise the adverts you see on our website. Usually, adverts are customised through automated decision making, based on the pages you have visited on our site previously. As part of our clinical responsibility to patients we may also send you emails if you only partially complete a prescription order on our website or app.
More information
The law allows us to undertake direct marketing in pursuit of our interests of promoting our business. You may object to our using information about you for direct marketing purposes as outlined in the Your Rights section below.

We maintain records of consent: you may withdraw your consent at any time.
When we undertake direct marketing by telephone, we will always check whether you are registered on the telephone preference service (TPS), the UKs register of numbers that may not be used for telephone marketing.
We retain information about your interaction with our direct marketing activities only for as long as we need it which is generally no longer than 2 years from the end of a campaign. We may retain anonymised campaign statistics for a longer period of time to allow us to monitor our direct marketing activities year-on-year. Like many organisations, we use specialist service providers to help us to carry out our direct marketing including marketing agencies, printing and mailing companies, email/SMS broadcasting providers, telephone marketing agencies and other similar professional advisors which means information about you may be disclosed to them.
When we undertake customer surveys or email broadcasting, we may use specialist services providers in other countries including for example SurveyMonkey and Sailthru both of which are based in the USA. Whenever we transfer information about you overseas, we will make sure that we implement suitable safeguards including for example using appropriate contracts which hold our suppliers to account and provide protection to your rights and freedoms.

We also use the information we hold to undertake direct marketing activities on behalf of other organisations, including the NHS.

Social Media
We may obtain information about you from social media channels including Facebook and Twitter. We use content aggregators such as Hootsuite to manage social media content that refers to us so that we can monitor market sentiment towards our brand and address any complaints or brand issues raised on social media.
We may also process your data in order to identify people like you to send them marketing information. Should we use your data in this way your personal information will be anonymised.
If you have consented to marketing, we may use your personal data to generate targeted marketing on social media sites, for example Facebook. We send pseudonymised data in a way that only the intended end user can understand. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on social media platforms. If you do not wish to receive such targeted marketing generally, you are able to switch this off within the social media site.
More information
The law allows us to undertake the listed activities on the basis of our legitimate interests of protecting and developing our business. We retain information on our social media pages and aggregators for no more than 2 years. Some of the social media channels we use transfer personal data to the USA. Whenever we transfer information about you overseas, we will make sure that we implement suitable safeguards including for example using appropriate contracts which hold our suppliers to account and provide protection to your rights and freedoms. For further information about international transfers of personal data please contact our Data Protection Officer.
Other Processing
