Privacy Policy
As with all shopping websites, we collect personal information from you when you shop online at www.pennyplain.com. We use this information to make your shopping experience as easy and enjoyable as possible.
The information we collect is:
Your name – so we know what to call you.
Email address – so we can email your order confirmations, delivery delays, offers etc.
Delivery address – an obvious one.
Telephone number – we’ll only call if we have a delivery problem or to talk to you about your order.
Credit card details – we only ask for these when you place an order, and the data is fully encrypted and never seen by us.
Mobile number – so we can call you with details about your orders or where we have a question.
We use the latest secure server technology to ensure this information is protected to the highest standards.
We use encryption to safeguard your credit card information and only accept orders from web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection. Most web browsers above version three support this security.
This encryption makes it virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read any information that you send us.
The encryption technique we use is the highest standard available for e-commerce and certified by AlphaSSL.
Deleting your account
You can have your data removed at any time by signing in to your account and selecting ‘Delete Account’ from the left-hand menu. You can unsubscribe from the Newsletter by clicking the ‘Unsubscribe’ button at the bottom of the emails we send. Please allow 10 days for your request to be updated across all our systems.
Data protection
Penny Plain is a controller under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will never pass on your details to third parties for marketing purposes.
There are only two circumstances where we may share some of your data with others:
With agents (including credit reference agencies, credit card clearing agencies (Barclays Merchant Services in UK and Payment Tech in USA), fraud prevention and detection agencies, delivery companies and data processing analysts) that we use to process the orders you place with us or who assist us in the service we provide to you. In these instances, we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function.
In the unlikely event that our business assets are ever sold to or purchased by another company (our data records are part of our business).
If you have questions about your personal data or our privacy policy, please contact us at web@pennyplain.com

Cookies
Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card. They let the website know when the user has returned. This lets the site bring up information relevant to that user, for example your name, past orders etc. Cookies make the interaction between users and websites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a website to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping bag or to remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit. The Penny Plain  website uses cookies to allow customers to move from one part of the website to another and to add items to the shopping bag without having to login repeatedly. Cookies are not computer programs and can't read other information saved on your hard drive. They cannot be used to disseminate viruses, or get a user's email address etc. They only contain and transfer to the website as much information as the users themselves have disclosed to that website. It is possible to opt out of cookies via your browser’s cookie settings, but if you do this you will not be able to shop from the Penny Plain website as the functions of the website are dependent on cookies. Please note that cookies are computer specific, so if you log on to any site from a different computer, the cookie settings on that computer will apply.
For further information about managing and disabling cookies on your computer see www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies. When you visit our site, cookies are either served directly by us, or by our business partners. Here is a description of the different kind of cookies we use:
Essential cookies:
These cookies allow you to use the basic functionality of our website. For example, browsing our products, ordering and paying for items, checking your account information and viewing your order history.
Performance cookies:
They allow us to get to know how you use our website. They are used to analyse visitor information such as usage, visitor numbers and help us see how effective our advertising is and to understand what you like. We also use this information to help improve our website, make our marketing more relevant and improve the user experience.
Functionality cookies:
They allow us to provide additional functionalities to the website and will retain some settings information. Whilst not essential for the functionality of our site, they do enable extra features that should improve your shopping experience.
Targeting cookies:
We also use cookies to track visitors' interest in our products. We may use this to understand what most appeals to our customers, so we can make our offers as appropriate as possible.
