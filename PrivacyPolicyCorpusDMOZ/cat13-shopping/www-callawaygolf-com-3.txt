Legal Terms and Conditions
Welcome to the Callaway Golf Company website (the "Site"). Like the game of golf, this Site has certain rules that you must follow during your visit ("Rules"). Please read these Rules carefully before beginning your tour. Most of all, have fun while you discover what Callaway Golf is all about.

Please check back periodically for changes. The Rules were last updated on June 27, 2016. There have been no changes since that date. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these Rules will mean you accept those changes and that they apply to you.

Products displayed on this Site can be found at authorized Callaway Golf Retail Locations near you, while supplies last. Please connect to our Retail Locator to find the authorized retail location nearest you. We have done our best to display the true colors of the products found on this Site; however, colors may vary due to the settings of your computer monitor.
SITE OPERATION:
Callaway Golf controls and operates this Site from its headquarters in Carlsbad, California, United States of America and makes no representation that these materials are appropriate for use in other locations. If you use this Site from other locations you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export or re-export the materials at this Site or any copy or adaptation in violation of any applicable laws or regulations including without limitation U.S. export laws and regulations.
GOVERNING LAW:
These Rules and your use of the Site will be governed by the laws of the State of California, as applied to contracts entered into between California residents and performed in California. Any disputes arising out of these Rules or your use of the Site not subject to Binding Arbitration will be heard only in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California, USA, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
BINDING ARBITRATION:
You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site, use of the Site, and/or these Rules shall be settled by binding arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration against Callaway Golf, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees. In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, Callaway Golf will pay as much of the claimant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Callaway Golf shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.
BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL. DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.
INTERPRETATION:
If any provision of these Rules is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. These Rules (and the links contained herein) state the entire agreement between the parties relating to use of the Site. The Rules may not be amended except as provided above.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:
Statements contained on this Site regarding Callaway Golf's business which are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that are based upon information and expectations at the time they were first made or posted.  Actual results may differ materially as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.

2-Year Warranty
Callaway Products are Backed for Two Years
Warranty Coverage: Except as otherwise stated on the product or packaging, Callaway Golf Company warrants its golf clubs, components, and other products purchased from an authorized Callaway Golf retailer or distributor to be free of defects in material and workmanship for two years. Callaway Golf will, without charge to the consumer, repair or replace any product or component or part thereof that is defective or becomes defective during normal use within two years after the date of purchase from an authorized Callaway Golf retailer or distributor. At its option, Callaway Golf may replace the product with a new or refurbished product. Callaway Golf does not warrant its products against damage caused by third parties. This warranty does not cover paint scratches, cosmetic blemishes or other normal wear and tear. Callaway Golf will fix such blemishes and scratches, however, for a fee. To obtain warranty service in the United States on a complete Callaway Golf product, return the product to a Callaway Golf authorized retailer or directly to Callaway Golf. In the case of a Callaway Golf component, you must obtain warranty service through an authorized Callaway Golf retailer of that component. Outside of the United States, all warranty service must be obtained from the distributor or subsidiary in the country in which the club was purchased. To determine the Callaway Golf authorized retailer, distributor or subsidiary nearest you, check our website at www.callawaygolf.com or contact Callaway Golf directly. In California call collect 760-931-1771; outside California call toll free 1-800-588-9836.
Disclaimer: This warranty is in lieu of all other express warranties. Callaway Golf disclaims all warranties for products that are purchased from sellers other than authorized retailers or distributors, including the warranty of merchantability or the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Callaway Golf also disclaims any implied warranty, including the warranty of merchantability or the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and assumes no responsibility for any special, incidental, or consequential damages as to all products and components. Callaway Golf further disclaims any implied or express warranty of, and assumes no responsibility for, defects in workmanship caused by third parties. This warranty gives the consumer specific legal rights; a consumer may have other rights depending upon where he or she lives. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of special, incidental or consequential damages, or limitations on how long a warranty lasts, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to everyone. Outside of the United States, local taxes, tariffs or shipping charges may apply. This warranty does not apply to Callaway Golf® or Odyssey® golf clubs purchased in Australia or New Zealand on or after January 1, 2011. For warranty information for purchases made in Australia and New Zealand on or after that date, see the South Pacific warranty. The above warranty also does not apply to upro gps devices or accessories.
