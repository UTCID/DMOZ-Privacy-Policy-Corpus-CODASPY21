Returns & Exchanges
Our Return Policy is designed to be fair and upright, so that we may offer you the widest selection of hard-to-find musical items at a reasonable cost with low-cost speedy delivery. As such, it may be different from those of some other retailers, therefore please take a moment to become familiar with it.
All returns or exchanges must occur within 30 days of the original invoice and must be accompanied by a copy of the invoice and a Return Form or a note explaining the reason for the return.
Be sure to always include a copy of your invoice—returns received without invoice copies may not be credited or credited correctly. You do not need a Return Authorization (R/A) number before sending your return. If you are uncertain of whether you are allowed to return an item, please contact us first before sending it back. Any item returned in violation of this policy will not be credited and may be refused and sent back to you.
Music  Music is not returnable or exchangeable unless there is a printing error or we shipped the wrong item to you (except for Half & Half Trials—see above). We can not take back music because it is not satisfactory or is not what you expected, or because it is too easy or too hard. In the case of defective music, we will exchange your defective copy for a corrected version if possible. We will only issue a refund or credit if a corrected copy is no longer available. Music returned must be in mint condition with no markings whatsoever.
Accessories  Accessories are returnable if they and their packaging are unused and in mint condition. Accessories that arrive with themselves or their packaging damaged will be credited at a lesser value than when sold.
CDs  CDs are returnable only if they are still in their original, unbroken shrink wrap. Defective CDs can of course be returned, and will be exchanged for new ones. CDs may not be returned because they are not what you expected or because you don't like the performance.
Software  Software is returnable only if the item was sent in error and the shrink wrap is unbroken.
Software that has damaged or defective media (disks) can be exchanged for undamaged only. No refunds will be issued for damaged or defective media unless a replacement is unavailable. Software that has "bugs," does not work on your system, or is otherwise found to be unsuitable is not considered defective and can not be returned.
In cases of defective or erroneous merchandise, we will also refund your shipping charges if the original shipping charges pertained to only the returned item. In cases where you are returning an item for reasons other than defect or error, we will credit your account for the cost of the item only, minus shipping charges. This is our general policy regarding returns and exchanges. There may be exceptions or circumstances unforseen at the time of this writing. In those cases we will do what is fair and appropriate to remedy the situation.
We appreciate your cooperation with us in regards to this and other policies outlined on this page. These policies have been instituted so that we may offer you the widest selection of hard-to-find musical items at a reasonable cost with fast delivery. While a more liberal return policy might be initially appealing, it would seriously affect our ability to offer you the wide range of products you will find here.

Trial Periods
We offer trial periods on in-stock music, mouthpieces and instruments. You may try a maximum of three in-stock mouthpieces, one in-stock instrument or $1,000 worth of music for up to ten days. We can not allow trials on out-of-stock or special-order music, mouthpieces or instruments.
How it Works:
We'll sell you the item(s) you wish to try. You have the right to return any trial item within ten (10) days of receiving it (see exception below for music). Upon arrival in our store, we will issue a refund of the purchase price less the outgoing shipping cost, plus any clean-up fees or damage assessments (see below). The cost of return shipping is yours—we regret that we can not provide free return labels for trials.
Mouthpieces:
When we receive your return, we will credit your credit card, less the original shipping charge and a $5 per-item clean-up fee. All mouthpieces should be rinsed out and wiped down prior to return. Woodwind players—please use a patch during the trial to prevent teeth marks. Returned mouthpieces must be free of patches and have no marks whatsoever as a result of the trial. Brass players—please be careful of causing excessive scratching of the shank. For all mouthpieces, boxes must be clean, straight and in resalable condition with all parts included. Please be careful when unwrapping and testing to avoid additional charges. If damage is evident, the loss of value to the mouthpiece will be deducted from your refund.
Instruments:
When we receive your return, we will credit your credit card, less $75 or our cost of shipping the instrument to you, whichever is greater. There is no clean-up fee. The instrument must be in exactly the same condition as when it left our store. If new damage is evident, the cost of repairs and/or the loss of value to the instrument will be deducted from your refund. Instruments are shipped to you expertly packed and fully insured, and must be returned in the same manner. Any damage sustained during the return will be your responsibility to rectify.
Music:
We now offer a "Half & Half" program for music trials. Under this program, you may purchase a quantity of music totaling $250 to $1,000, with the right to return up to half of it within a trial period of ten days. Returned music must be neat, clean and unmarked to receive return credit. No copies of any sort whatsoever may be made during the trial period (we have a way of knowing, so don't try it). Credit for returned music will made in the form of a refund to your credit card.
Other Stuff:
We regret that we can not allow trials of CDs, DVDs or software due to copyright issues. Mouth instruments (recorders, harmonicas, etc.) can not be sold on a trial basis for reasons of hygene.

Woodwind Instrumentation Codes
Following many of the titles in our Wind Ensemble catalog, you will see a set of numbers enclosed in square brackets, as in this example:
Description
Price
Rimsky-KorsakovQuintet in Bb [1011-1 w/piano]Item: 26746
$28.75
The bracketed numbers tell you the precise instrumentation of the ensemble. The first number stands for Flute, the second for Oboe, the third for Clarinet, the fourth for Bassoon, and the fifth (separated from the woodwinds by a dash) is for Horn. Any additional instruments (Piano in this example) are indicated by "w/" (meaning "with") or by using a plus sign.
Flute   Oboe   Clarinet   Bassoon   —   Horn
This woodwind quartet is for 1 Flute, no Oboe, 1 Clarinet, 1 Bassoon, 1 Horn and Piano.
Sometimes there are instruments in the ensemble other than those shown above. These are linked to their respective principal instruments with either a "d" if the same player doubles the instrument, or a "+" if an extra player is required. Whenever this occurs, we will separate the first four digits with commas for clarity. Thus a double reed quartet of 2 oboes, english horn and bassoon will look like this:
0,2+1,0,1-0
Note the "2+1" portion means "2 oboes plus english horn"
Titles with no bracketed numbers are assumed to use "Standard Instrumentation."
The following is considered to be Standard Instrumentation:
Duo - Flute & Clarinet - or [1010-0]
Trio - Flute, Oboe & Clarinet - or [1110-0]
Quartet - Flute, Oboe, Clarinet & Bassoon - or [1111-0]
Quintet - Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon & Horn - [or 1111-1]
Brass Instrumentation Codes
Following many of the titles in our Brass Ensemble catalog, you will see a set of five numbers enclosed in square brackets, as in this example:
Description
Price
CoplandFanfare for the Common Man [343.01 w/tympani]Item: 02158
$14.95
The bracketed numbers tell you how many of each instrument are in the ensemble. The first number stands for Trumpet, the second for Horn, the third for Trombone, the fourth (separated from the first three by a dot) for Euphonium and the fifth for Tuba.
Any additional instruments (Tympani in this example) are indicated by a "w/" (meaning "with") or by using a plus sign.
Trumpet     Horn     Trombone   .   Euphonium     Tuba
Thus, the Copland Fanfare shown above is for 3 Trumpets, 4 Horns, 3 Trombones, no Euphonium, 1 Tuba and Tympani. There is no separate number for Bass Trombone, but it can generally be assumed that if there are multiple Trombone parts, the lowest part can/should be performed on Bass Trombone.
Titles listed in our catalog without bracketed numbers are assumed to use "Standard Instrumentation."
The following is considered to be Standard Instrumentation:
Brass Duo - Trumpet & Trombone, or [101.00]
Brass Trio - Trumpet, Horn & Trombone, or [111.00]
Brass Quartet - 2 Trumpets, Horn & Trombone, or [211.00]
Brass Quintet - 2 Trumpets, Horn, Trombone & Tuba, or [211.01]
Brass Sextet and greater - No Standard Instrumentaion
People often ask us about "PJBE" or "Philip Jones" instrumentation.
This is a special instrumentation adopted and perfected by the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble.
It consists of the forces 414.01, and often includes Percussion and/or Tympani.
In addition, there are often doublings in the Trumpet section
- Piccolo and Flugelhorn being the most common.
While this instrumentation has come to be common, it is still not "Standard" as many Brass Dectets use very different forces, most often with more Horns than PJBE.
String Instrumentation Codes
Following many of the titles in our String Ensemble catalog, you will see a set of four numbers enclosed in square brackets, as in this example:
Description
Price
AtwellVance's Dance [0220]Item: 32599
$8.95
These numbers tell you how many of each instrument are in the ensemble.
The first number stands for Violin, the second for Viola, the third for Cello, and the fourth for Double Bass.
Thus, this string quartet is for 2 Violas and 2 Cellos, rather than the usual 2110.
Titles with no bracketed numbers are assumed to use "Standard Instrumentation."
The following is considered to be Standard Instrumentation:
String Duo - Viola & Viola - [1100]
String Trio - Violin, Viola, Cello - [1110]
String Quartet - 2 Violins, Viola, Cello - [2110]
String Quintet - 2 Violins, Viola, Cello, Bass - [2111]
Orchestra & Band Instrumentation Codes
Following some titles in our Orchestra & Band catalogs, you will see a numeric code enclosed in square brackets, as in these examples:
Order Qty
Description
Price
BeethovenSymphony No 1 in C, op 21
[2,2,2,2-2,2,0,0, tymp, 44322]
$150.00
JonesWind Band Overture [2+1,1,3+ac+bc,2,SATB-2+2,4,3+1,1, tymp, percussion, double bass]
$85.00
MacKenzieHines Pond Fantasy (DePaolo)
[2d1+1,1,2+1,1-2,2(+2),3,0, perc, tymp, 44322, Eb clarinet, SAATB saxes, trombone solo]
$75.00
The bracketed numbers tell you the precise instrumentation of the ensemble. The system used above is standard in the orchestra music field. The first set of numbers (before the dash) represent the Woodwinds. The set of numbers after the dash represent the Brass. Percussion is abbreviated following the brass. Strings are represented with a series of five digits representing the quantity of each part
(first violin, second violin, viola, cello, bass). Other Required and Solo parts follow the strings:
Woodwinds—Brass,   Percussion,   Strings,   Other
Principal auxilary instruments (piccolo, english horn, bass clarinet, contrabassoon, wagner tuba, cornet & euphonium) are linked to their respective instruments with either a "d" if the same player doubles the auxiliary instrument, or a "+" if an extra player is required. Instruments shown in parenthesis are optional and may be omitted.
Example 1 - Beethoven:
[2,2,2,2-2,2,0,0, tymp, 44322]
The Beethoven example is typical of much Classical and early Romantic fare. In this case, the winds are all doubled (2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets and 2 bassoons), and there are two each horns and trumpets. There is no low brass. There is tympani.
Strings are a standard 44322 configuration (4 first violin, 4 second violin, 3 viola, 2 cello, 2 bass).
Sometimes strings are simply listed as "str," which means 44322 strings.
Example 2 - Jones: (concert band/wind ensemble example)
[2+1,1,3+ac+bc,2,SAATB-2+2,4,3+1,1, tymp, percussion, double bass]
The second example is common for a concert band or wind ensemble piece.
This ficticious work is for 2 flutes (plus piccolo), 1 oboe, 3 clarinets plus alto and bass clarinets, 2 bassoons, 5 saxes (soprano, 2 altos, tenor & bari), 2 trumpets (plus 2 cornets), 3 trombones, euphonium, tuba, tympani, percussion and double bass. Note the inclusion of the saxes after bassoon for this band work. Note also that the separate euphonium part is attached to trombone with a plus sign. For orchestral music, saxes are at the end (see Saxophones below. It is highly typical of band sets to have multiple copies of parts, especially flute, clarinet, sax, trumpet, trombone & percussion. Multiples, if any, are not shown in this system. The numbers represent only distinct parts, not the number of copies of a part.
Example 3 - MacKenzie: (a fictional work, by the way).
[2d1+1,1,2+1,1-2,2(+2),3,0, perc, tymp, 66432, Eb clarinet, SAATB saxes, trombone solo]
In the third example, we have a rather extreme use of the system. It is an orchestral work for piccolo, 2 flutes (1 of whom doubles on piccolo), 1 oboe, 2 clarinets plus an additional bass clarinet, 1 bassoon, 2 horns, 2 trumpets (plus an optional 2 cornets), 3 trombones, no tuba, percussion, tympani, 6 first violins, 6 second violins, 4 violas, 3 cellos, 2 double basses, Eb clarinet (as an additional chair, not doubled), 5 saxes (soprano, 2 alto, tenor & baritone) & a trombone soloist.
Note: This system lists Horn before Trumpet. This is standard orchestral nomenclature. Unless otherwise noted, we will use this system for both orchestra and band works (in most band scores, Trumpet precedes Horn, and sometimes Oboe & Bassoon follow Clarinet). Also, it should be noted that Euphonium can be doubled by either Trombone or Tuba. Typically, orchestra scores have the tuba linked to euphonium, but it does happen where Trombone is the principal instead.
Saxophones, when included in orchestral music (they rarely are) will be shown in the "other instrument" location after strings and before the soloist, if any. However for band music, they are commonly present and therefore will be indicated after bassoon as something similar to "SAATB" where S=soprano, A=alto, T=tenor and B=baritone. Letters that are duplicated (as in A in this example) indicate multiple parts.
And finally, here is one more way to visualize the above code sequence:
Flute (doubles or with additional Piccolo)
Oboe (doubles or with additional English Horn)
Clarinet (doubles or with additional Bass Clarinet)
Bassoon (doubles or with additional Contrabassoon)
Saxophones (band music only, showing SATB voicing)
- (dash)
Horn (doubles or with additional Wagner Tuba)
Trumpet (doubles or with additional Cornet)
Trombone (doubles or with additional Euphonium)
Tuba (doubles or with additional Euphonium)
Percussion
Tympani
Strings (1st & 2nd Violin, Viola, Cello, Bass)
Other Required Parts
