Email Privacy Statement
Buzz Tools respects your privacy and are committed to protecting
it. Buzz Tools, Inc. provides this Privacy Statement to inform
you of our privacy policy.
We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment
to your privacy and the protection of your information.
Why did you receive a mailing from us?
Our email marketing is permission based. If you received a mailing
from us, our records indicate that (a) you have expressly shared
this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future
("opt-in"), or (b) you have registered or purchased
or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. We respect
your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our mailings.
How can you stop receiving email from us?
Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease
receiving email from us, or to change your expressed interests.
If you wish to do this, simply follow the Unsubscribe Link or
Update Profile links at the end of any email.
How we protect your privacy
We use appropriate security measures to protect against the loss,
misuse and alteration of data used by our system.
Sharing and Usage
We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information
with anyone for their promotional use without your advance permission
or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to
us is only available to employees managing this information for
purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your
request for information, and to contracted service providers for
purposes of providing services relating to our communications
with you.
Use of Web Beacons
When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow
us to determine the number of people who open our emails. When
you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual
response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web beacons
collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier,
time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the
page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).
Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do
not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable
HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your
