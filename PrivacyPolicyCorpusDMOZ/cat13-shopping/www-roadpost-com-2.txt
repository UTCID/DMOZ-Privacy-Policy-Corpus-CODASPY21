Returns Policy
Roadpost Returns Policy
If you need to return an item it’s no problem. Simply ship the unopened item back to us within 30 days. Please be aware that we can’t accept returns on orders over 30 days, or on orders that have been opened. There’s a 15% restocking fee for returned items, so your account will be credited 85% of the item price. Note that prepaid airtime and shipping costs are not eligible for refund.
Damaged Items
If you receive a damaged product, we’ll get that taken care of. You simply need to contact Customer Service to request a repair and maintenance (RMA) number before you return it. We will not accept return of damaged goods without an RMA number, so please call.
