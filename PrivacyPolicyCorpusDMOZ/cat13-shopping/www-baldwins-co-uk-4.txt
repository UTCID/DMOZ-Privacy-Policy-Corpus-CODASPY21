Where can I find more help?
(back to top)If you can't find what you're looking for here then please feel free to contact us using the details listed below:
Call us on 020 7703 5550 or, use our Contact Form Here
How do I search for something?
(back to top)The search facility is located at the top of the screen. Just look for the magnifying glass symbol, click it and enter a couple of words relating to what you are looking for into the text box that appears and either select the item that has matched your search or click 'show all results' to view everything related to your search query.
Alternatively you can use the categories at the top of all pages to browse items by related categories. If you enter a category with multiple items you can also use the filtering on the left hand side of each category page to narrow down exactly what you are looking for.
How does my shopping basket work?
(back to top)Just like a shopping basket in a supermarket, you can put things in your basket (by entering a quantity and clicking on the 'Add To Basket' button next each product) without having to buy them - it is just a way of holding on to things that you are interested in. You are not committing to a purchase until you take your selected item(s) through the checkout.
To add a product to your basket, navigate through the categories or via the search to find the product(s) you are interested in. Enter the quantity you require and click the 'Add To Basket' button. You will notice the contents of your basket are shown in the top right hand corner. You can add more products to your basket in the same way. Once you are happy with the contents of the basket click on 'Go To Checkout' to be taken to the next stage.
You can check what is in your basket at any time by clicking on the basket icon in the top navigation. If you wish to remove something, simply change the quantity to zero (0), or click the trash can symbol button next to the appropriate product, this will recalculate/update your basket.
When you are happy with the products you have in your basket, click on Go To Checkout'. You will then be taken through all the relevant steps to pay for and dispatch your goods to you.
How do I register?
(back to top)You only need to register once for to Baldinws and this will allow you to easily make future purchases without having to re-enter all your details. Registration is simple, you will be asked for various billing details and need to enter a valid email address and password. Any fields marked with a * are mandatory.
Your registration details are not passed onto a third party and you should keep your Baldwin's password in a safe place, as this provides anyone access to your personal details, as well as your previous orders.
You can register here before checking out: Register A Customer Account
What happens if my details change?
(back to top)You can change your details online, such as your telephone number, by going to the 'My Account' link at the top of each page.
If you have any problems or questions then please telephone 020 7703 5550 or, use our Contact Form Here
Can I place an order and arrange for it to be sent to another address?
(back to top)Yes! When you place your order you can indicate a different delivery address.
You can also save multiple delivery addresses in your account. Simply log in, go to addresses in the options and select 'Add Address' to input friends, family, work addresses etc..
How do I check/change my order?
(back to top)You are free to amend your order before you make any payment by going to your basket. To check the status of an order, once you have placed it, go to 'Order History' and all your previous orders will be shown. You can check the status of an order that you have placed by going to 'Your Account' and clicking on the link. You can even click on an order and re-order any items you purchased previously, directly from here.
Is it safe to give my bank account or card details online?
(back to top)Yes, absolutely. We encrypt your order and the transaction details to make sure that they are completely safe and secure.
Do you deliver overseas?
(back to top)Yes! All deliveries are subject to a delivery charge. The sub-total is calculated in your order details before you confirm the order.
Can I send goods to a BFPO address?
(back to top)Yes! For customers who wish to have goods sent BFPO (British Forces Post Office) please fill in your billing details as normal and then fill in your BFPO address in the delivery address. Enter the name and address and use the postcode field to enter the BFPO number preceeded by 'BFPO', i.e. BFPO 49 for Brussels. In the delivery country choose 'British Forces PO' from the drop down. This will then calculate your order with zero VAT and UK postage.
How do you calculate postage?
(back to top)We have a postage calculator which you can use to calculate the cost of shipping goods to your country.
What payment/debit/switch/credit cards do you accept?
(back to top)We accept the following Credit and Debit cards: American Express, Delta, JCB, MasterCard, Solo, Switch and Visa. You can also choose to pay by faxing us your credit card details or by cheque.
I'm having problems signing in and adding items to my shopping basket.
