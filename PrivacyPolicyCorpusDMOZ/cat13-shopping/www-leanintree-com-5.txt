Important information for California residents.
WARNING: The materials used as colored decorations on the exterior of this product contain lead and/or cadmium, chemicals known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. Lead and cadmium levels in these products comply with FDA standards.
Proposition 65: In November 1986, Californians approved an initiative (Proposition 65) to address exposure to toxic materials. More than 750 chemicals, some of which are naturally occurring and some synthetic, have been included in Proposition 65. Under this law, businesses are required to provide a clear and reasonable warning before knowingly or intentionally exposing anyone to a listed chemical. All companies that sell products in the State of California are required to comply with Proposition 65 labeling. Proposition 65 is NOT a mandate of the United States Government or any of its departments. Because Trumble Greetings/Leanin' Tree does not have total control over the production process and cannot control the final destination of our products, we voluntarily apply warning labels to the products that fall under Proposition 65 in the event they are purchased in California.
