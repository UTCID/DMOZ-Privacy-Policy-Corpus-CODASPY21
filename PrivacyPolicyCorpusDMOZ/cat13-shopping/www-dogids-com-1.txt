dogIDs Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. By accessing our website or any of our products or services, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy, as may be revised or amended.

Legal Information
What if I have more questions on this policy?
What do you do with my information?
When you purchase our products over the phone or online, you provide us with basic information. This information may include: billing and/or shipping address, telephone number, form of payment, email address, pet information, product and service preferences, what you purchased and where (i.e., telephone and/or website). We use that information you provide to service your account, to ship an order to you, to provide warranty service on products and/or services you purchased, and to personalize your experience with our company.
Do you share my information with anyone?
Customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company who intends to use it for marketing purposes without the consent of the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product to the customer and improving the shopping experience for all of our customers. All data is requested, but can be removed at any time. Any information provided is used to track orders and use in marketing, if you have selected to join our mailing list. This data is tracked for 36 months, and can be removed at any time per request of customer.
Are my payments processed securely?
We use encryption and other types of technology to reasonably protect and safeguard your personal information and transactions, whether you purchase via a credit card, Amazon Pay or Paypal.
If you pay for your purchase with credit card, whether it’s online or via telephone, we will never display or store your full credit card information. For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, Braintree, keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf. We utilize SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), the industry standard security protocol. All of your ordering information is encrypted using this secure server for maximum security.
When will you email me?
We do ask that all orders are placed using an email address so that dogIDs may send you a receipt for your purchase, notify you of status changes in regards to your order and notify you when your order is shipped. Those are the main emails you will recieve when you purchase a product from us.
45 days after your purchase, you will also receive an email requesting that you submit a product review via our Third Party review platform, Yotpo. It is your choice if you decide to submit a product review through this platform. They will send one additional email asking for a review if you don’t complete it after the first email. Turnto is also the service that provides question and answer options for our customers on the website. You may occasionally get an email asking for your perspective on a product for a current customer. You may choose to unsubscribe at any time from that marketing.
Will you send me regular email marketing?
If you choose to join our marketing email list, we will send out regular email newsletters to the address that you gave us with promotions, dog owner tips and new product announcements. You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails. You can join our email list here.

Depending on the web browser you use, you may be able to customize how much of your website browsing is being tracked with cookies.
What does dogIDs use cookies for?
