Silver Eagle Coins
First struck in 1986 and minted continuously ever since, the American Silver Eagle serves as the official silver bullion coin of the United States and is one of the most popular coins ever created in the history of American currency. The distinguishing characteristic of the Silver Eagle coin is its composition: it contains one troy ounce of .999 pure silver. This Silver Eagle bullion coin can also serve as a funding vehicle for Individual Retirement Accounts. Since its introduction more than 30 years ago, the American Silver Eagle dollar has been produced at three U.S. mints: Philadelphia, San Francisco, and West Point.
Silver Eagle dollars feature the unique "Walking Liberty" obverse design created by German-born sculptor A.A. Weinman for the Walking Liberty Half Dollar minted from 1916 to 1947. The reverse, designed by American sculptor and engraver John M. Mercanti, portrays a heraldic eagle behind a shield below 13 five-pointed stars depicting the original U.S. colonies. The result is a stunning masterpiece that has been immensely popular with everyone from casual collectors to serious numismatists over the years.
