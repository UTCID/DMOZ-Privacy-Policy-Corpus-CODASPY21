"I'll be asking you for some more vanilla soon, trouble is that your vanilla is so good you really don't have to use much to give cakes a beautiful flavour.The powder is fantastic in the cheese frosting for the carrot and banana cakes. It really is the best vanilla we've used so far"
Cath from Jersey
"I would just like to say thank you for the vanilla pods which I recieved in the post this morning.  The smell was heavenly!.  The vanilla was well packaged and your service is excellent.  I will be back for more at some point!  Thank you"
