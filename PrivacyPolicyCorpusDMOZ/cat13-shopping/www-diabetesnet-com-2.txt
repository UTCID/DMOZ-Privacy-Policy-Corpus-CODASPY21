Cookies
What is a cookie?
Cookies are small text files which are downloaded to and stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to provide you with a good experience while you browse, and also to provide information which can help us improve our website.
Our site uses cookies to:
make our site work
collect anonymous data on how users navigate our site, which helps us to improve it
allow you to share our content on social networks
help us provide relevant advertising to those who may be interested in it
We do not use cookies to:
collect any personally identifiable information
pass personal identifiable data to third parties
What cookies will we use and for what purposes?
We have split the cookies used on our site into four categories – strictly necessary cookies, functional cookies, performance cookies and advertising cookies. Each of these categories is explained below along with details of the specific cookies used, though within each category we may use additional or alternative cookies at any time. Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be performance cookies or advertising cookies.
A. Strictly Required Cookies These cookies are required for the website to run and cannot be switched off. Such a cookie is only set in response to actions made by you such as language, currency, login session, privacy preferences. You can set your browser to block these cookies, but our site may not work then.
B. Analytics and Statistics These cookies allow us to measure visitors’ traffic and see traffic sources by collecting information in data sets. They also help us understand which products and actions are more popular than others.
C. Marketing and Retargeting Our marketing and advertising partners usually set these cookies. They may be used by them to build a profile of your interest and later show you relevant ads. If you do not allow these cookies, you will not experience targeted ads for your interests.
D. Third-party cookies We use some third-party services or software on our website. If you go to a page on our website that contains this embedded content you may be sent cookies from these websites, for example, YouTube videos, Google maps, Facebook and Twitter. We do not control the setting of these cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party website for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.
Controlling the use of cookies
Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies unless you change your browser settings. If you wish to restrict, block or delete the cookies which are set by any websites, you can generally do this through your browser settings. These settings are usually found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your internet browser. Please note however that if you set your internet browser preferences to block all cookies, you may not be able to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your internet browser settings to block cookies, our site will set cookies.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
Third Party Analytics Services
Diabetes Services uses third party analytics services. See here for how Google uses data when you use our Service and how you may opt-out (www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).
This is what we don’t do with your data:
We are not sharing your personal data with any third parties
We are not processing your data via non-SSL connections
We are not reselling your data
We are not monetizing your data
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
Following termination or deactivation of your account, we may retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, contract performance and enforcement, or audit purposes but for no longer than is necessary and only where the information is accurate and relevant for our use. Furthermore, we may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your User account.
