COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.

Fair Information Practices The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices CrochetKim.com will notify you by email within one business day should a breach occur.

Many of you have written to me to ask how you can help support CrochetKim. A Patreon account was suggested but I thought it would be better to provide ad-free PDF's of my patterns. You can, of course, view, print ,paste to a word processor, convert to PDF's, etc, on your own. This is just an extra feature so that people help out if they want. Thank you to all of you for your overwhelming support and kindness these many years. Enjoy! View my ad-free patterns here.
