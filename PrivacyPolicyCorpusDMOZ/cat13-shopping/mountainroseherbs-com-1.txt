SOURCING
Since 1987, quality has meant 3 very important things to us:
Certified organic or pesticide-free plant products that are sustainably harvested.
Vibrant, tasty, potent, and consistent herbal goods that exceed customer expectations.
A product that is proven safe through laboratory analysis.
From the moment our herbs are harvested to the time they arrive on our docks, we monitor and log each step to fulfill our promise of quality to our customers. From pre-ship sample screenings, to comprehensive laboratory analysis, we complete a thorough program before selling our beautiful botanical products to you.
We hope you enjoy the quality of our herbal products. We will continue to work diligently to be your reliable supplier of organic botanicals.
Sourcing Our Botanicals
Here at Mountain Rose Herbs, the first criteria for purchasing botanicals are the potential social and environmental impacts of growing, harvesting, and drying herbs. This applies to all botanical goods harvested and produced overseas, as well as right here in the United States.
We have a strict policy that guarantees workers a fair market value for the goods they produce. We have discontinued items and refused to carry particular products because laborers were not given an equal voice, a fair wage, or because we felt sensitive bioregions were being compromised.
Our first choice when sourcing herbs is always certified organic. If organic isn’t available, we will choose an ethically wildharvested or "cultivated without chemicals" option. If wild gathered material is harvested, each gatherer must fill out a "wild take audit" to ensure that our precious plant populations have only undergone a sustainable 10% take.
Quality in the Field
Mountain Rose Herbs currently has more than 14 organic farm operations producing some of our most popular botanicals. Since 1987, we have built solid foundations with farmers and suppliers who consistently provide quality herbs and spices that meet our high standards.
Quality from the Farm to You
Before any herbal products are allowed into our facilities, we request a "pre-ship" sample for analysis. This sample is analyzed using organoleptic (sensory) and laboratory methods, and if approved, it is authorized for order.
When the herb we ordered arrives at our facility, it is immediately quarantined for QC review. At this point, a qualified Quality Control member will extract samples for immediate testing in our laboratory.
