2. CHANGES IN ORDERS. Purchaser reserves the right at any time to make changes in any one or more of the following: (a) specifications, drawings and data incorporated in the Agreement, where the items to be furnished are to be specially produced for the Purchaser, (b) methods of shipment or packing, (c) place of delivery, and (d) time of delivery.

Price increases or extensions of time for delivery will not be binding on Purchaser unless evidenced by a purchase order change notice issued and signed by Purchaser.
3. DELIVERY AND DELAY. The seller will deliver the goods in the quantities and will deliver the goods and/or provide the services, within the time (which is of the essence), in accordance with the specifications, drawings or approved samples, and at the prices in the Agreement. Failure of the seller to comply with such requirements will entitle Purchaser, in addition to any other legal rights or remedies, to cancel any order and be relieved of all liability for any undelivered portion. In the event that, for reasons which are unforeseeable and beyond Purchaser’s reasonable control, shipment is delayed beyond the last date on which shipment by the method contemplated herein would result in delivery guaranteed on or before the required delivery date herein, the seller will make shipment by the most expeditious available method of transportation, and any additional cost of such shipment will be borne by the seller.

The seller will be liable to Purchaser for any loss or damage resulting from the seller’s failure to act so as to provide adequate protection during shipment.
