The designer type fragrances available here are not the Designer originals, they are our own replications in concentrated form, completely free of alcohol and other harmful fillers.
Our designer types accurately replicate the scent, but are not the original product.
All of our fragrances are created in-house, or expressly for us by a select group of boutique perfumers.
