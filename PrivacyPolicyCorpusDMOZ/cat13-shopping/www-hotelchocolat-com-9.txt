We like to get to know our customers and provide them with the best possible experience. We may use your information to form a view on the products or services we think you would like, or that may be of interest to you.
You will receive marketing messages from us if we have your marketing consent or if you have requested information from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that
marketing. We may also market to you if we have received your express consent to do so including
where we have collected your details in connection with a competition or other promotion and you have agreed to receive marketing from us. More details about the types of marketing
communications we might send you are included in Section 3 above.
You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. Once you do this, we will update profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages.

Or, you can log in to your account and update your preferences in the My Account Section of our website.
The action of unsubscribing from email will also opt you out of any social media custom audience targeting which requires a match via your email address. However, you may still see our promoted social network posts where you fall into audiences we’re targeting from social media’s proprietary data or if you follow Hotel Chocolate or wider estate accounts (including international and other brands) social media accounts. You can chose to manage who you follow and what data your social network uses of yours in each platform
•	The action of unsubscribing from email will also opt you out of any search network custom audience targeting which requires a match via your email address. However you may still also see Hotel Chocolat in organic or paid for listings if searching a relevant keyword or phrase.
If you have opted in on our website to receive offers in the post from companies who we think may be of interest to you, but have now changed your mind, please login to the My Account Section of our website and change your preferences.
Alternatively, just emai help@hotelchocolat.com with "UNSUBSCRIBE REQUEST" in the subject line and the email address that you wish to be removed within the email. We will action any unsubscribe request from you as promptly as possible.
7) Hotel Chocolat adverts online

to keep you aware of what we’re
up to
and
to
help

We target Hotel Chocolat
banners and ads to you when you are on other websites and aps. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and a variety of advertising technologies like pixels, ad tags, cookies and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook Custom Audience Service.
The banners and ads you see will be based on information we hold about you, from what you’ve bought in the past or browsed on our website.
We would always encourage you to become familiar with the privacy policy of the other websites as our Policy applies solely to the personal information collected by us through our service and does not apply to these third party websites.

put
in
place
appropriate

measures

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
