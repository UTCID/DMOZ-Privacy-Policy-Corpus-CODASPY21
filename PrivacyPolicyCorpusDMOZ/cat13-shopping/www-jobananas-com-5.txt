DESPATCH TIMES
At JoBananas customer satisfaction is very important to us and we want your shopping experience with us to be a great one!
We carry good levels of stock at our warehouse and we aim to despatch orders on either the same or next business day wherever possible. Obviously from time to time a size or colour option may be temporarily out of stock but we get deliveries from our suppliers several times a week so we are not usually out of stock for long.
If you are in a hurry for your order, please do contact us to check stock levels before placing your order. You can phone, email or get us on the online chat feature on our website.
If your order despatch is likely to be delayed by more than 3 business days we will email and let you know when your order is likely to be shipped.
We send emails upon despatch of your order so we keep you informed every step of the way.
If there are any issues (for example if we need to check your address), we will contact you by email or telephone to let you know what is happening, so please make sure that your contact details are correct.
You can log into your account at any time and check on the status of your order by clicking on “Orders history” in the view cart box on the right hand side:
Not finished – we have not received payment for your order and this order will not be shipped
Processed – we have received your order and payment (confirmed by email)
Failed Payment – your payment was not sucessful
Queued – we are currently working on your order
Backordered – we are waiting for a delivery to fulfil your order if this is likely to be longer than a few days we will contact you by email
Shipped – your order has been shipped by your chosen shipping method (confirmed by email)
If you have any queries regarding the status of your order you can always contact us by email or telephone (Mon-Fri 9:00am - 5:00pm).
SHIPPING METHODS
Costs can be found on the Shipping page.
Please note that the following timescales are given for guidance only and we will not be held responsible for any delays.
UK Orders
Royal Mail orders usually arrive 1-2 days after they are sent.  If you select "Signed for" (recommended) a signature will be required upon delivery. *
"Special Delivery" (recommended for orders over £34) insures the delivery whilst in transit and orders should arrive the day after despatch before 1pm (Mon-Thur), they will require a signature upon delivery. *
* If there is no one to sign for the delivery the postman will leave a card and the order will be taken back to your local sorting office. The card will explain what your options are for redelivery or collection. The sorting office usually holds items for a week and then they return them to us, if this happens we will get in touch with you to discuss arranging redelivery costs.
Worldwide Orders Orders sent by airmail usually arrive within 10 working days of being posted but may take longer depending on the postal service and delays in Customs.
Please note that items sent by this method are not insured, so we recommend that the chosen shipping method for orders over £30 is Signed for Airmail.
We only hold proof of posting receipts for 3 months - non delivery of orders must be reported within this time scale.

LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
At JoBananas, body jewellery is handled as little as possible but is not sterilized prior to despatch - we recommend that customers sterilize all jewellery before insertion and by placing an order with us you are agreeing to this. We give general guidance on this site about the materials used in our jewellery and suitability for different piercings but this is our opinion only and must not be relied upon. Customers should seek the advice of a reputable piercing studio with any concerns regarding piercings or in the case of an emergency seek medical advice.
JoBananas does not take any responsibility for any harm or injury caused by using our products and will not be held responsible for the replacement of jewellery damaged by misuse, improper care, or for jewellery ordered in the wrong size, style or material for your piercing. All jewellery is despatched in clear sealed packets allowing the items to be fully inspected prior to opening, by opening the sealed packet you are confirming that the jewellery has arrived in perfect condition.
JoBananas Ltd shall not be held liable regarding any legal action resulting in discrepancies made from the purchase or complications following the use of our products.
SECURITY:
Credit Card Security
This website is owned and operated by JoBananas Limited and all website transactions take place on secure servers including our use of the advanced UK based payment processor, Sage Pay. Sage Pay process millions of secure payments each month for over 30,000 businesses. Every transaction is encrypted to the highest global standards and once on Sage Pay's systems, all sensitive data is secured beyond the levels demanded by the payments authorities and card schemes. Sage Pay has multiple private links into the banking network which are regularly monitored and all data is safeguarded by Sage Pay's twin data centres and state of the art disaster recovery.
We care about your security and have ensured that this website secures your private information using the world renowned and verified GlobalSign SSL Certificate brand. All information exchanged with any address beginning with https is encrypted using SSL before transmission.
Here at JoBananas we do not get to see (or store) any of your credit card details. All we receive back from our payment processor is an "Authorised" or "Declined" message. All security check and contact with banks required for authorisation is processed on our behalf by Sage Pay on their own secure systems.
PayPal Payments
JoBananas Limited also offer PayPal as an alternative way to pay for your purchases, and all Paypal payments are handled through their secure website. PayPal protects your credit card information with industry-leading security and fraud prevention systems. When you use PayPal, your financial information is not shared with JoBananas and the only people who see your credit card details are yourself and PayPal. PayPal is one of the largest processors of online payments and handles most of the transactions for the eBay auction site.
Our SSL Security Certificate
You can click on the “padlock” icon whenever you are on a secured page e.g. the Checkout pages when you are buying goods. There, you will see that our secure certificate covers any encryption on the main website (www.jobananas.com). You are also covered on the majority of mobile devices should you buy our products via your smartphone or iPad, for example.
Protecting You Against Fraud
We take online fraud very seriously, and as such we are set up to participate in the latest protection schemes. If your card is enrolled in the MasterCard SecureCode protection scheme (MasterCard and Maestro cards) or the Verified by Visa (Visa, Visa Debit, Delta, Visa Electron cards) then we offer you the option of securing your payment with your card provider and bank, by entering your chosen password. If you are not enrolled in these schemes, then you can choose to complete your order in the normal manner (see note below), or we can connect you to your bank so that you can enroll in the scheme.
PCI DSS Compliant
The PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards), a set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security, was developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council, including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa Inc. International, to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis. The PCI DSS is a security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures. This comprehensive standard is intended to help organisations proactively protect customer account data – YOUR data.
At JoBananas, we ensure that we have fulfilled the requirements as set out by the PCI Security Standards Council which means that jobananas.com is PCI DSS compliant. Equally, Realex's systems (which process your card payment details) are audited annually to ensure they maintain their level 1 – the highest level – compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They are also checked monthly and scanned quarterly by one of the world’s leading independent Qualified Security Assessors.
