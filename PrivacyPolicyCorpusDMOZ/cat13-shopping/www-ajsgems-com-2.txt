Our Return Policy
Customer satisfaction is our top priority. If you are not completely satisfied we are pleased to offer a ten (10) day return policy on all gemstone purchases. If within 10 days of receiving your gemstone you become dissatisfied with it, return it in its original undamaged, unaltered condition for a refund or a credit. No questions asked and no hidden restocking fees.
In the past, we have always issued full refunds upon a return, with no charge for credit card fees, since we were able to recover those fees from the credit card processors. Unfortunately recent policy changes by the banks have made it impossible for us to continue that policy, since the credit card processors will no longer return fees to us.
We will now subtract 4% from refunds to cover credit card fees. However, as a gesture of goodwill for our valued customers, we will give you store credit for the 4% fee, credit you can apply to your next gemstone purchase.
Please note that custom jewelry is non refundable.
Please Send us an Email asking for Return Instructions. The shipping & insurance fees are not refundable. All returned merchandise must be sent by registered mail (no FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc..) Appropriate return packaging and registered mail fees are the responsibility of the customer returning the merchandise. We will insure all returned items at our own expense. After 14 days all sales are final (returned items must be postmarked within 14 days of the date you received the items).
If you decided that you do not want the merchandise after it has been shipped but before it arrives, Please Do Not Refuse UPS or Postal Delivery. All Items must be returned to us only by registered mail we must insure these items using the registered mail receipt number. If the merchandise is refused you will be liable for the full value of the item or items if lost and all brokerage charges and duty incurred upon its return.
Additional Information for Non-USA shipments: In many countries (not USA) properly declared shipments are subject to custom charges and tax. Registered Mail takes longer but usually avoids additional fees. We are happy to send via UPS but please keep in mind that we have no control over extra charges occurring in your country. The buyer is responsible for any customs, tax and duties in their country. Returns because of such charges cannot be accepted.
