We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the products or offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals, or the accuracy of the content of their website. Gaiam does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of any such website.

Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
Privacy Policy: Gaiam respects your privacy and permits you to control certain aspects of the treatment of your personal information as set forth in our Privacy Policy. A complete statement of our current Privacy Policy can be found in the “Privacy Policy” section of the Website. This policy governs your visit to the Website and explains how we treat your personal information, and how we protect your privacy when you use our Service. The Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.
Shipping and Return Policies: Please review our shipping and return policies at https://www.gaiam.com/pages/shipping-information and https://www.gaiam.com/pages/returns. These policies govern the purchases you make on our Website, so that you may understand our sales practices and procedures.
Notice And Procedure For Copyright Infringement Claim: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "Act") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Accordingly, Gaiam reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your right to use the Website if Gaiam determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are involved in any activity that may be infringing, including alleged acts of infringement, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing. Gaiam accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their materials. In addition, pursuant to the Act, Gaiam has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed infringements and for processing such claims in accordance with the Act. If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our designated copyright agent with the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringed or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Gaiam to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit Gaiam to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted; (e) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on such copyright owner’s behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the Act shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. Gaiam’s designated copyright agent to receive notification of claimed infringement can be reached by writing to: Sequential Brands Group, Inc. c/o Legal Department 601 W. 26th Street, 9th Floor New York, New York 10001 or by emailing legal@sbg-ny.com.
Member Disputes: You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Members. Gaiam reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Members.
Termination: You may terminate your membership at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Profile page. You agree that Gaiam, in our sole discretion, may terminate your account or your access to our Website or the Service immediately, with or without notice to you, and without liability to you, for any reason, including, without limitation, if Gaiam believes that you have breached any of the terms of this Agreement or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Agreement, furnished Gaiam with false or misleading information, or interfered with use of the Website or the Service by others.
Disclaimer of Warranties. You expressly understand and agree that:
YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. GAIAM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, THE WEBSITE, AND ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITE WITH WHICH THEY ARE LINKED.
GAIAM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (II) THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF ANY HARMFUL COMPONENTS (INCLUDING VIRUSES); (III) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; (IV) THE QUALITY OF ANY CONTENT, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS; (V) ANY ERRORS IN THE SITE OR INFORMATION OR MATERIALS THEREIN WILL BE CORRECTED, AND (VI) THE SITE AND ITS CONTENTS AND SERVER THAT MAKES THE SITE AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF ANY VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MISDELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA.
ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM GAIAM OR THROUGH OR FROM THE WEBSITE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
Limitation on Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, IN NO EVENT WILL GAIAM, ITS AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICE, THE WEBSITE OR ANY WEBSITE WITH WHICH THEY ARE LINKED, EVEN IF GAIAM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Gaiam's liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to Gaiam for the Service. Otherwise, if you are dissatisfied with any portion of the Website, or with this Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Website. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Gaiam will not be liable for: (a) the contents of any communication, message, or information posted by you or other third parties; (b) the content of any website not controlled, owned, or operated by Gaiam that is accessed from or linked to this Website; (c) the content, services or information provided by any website purporting to be operated by Gaiam or its affiliates, but not actually affiliated with, controlled, owned, or operated by Gaiam; and (d) any damages or injury caused by, including but not limited to, any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation of transmission, computer virus, or line failure.
You further specifically acknowledge that Gaiam is not liable, and you agree not to seek to hold Gaiam liable, for the conduct of third parties, including other users of the Services and operators of external websites and that the risk of use of the Services and external websites and of injury from the foregoing, rests entirely with you.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS, DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.
24. Exclusions and Limitations: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, in certain jurisdictions, some of the above limitations of liability may not apply to you; all other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.
Indemnity: You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Gaiam, its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and third-party providers from any and all third party claims, losses, liability, damages, and/or costs (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising from any violation of the terms of this Agreement; your infringement, or infringement by any other user of your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity; your use of the Website; or your connection to the Website. Gaiam will notify you promptly of any such claim, loss, liability, or demand, and will provide you with reasonable assistance, at your expense, in defending any such claim, loss, liability, damage, or cost.
Additional Terms: We may also require you to follow additional rules, guidelines or other conditions (“Additional Terms”) in order to participate in certain promotions or activities available through our Website, to obtain certain premium Content through our Website, or for other reasons. In addition, certain Additional Terms will govern any purchases you make through the online stores located on our Website. These Additional Terms will be posted on the relevant portions of our Website or on the portions of our Website that describe the specific promotions, Content, or activities. These Additional Terms are part of this Agreement, and you agree to comply with them when you participate in those promotions, purchase items from our online stores, or otherwise engage in activities governed by such Additional Terms.
Modification and Discontinuation: We reserve the right at any time to modify, edit, delete, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently the Service or our Website (or any portion thereof) with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, editing, deletion, suspension or discontinuance of the Service or our Website.
Entire Agreement: This Agreement, together with any other terms or policies referenced herein (including without limitation the Privacy Policy and Additional Terms), constitutes the entire agreement between you and Gaiam and governs your use of the Website and Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Gaiam with respect to the Website and Service.
Choice of Law and Forum: This Agreement and the relationship between you and Gaiam shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Gaiam agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Denver, Colorado.
Waiver and Severability of Terms: The failure of Gaiam to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.
Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions: You and Gaiam waive all rights to a jury trial, instead electing that any disputes be resolved by a judge. You also agree that any disputes with us shall be resolved on an individual basis, and that you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class consolidated or representative action.
Statute of Limitations: You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Website, the Service or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
Headings: The section headings and sub-headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
