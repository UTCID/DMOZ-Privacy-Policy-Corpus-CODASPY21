Dispatch times may vary according to availability and subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for
which we will not be responsible.
In order to contract with Netrition, Inc. you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a
bank acceptable to us. Netrition, Inc. retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is accepted we will
inform you by email. When placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are
an authorized user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost
of the goods. The cost of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes.
(a) Our Contract
When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming receipt of your order.
This email will only be
an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us will not be formed until we send you
confirmation by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation
e-mail sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.
(b) Pricing and Availability

the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund.
Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in the
'Total Cost'.
(c) Payment
Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard authorization check on your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds to
fulfil the transaction. Your card will be debited upon authorization being received. The monies received upon the debiting of your
card shall be treated as a deposit against the value of the goods you wish to purchase. Once the goods have been dispatched and
you have been sent a confirmation email the monies paid as a deposit shall be used as consideration for the value of goods you
have purchased as listed in the confirmation email.
