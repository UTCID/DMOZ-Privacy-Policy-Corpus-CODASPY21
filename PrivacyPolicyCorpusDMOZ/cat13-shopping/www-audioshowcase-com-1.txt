Here at CableWholesale.com, we know it can at times feel forbidding to input
personal information with your order. Customers are sometimes hesitant to
enter e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or credit card information. We have
therefore adopted the following Privacy Policy, so that our customers may be
assured that their personal information never leaves our company, and is used
only for practical purposes in the order process. Listed below are our
policies.
We collect only the information that is necessary to keep the customer well
apprised of their order status.
We use the provided information to send order and shipping confirmations,
and to notify customers of delays or special situations. While we may store
a customer's e-mail address to pass along an occasional technical
newsletter or a coupon for special savings, we do not telemarket or send
unsolicited e-mail at any time.
Your information never leaves CableWholesale.com. We do not sell or release
any customer information to third parties. There are no exceptions to this.
Information collected over our website is fully secure. All information is
collected over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the Internet standard for safe
data transmission. Once on our servers, data is stored in an encrypted
database.
If you have any questions regarding these policies, or would like to discuss
them further with our Customer Service team, please feel free to
contact us via phone, fax, or e-mail. Please
check back from time to time to view any changes or additions to our Privacy
Policy.
