Payment for orders from private customers and all non-UK residents is required prior to despatch and can be made by a credit/ debit card registered to your billing address or by bank transfer. UK residents can also pay by cheque and non-UK residents by bank transfer (or credit card in some cases).
VAT Charges
All prices shown in this catalogue and on our website are exclusive of VAT (sales tax).
VAT (sales tax) is currently charged at 20% and will be applied to every order unless: you are a business elsewhere in the European Union and can provide us with your Sales Tax Number (the equivalent of the UK VAT Registration number); reside outside the European Union or you are subject to VAT relief – see below for further details.
VAT Exemption - for people with a disability
Certain products that we sell can be purchased at a price exempt from VAT.
This is known as VAT exemption and is subject to the following rule: The product has been specifically designed for use by people with a disability and is being purchased by, or on behalf of, someone who is disabled.
When placing an order online or via the telephone for products which qualify for VAT exemption you can request VAT exemption. For us to complete your order and take payment with VAT exemption applied you are requested to complete a ‘VAT Exemption’ form. View our ‘A Guide to VAT Exemption’ section on our website, where you will also find more details on this subject. You can complete and submit the form online via our website, making it quick and easy to do. If the product doesn’t qualify for VAT exemption then you will be charged VAT at 20% as normal. Our carriage charge is always subject to VAT even if all the products in your order are not.
