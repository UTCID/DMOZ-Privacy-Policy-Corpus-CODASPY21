PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITYNo real-time audio transmitted,
guaranteeing
privacyGET STARTED
Bank-grade encryptionNo real-time audio transmitted, guaranteeing your privacy.
All detection and machine learning analysis is conducted at the detector head, with no real-time audio data sent across the network. This is crucial to maintain privacy.
The bandwidth used by each detector is minimal -
9 kb/s. As a result, the network is physically incapable of sending real-time audio, which mitigates a significant privacy concern.
The system operates on an IEEE 802.11 certified wireless protocol, boosted by our own proprietary network layer. Our stack is designed with security as its primary focus, and all communications are transmitted with AES 256-bit bank grade encryption.
Key security advantages Detection on the edgeSimilar to fire alarm systems, only activation and heartbeat messages are transmitted to our servers No real-time audio transmittedAll analysis is conducted at the detector head, eradicating privacy concerns
World-class serversUtilising a network of world-class distributed US based servers maximises reliability and security
Bank-grade encryptionMesh network communications are transmitted over a AES 256-bit encrypted connection
