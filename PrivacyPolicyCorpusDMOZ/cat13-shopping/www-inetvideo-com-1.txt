Our cookies enable us to provide features such as welcoming the visitor by his name, saving his/her  Wish List, storing items in his/her Shopping Cart between visits, and setting up other preferences the visitor establishes during each visit to the website.
iNetVideo also uses cookies to help determine whether the visitor came to the website from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can be used to help save and retrieve usernames used on the website and provide information on past purchases.

Every computer on the Internet is identified by a unique number called an IP address. If the visitor has a static IP address, he/she gets the same number each time she connects to the Internet. If the visitor has a dynamic IP address, a number is assigned from a pool of addresses maintained by his/her ISP (Internet Service Provider) on a first-come basis. iNetVideo only uses the visitor’s IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, to administer its Site, and to gather basic demographic information.
