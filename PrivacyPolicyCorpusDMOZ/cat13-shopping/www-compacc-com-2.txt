Terms & Conditions of Sale
PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU.
*BATTERIES ARE SHIPPED DRY DUE TO SHIPPING REGULATIONS (no acid)*
These terms and conditions apply to the purchase and sale of products and services through CompetitionAccessories.com (referred to as the “site”). By placing an order for such products and services, you agree to be bound by and accept these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you should not obtain products or services from this site. These terms and conditions are subject to change by Competition Accessories (referred to as “us” or “we”) without prior written notice at any time, in our sole discretion. The latest version of the terms and conditions will be posted on this site, and you should review these terms and conditions prior to purchasing any product and services that are available through this site. These terms and conditions are an integral part of the Site Terms of Use that apply generally to the use of our site. You should also carefully review our Privacy Policy before placing an order for goods or services through this site.
1. Order Acceptance and Cancellation
We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept, decline, or limit your order for any reason, whether or not your credit card has been charged. If your credit card has been charged and your order is canceled you will receive a prompt refund credit to your account. We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item.
Once an order has been placed, it cannot be canceled unless the shipment is unavoidably delayed. In such a case, if you request that we cancel your order, we will use our best efforts to cancel the order with the manufacturer. Some item(s) are marked as Special Order parts from a given manufacturer. Any such item(s) is NON-CANCELABLE regardless of the situation as we cannot cancel these items from the manufacturer. If we are able to cancel your order and your credit card has been charged, we will promptly credit the charge(s) back to your account.
We are a reseller to end user customers and do not accept orders from dealers, exporters, wholesalers, or other customers who intend to resell the products and services which are offered on our site.
We make every effort to maintain the availability of our site. However, should we experience technical difficulties, we are not responsible for orders that are not processed or accepted.
All orders are subject to review for suspicious activity.  In some cases, these orders are stopped during a verification process.  We want to ensure that the person placing the order is the person receiving the merchandise.  If your order happens to be flagged for fraud then we will contact you via email.  We apologize for this inconvenience, but we feel it is necessary to take these extra steps to protect our customers from fraud.
2. Payment Terms and Sales Taxes
Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, payment must be received by us prior to our acceptance of an order.
We accept Discover, MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and PayPal for all purchases. You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iii) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any.
All payments must be in United States dollars. Current billing address and phone information must be included with every order. You agree to pay interest on all past-due sums at the highest rate allowed by law. We retain a security interest in the products and all proceeds thereof until the full purchase price therefore (including taxes and additional charges) has been paid.
Charges for shipping and handling will be made in accordance with our then-current shipping policies, as described below.
3. Changes in Products and Pricing
We are constantly updating and revising our offerings of products and services, and we may discontinue products and services at any time without notice. To the extent that we provide information on availability of products or services, you should not rely on such information, and we will not be liable for any lack of availability of products or services that you may order through our site.
All pricing for the products and services available on our site is subject to change. For all of our prices and products, we reserve the right to make adjustments due to changing market conditions, product discontinuation, manufacturer price changes, errors in advertisements and other extenuating circumstances.
*Certain manufacturers have a consignment fee on certain items such as short blocks, crank shafts, and cylinders.  Consignment fees (core charge) pricing varies depending on the item purchased.  We are not aware of this fee at time of purchase, and are made aware before shipment to the customer.  Once you have shipped the item back to us then we will send it to the manufacturer.  We cannot refund any money for this until the manufacture refunds us, as there is an inspection process that must occur before we are reinbursed.  If the item is unrepairable by the manufacturer then you, the customer, will not be refunded.  Also, this core must be received within 10 days of arrival.  We only have 30 days to return it to the manufacturer.
4. Shipping Policy
Please note the posted shipping time frame is listed on the individual product page and may vary from item to item. The posted shipping time frame is contingent upon credit card approval and may be delayed should we experience difficulties in obtaining authorization. The posted shipping time frame may also be delayed based upon availability from the manufacturer. Unless noted on the product page or cart page, most items ship from our warehouse within 3-5 business days.
We offer a variety of shipping options to meet your shipping needs. We use only premium carriers, such as UPS and USPS, with various delivery options available for many items. You will have the option to choose standard shipping delivery at checkout, but we determine which carrier will deliver your products.  All shipping prices are quoted in United States dollars. No C.O.D. orders can be accepted.
Orders shipping outside of the United States may incur additional fees from the recipient country such as duty fees and brokerage.  These fees are not collected by CompetitionAccessories.com at the time of purchase and would be a seperate transaction that the customer is responsible for.
We require a signature for delivery of all orders of $500, unless there are multiple packages, and then the limit is anything above $250.00. For your convenience, a signature is not required for orders of $500 or less, unless there are multiple packages. If no signature is required for an order, you agree to bear the risk of loss for such orders. In other words, if we can confirm delivery of the order to the address provided, we will not refund any lost or stolen orders.
There may be occasional delays beyond the posted order processing time. If the delay is more than 10 business days, we will send you an e-mail message notifying you of the delay. If the delay will be less than 10 business days, we will ship the product as soon as it is received. If your product is on backorder for more than 30 business days, we will send you an e-mail message asking if you want to cancel the order. If you do not advise us that you would like to cancel the order, we will keep the order active.
These shipping terms are accepted by you by placing an order with us.
Special promotions that offer FREE SHIPPING apply to shipments in the 48 continental United States and are limited to Standard Shipping only. Free Shipping offers do not include oversize items or tires unless specifically noted otherwise.  At our discretion, a shipping credit of $30 may be given in lieu of free shipping.  If an order is determined to be oversize at the time of shipping, you will be contacted for payment of the additional freight charges prior to your order being shipped.  Orders that qualify for Free Shipping may be shipped to Canada*, Hawaii and Alaska for an additional charge.  Free shipping codes cannot be combined with any other offer.
*BRP products cannot be shipped outside of the United States.
If an order is determined to be oversized at any time while your order is being processed, you will be contacted for payment of the additional freight charges prior to your order being shipped.
