Terms and conditions
Cross stitch kitsOnce received, please check that nothing is missing from your kit. Please let us know within 14 days if there is something wrong with your kit.
Returns We accept returns within 2 weeks (no questions asked) on all kits and will issue a refund on receipt of returned item. Return postage fees are paid by the customer if the reason for return is other than a faulty return. If item is faulty or damaged in any way we will cover the cost of return postage.We will also replace any item that has been damaged by the post office however we need the damaged article to be returned to us so that we can forward it to the post office. We will also reimburse reasonable postage costs for sending damaged items back to us.
ThreadsWe give extra thread than the allowance recommended. We will provide more threads should you run out. However if you use the "parking method" we will not provide extra threads because we believe that this method uses large, unnecessary and wasteful amounts of threads. Also bear in mind that we will not give extra thread if you have carried over from 10 stitches. We will not provide more thread if the aida count has been changed by you. We will provide thread for the amount listed only, using two strands over one stitch.
