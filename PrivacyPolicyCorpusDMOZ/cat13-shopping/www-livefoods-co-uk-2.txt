FROZEN FOOD
We do not gaurantee frozen foods will always arrive frozen
Our rodents are packed in Modified Atmosphere Packaging, (MAP), this is a technology that has been developed to ensure that packaged food products stay fresh and attractive for as long as possible.
We have used this technology to package our freshly frozen rodents to enable us to send small quantities of rodents in the knowledge that should there be insufficient quantities to stay frozen, or if there is a small delay in delivery then the product should still be fresh on arrival.
We insulate all packages of frozen food to help prevent defrosting and if you have ordered enough volume then of course the package will remain frozen.
Frozen Food orders sent to the Highlands and Islands outside Mainland UK
Due to the remote locations and diffficulty it arranging reliable courier services we can not gaurantee fresh arrival to these areas and all orders of frozen food to these areas are at the customers own risk.
