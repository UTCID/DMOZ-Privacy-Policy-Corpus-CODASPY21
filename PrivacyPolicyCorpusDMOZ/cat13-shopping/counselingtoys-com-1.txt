About Us
Welcome to our Store!
I founded Counselingtoys.com in 2007 after discovering a need for a true Non-directive Play Therapy and Sandtray supply store.
Children need specific toys to act out themes during Play Therapy.
This often requires hard to find “old fashioned” toys that engage the child.
One day it dawned on me how much time I'd spent gathering my collection of Play Therapy toys and Sandtray miniatures.
I knew busy therapists didn't have time to search for these items, and so Counselingtoys.com was born.
Counselingtoys.com set the precedent for most Play Therapy Kits and Sandtray Kits in existence today.
We are now the global leader for Non-Directive Play Therapy and Sandtray supplies.
Our kits are designed by credentialed professionals for credentialed professionals.
Each and every toy and miniature has a unique purpose.
Unlike others, we're not randomly boxing toys or copying others' work.
We believe our integrity and devotion to our customers is unprecedented.
Please drop us a line or two if you have any questions about our products, Sandtray or Play Therapy.
We'd love to hear from you.
