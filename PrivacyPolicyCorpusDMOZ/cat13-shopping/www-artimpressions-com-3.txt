Since we create the stamps in Salem, Oregon, we have a 5-7 business day processing time before shipment, though we often ship sooner. We do our best to ship as soon as possible, but please be aware 5-7 business days is normal for our rubber stamp manufacturing process.
We require payment before your order is processed. Payment can be remitted by Credit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discovery), PayPal, or check/money order. Our system does not accept gift cards issued by credit card companies (such as a Visa Gift Card).
All orders are sent via the United States Postal Service. Domestic orders ship First Class Package (typical delivery in 3-7 business days), and packages exceeding 1 lb ship USPS Priority (typical delivery in 2-3 business days).
International orders ship USPS First Class International (delivery time varies by country, typically around 10 business days), and packages exceeding maximum weight may be shipped USPS Priority International (typical delivery in 5-10 business days). Since we must give accurate information to customs, the value paid will be declared on international orders. The receiver is responsible for any duties or fees your local customs office may impose. Since every country is different, please contact your local customs or post office for information on duties or fees.
Art Impressions is not responsible for lost or damaged packages once it leaves our facility. Please contact the United States Postal Service with your tracking number, as they have the best information to help you with your package.
We strive to make high quality rubber stamps. If you are not 100% satisfied with our products, you may return it for any reason. Our return policy is easy. You may exchange or return a product if it is in new condition and in the original packaging. You are responsible for postage to ship the item to us. Store credit will be issued unless a refund is requested and the transaction was made within 30 days. You may exchange for a product of your choice using the store credit.
If there is a discrepancy with your order, please notify us within 30 days of purchase so we can make it right. If a product is damaged, defective, incorrect or missing, you may be asked for photographic evidence via email.
As of June 3, 2019, we will only accept returns of products that are purchased directly from Art Impressions. If you would like to make a return, you must include your Art Impressions receipt from artimpressions.com or our booth. We can offer a refund as requested if the transaction was within 30 days of the receipt of your return. Otherwise, we will issue store credit for a future order for our website. If you would like to make a product return to the Art Impressions booth at a stamp show we are attending, you must bring your receipt to show our staff. If you want to return an Art Impressions product that you have purchased elsewhere, please contact the store at which you purchased it about their returns policy.
