If returning, you will be asked for your password and email address. If a new customer, you will be invited to create an account as this is your first time, before you quickly continue with your order.

You can add delivery instructions and select a time / date. There is further information on specific delivery information within our Delivery FAQ’s section further down this page.
C-Choose your gifting options.
This is step 3 of checkout and is a new option within our site and allows you to ‘accessorise’ your selection with a gift card and gift bag of your choice. You can add a ‘don’t open until’ message and also send your gift anonymously. There is further information on specific delivery information within our Gifting FAQ’s section further down this page.

This is step 4 of checkout and is where you will be able to review all aspects of your order prior to entering any payment details. This will also confirm any item quantities, messages, vouchers, discounts and offers you have within your basket, whilst breaking down your delivery and gifting costs as well as VAT. You will then be asked to review our terms and conditions prior to completing your order and paying for your items.
E-Make payment.

Registering
Why will the website not let me register?
It is possible you already have an account registered with us using that email address and password. If so please attempt to log in as an existing customer on the log in screen.
Why am I unable to log in?
This would most likely be due to you not having an active registered account, an incorrect password or a non-registered email address. Please ensure you have registered and if you are a returning customer do not attempt to register again with the same details as this will fail.
What do I do if I've forgotten my password?
On the login screen there is a link beneath the returning customer section with ‘forgotten password?’ written. Click on My Account in the top right corner and then enter your email address. You will be sent an email explaining how you access a password.
What do I do if I've forgotten my email address?
Your e-mail address must be in this format: username@domain.com (or .net, .org, etc.). If you have more than one e-mail address, be sure that you're using the correct e-mail address and password combination for the account you're trying to access. Also, if your computer is set to auto-complete the e-mail, make sure it's the correct e-mail address listed
Why does your website keep asking me to log in?
This may be because you have not been active on the site for a period of time, so we have checked you out for your security and privacy. We ask you to sign into your account any time we need to verify your identity. This includes times when you access account or order information to review or change something. If you're using a device that's shared with people you might not know or trust, like a public terminal, you should always sign out before you leave it.
How do I change the details of my online account?
Once logged in you will be taken to the "my account" section of the site. From here you will be in a position to view your order history, review products, update your details, manage your reminders, view your saved cards, track orders and manage your delivery addresses.
Shopping Bag
How do I put items in the Shopping Bag?
If you want to order an item, click the 'Add to Bag' button on the item's product detail page or by hovering above the item you are browsing within a category.
How can I change the quantity of an item I have in the Shopping Bag?
Once you've added an item to your Shopping Bag you can keep searching or browsing until your bag contains all the items you want to order. You can access the contents of your Shopping Bag at any time by clicking the Shopping Bag button at the top of every page of our website. You can change quantity by amending this within the shopping bag or initially when selecting the product itself on the product page. The quantity can be amended during checkout also.
How can I remove something from my Shopping Bag?
You can remove items from your bag by going to the shopping bag mini menu in the top right of your screen and clicking remove beneath each product.
How do I mark something in my Shopping Bag as a gift?
Many of the orders we take from our customers are designed to be sent as gifts. So simply add the items you wish to purchase to your bag and proceed through checkout as normal. You will then be able to split and group your items during checkout as well as assigning different delivery addresses and gifting options.
How do I save something in my Shopping Bag for later?
We have the perfect tool for this job! Our brand new ‘wish list’. As you browse our site you are also presented with the option of adding items to your wish list rather than your bag when viewing product pages or hovering over products within categories. We clear bags down, but your wish list is your personal list of favourites ‘saved for later’ any time.
My Shopping Bag looks right. How do I finish my order?

Klarna
Pleas note, Klarna payment method is only available for single deliveries
Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments
Who is Klarna?
Klarna is a Swedish payment service provider that takes end-to-end responsibility for your payment. Klarna is the provider of smooth payments to more than
200,000 online stores. Over 85 million consumers worldwide have trusted Klarna to securely handle their payments.
How does Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments work?
Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments will allow you to spread the cost of your purchase over 3 equal payments. The payment for each instalment will
automatically be collected from the debit or credit card you entered at checkout. Your first instalment will be collected when your order is confirmed by
Hotel Chocolat and instalments 2 and 3 are scheduled 30 and 60 days later, respectively. You can always monitor your payments’ schedule in the Klarna app.
Am I eligible for Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments?
To use Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments you must be at least 18. Whilst this option is widely promoted, Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments is subject to
your financial circumstances. When choosing Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments, our assessment will not affect your credit rating.
How can I increase my chances of being accepted for Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments?
Klarna is unique and offers Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments based on a number of factors such as the order value, previous order history and item
availability. If you are 18 or over, you can improve your chances of being offered Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments by ensuring you provide your full name and
accurate address details and shipping to your registered billing address. All orders are assessed individually. Just because you have been accepted for a Klarna
payment method before does not mean it will be offered for every order and in turn, as it is denied does not mean it will be denied for all future orders.
What do I need to provide when I make a purchase?
If you want to make a purchase with Klarna using Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments, you'll need to provide your mobile phone number, email address, current
billing address and a debit or card card. The mobile number is required in case we need to reach you. All communications will be sent to your email address. It's
very important that you give us the correct details, as otherwise you will not receive your payment schedule and any updated order information.
Will a credit search take place against me?
Klarna may run so-called unrecorded enquiries (or soft credit searches) that do not affect credit scoring and are only visible to you and Klarna, but not visible to
other lenders. Neither Klarna nor Hotel Chocolat run credit searches against you that could impact your credit rating.
Why have I not been offered Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments?
Although Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments is widely promoted it is not always universally available. The Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments payment option
is automatically generated by algorithms that are dependent upon a number of factors including address details, cardholder details, amount of order, the online
store, previous order history and item availability.
What are my payment options with Klarna?
Payment for your Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments will automatically be collected from the debit or credit card you entered at checkout. The first payment is
taken when the order is confirmed. The second and third instalments are collected 30 and 60 days, respectively, after the first instalment. You can always monitor
your payments’ schedule in the Klarna app.
What happens if I cancel or return my order?
As soon as Hotel Chocolat have accepted your cancellation/return, Klarna will cancel any future scheduled payments as well as refund any amounts due. The return
will be reflected in the Klarna app immediately.
What happens if I don’t pay for my order?
Klarna will automatically attempt to collect your payment for your Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments purchase at Hotel Chocolat from the debit or credit card
you entered at checkout. If we are unable to collect your payment on the scheduled due date Klarna will make one further attempt to automatically collect
payment two days later. Should this last payment attempt fail, Klarna will issue you a statement for the full outstanding order amount which will become payable 15
days later. Klarna shall notify you when a payment is due two days in advance of attempting to collect your payment and you can always monitor the due date in
Klarna app at your convenience. Your credit score will not be impacted by using Klarna’s ‘Pay later in 3 instalments’ product even if you have failed to pay on time.
I have been asked to go to the Klarna site. Is this correct?
You can view all of your Klarna purchases and payment schedule in the Klarna app or by logging onto Klarna.com/uk.
Is my payment information safe?
Payment information is processed securely by Klarna. No card details are transferred to or held by Hotel Chocolat. All transactions take place via connections
Can I pay before the due date?
Yes. Just go to the Klarna app or log onto Klarna.com/uk and pay off early.
Have you received my payment?
Klarna will notify you via email and push notification from the Klarna app when a payment is due and when this has successfully been collected, or in the unlikely
event of your payment failing. If a payment has been collected but you have not received payment confirmation, you can always check the status of your order and
payments in the Klarna app or by logging in at www.klarna.com/uk.
What happens to my statement, when I've returned the goods?
Once Hotel Chocolat has received the return (partial or full) and you have received their confirmation of this, an updated statement with an adjusted payment
schedule will be sent to you by Klarna if you've made a partial return. With a full return, we shall refund any payments collected and cancel any future scheduled
payments. You are always able to monitor the status of your order in the Klarna app.
I've received a statement, but I've not yet received my goods.
In the event that your goods have not been received please call Hotel Chocolat to check on your order and delivery status. You can also contact Klarna’s Customer
Service so that we can postpone the due date on your payment or put the order on hold in the Klarna app while you wait for the goods to arrive.
I have cancelled my order. How long will it take until I receive my refund?
As soon as the store has registered your cancellation or your return, the refund will be processed within 5-7 business days.
I have asked for a refund. How will I be refunded?
Refunds shall be issued back to the debit or credit card which was originally entered at checkout.
I haven’t received an email with my statement/payment information.
You can log in the Klarna app or at www.klarna.com/uk, where you will find all of your orders and payment schedule information.
I still have questions regarding payment, how can I get in touch?
Visit Klarna app or Klarna’s Customer Service page for a full list of FAQ’s, live chat and telephone options.

the Klarna app or email reminders to pay – and, if very late, we’ll also send you a text or letter, too. Your credit score will not be impacted by using Klarna’s ‘Pay

I have been asked to go to the Klarna site. Is this correct?

If you want to make a purchase with Klarna you need to provide your name, address and email address. For some orders you may need to provide your mobile
number or date of birth, too. All information will be sent to your email address, including payment reminders and links to your online statements. It's very important

Products
What is the "Tree To Bar Experience"
Unique only to the Rabot Estate, and drawing on our expertise as a chocolatier as well as a grower, the Tree to Bar is an exclusive opportunity for guests to create their own chocolate! The Tree to Bar experience starts with guests walking on the estate cocoa groves selecting ripe cacao pods cut from the tree, and ends with making their own chocolate bars and truffles from beans that guests have roasted themselves. The tour includes all the stages in between: seedling nursery, fermenting room, sun-drying station, grinding, mixing and lots of tasting!
Where can I find out specific dietary information on products?
Dietary information is available on the product page to the right hand side of the product. If you require further information, we would ask that you send us an email at help@hotelchocolat.com
What is your chocolate ethics policy?
Here at Hotel Chocolat, we are very passionate about the Ethical side of our business. Our chocolate ethics policy can be found online via the following link - Engaged Ethics.
I can't find a product on your website, have you stopped producing it?
We do strive to constantly improve and refresh our product range and try out new ideas, and therefore our range does change quite often.
Are there age restrictions on certain products?
Yes – when signing up to Hotel Chocolat, we ask you to confirm whether you are over 18 years of age as some of our products are age restricted, such as alcohol.
How do I review a product?
You can write a review on each product by selecting the product you wish to review. At the bottom of the product page, you will have the option to enter your details into the ‘Tell us what you think’ form
Do you grow all your own cocoa?
No, and this will never be our aim. However, we are proud to be one of the only chocolate brands to actually grow cocoa, on our own 140-acre estate in Saint Lucia. Together with the cocoa from 180 independent growers who are part of our sustainable cocoa programme in Saint Lucia, this accounts for c5% of the cocoa we use across our whole business. Being a grower has given us real 'at the coal face' knowledge about the issues facing all cocoa growers and made us a better partner for them. We have directly experienced the difficulties facing cocoa growers and, as a result, better understand the main issues of 1. how to make a sustainable level of profit 2. the agricultural quality challenges around gene type and fermentation/drying techniques. If we were to grow all our own cocoa, we could run the risk of creating a monopolist, neo-colonial-style cocoa power. Rather, we wholeheartedly celebrate and support cocoa farmers and cocoa farming communities around the world and strive to spread the sustainable blueprint we have created in Saint Lucia further around the world over the coming years. The technical expertise we have built up over nearly a decade as a cocoa grower means that we know what top-quality cocoa is really like, and the risks to cocoa quality, often locked into the cocoa before it has left the growing area. As chocolatiers we have also found that cocoa from different parts of the world has a dazzling array of flavours – the red fruit intensity of Vietnamese versus the roast nut notes of Ecuador. We love working with a wide spread of the planet's best cocoa and our customers love the huge spectrum of flavour notes.
Can I buy my favourite chocolate individually from the box it came in?
Yes. This is best served by taking a look through our Selectors range within the shop our collection area of our site.
Do the beauty products have a Best Before Date?
Each product features a PAO (Period After Opening) symbol. The symbol identifies the timescale of optimum efficacy of the product after first opening, it is used with a written number of months (i.e. 12M) It does not mean that the product will not be safe beyond that point. All of our products undergo rigorous and extensive testing to ensure their efficacy, safety and quality. In the EU, cosmetics products with a shelf-life of at least 30 months are not required to carry a “best before end…” date. Instead, there has to be "an indication of the period of time after opening for which the product can be used without any harm to the consumer".
Animal Testing:
We do not test our products on animals, nor do we commission testing of ingredients on our behalf.
Recycling:
Our goal at Hotel Chocolat is to provide consumers with safe, effective products and use recyclable materials whenever possible. What happens then depends on the local facilities available for recovery or recycling of packaging waste
Are the beauty products suitable for the face?
These products are very much designed with body care in mind. As such the levels of fragrance; levels of warming and particle size of exfoliation, are not developed with the delicate facial skin care in mind.
Parabens:
Parabens are a group of preservatives widely used in toiletries and beauty products. Recognising the specific demands that our consumers are making on their cosmetic products and their core beliefs, we have created this range without the use of parabens
What is different about the Rare & Vintage Collection
Just as with a fine wine, the terroir, fermentation techniques and the plant type itself are the major influencers of flavour. An estimated 80% of the flavour potential of the chocolate is locked into the bean by the time it leaves the plantation. That’s why we evaluate every single harvest before deciding which recipe to go for to really do justice to it – we test roasting time and temperature, conching time and temperature, cocoa percentage – we include this information on the batch label so that we can continually make changes to reflect what nature gives us each time.
Where is the chocolate made
All of the beans within our Rare & Vintage range have been sourced by us and the recipes are all developed by our team of Chocolatiers, ensuring we get the very best out of the specific beans. On the packaging of the 70g bars we have even stated who the Chocolatier is.
Are the grades suitable for diabetics
We support modern medical advice, which discredits the concept of ‘diabetic chocolate’. Enjoyed responsibly, chocolate can be enjoyed as part of everyone’s healthy balanced diet. Of course, it helps that the 100% grades in our Rare & Vintage range do not contain any added sugar and the high cocoa milks contain as little as 16% added sugar.
Is the range suitable for vegans
We believe our dark chocolate is suitable for vegans, however as it is made in the same environment as our milk chocolate we cannot guarantee it is free from milk traces.
What does conching time mean
Conching is all about developing the flavour of your chocolate. The more you conch the more mellow and smooth the flavours will become, the shorter you conch the more punchy and powerful the flavours will be. During our Rabot development it was all about experimenting to get a conch time which released the best flavours.
What is the Rabot Estate
Our own much-loved cocoa plantation, The Rabot Estate, was first established back in 1745 in Soufriere, Saint Lucia. The old estate house still stands proud, a survivor of wars, hurricanes and the ravages of sea and sun, down near the equator. The rich and fertile volcanic soil, high altitude (c.1000ft above sea level) and rainforest water all create a unique environment (terroir), perfectly suited to cocoa production, in which our cocoa trees flourish.
What is the Rare & Vintage Collection
We have made Rare & Vintage into our quality emblem, to be bestowed carefully upon all that meets our standards and becomes a part of our rare and vintage cocoa collection. It stands for all the enduring values we have learned to hold onto since we first became cocoa farmers ourselves.
What does Engaged Ethics mean
Engaged Ethics is our phrase for a ‘roll up the sleeves and get stuck in’ form of enlightened capitalism, leading and changing by example, by direct involvement and risk taking. Starting from scratch on our own estate in Saint Lucia we now have more than 150 other cocoa farmers who have joined our scheme. Being paid the right amount, being treated with respect and paid on time, giving a long term commitment to build a future on and by sharing ‘know how’ to improve quality and yield – all this was needed to bring cocoa farming back to being a viable and sustainable enterprise on this small island. We are looking for similar values when we buy beans from estates in other parts of the world and to share our knowledge to make cocoa growing an ethical and fulfilling enterprise. You can find out more here.
What are Natural Farming Methods
This is a term we use for the cocoa grown on our Rabot Estate. The Rabot Estate is not organically certified but farmed using organic principles. We do not use any pesticides at all. This is fully traceable as we manage the Estate ourselves and stringently oversee all processes. We also use this term for other grades that are made using organic cocoa beans but the other ingredients used are not organic.
What future plans are there for the Rabot Estate
The next stage of development for The Rabot Estate is to build a chocolate factory and start making chocolate using local ingredients and local labour. Making chocolate in Saint Lucia and exporting it to the UK is a reversal of the normal practice, which is to add all the value in Europe, giving only the value of the commodity to the cocoa growing economy. We will be training local people in chocolate making, using ingredients and creating a whole value chain around this new enterprise. We’ve already chosen our site and HRH Prince Charles kindly broke the ground during his latest visit to the island.
What is single côte chocolate
We're proud to be the world’s first chocolatier and cocoa grower to present a single côte chocolate, The Rabot Estate Marcial 70% dark. . Not just single origin (from one country), or even single estate, we've gone deeper into the world of cocoa and produced single côte chocolate using beans from a single terroir section of the plantation
Where are the cocoa beans in your single côte chocolate from
This single côte chocolate hails from our own plantation in Soufriere, Saint Lucia, where the cocoa has been kept separate as it is picked and fermented from each côte (terroir section) within the estate. This particular côte, Marcial, is a beautiful part of the estate near the Rabot lake, with a mix of grizzled 80-100 year-old trees and fresh new four-year-old trees planted as seedlings, all bearing the rare Trinitarios bean unique to the Rabot Estate.
Where can I find more information
More details about our single côte chocolate and the Rabot Estate can be found here.
How do you determine the cocoa percentage on the products that display a percentage
First of all we evaluate the cocoa bean, to get a better understanding of its character. We then trial a batch at least three times until we arrive to a % of cocoa which brings the best out of the bean. Hotel Chocolat is all about more cocoa less sugar, so during our Rare & Vintage development we aimed for our milk chocolate to be above 50% and our dark chocolate to be above 70%. This allows the true character of the bean to shine through

What sort of clothing should I take?
