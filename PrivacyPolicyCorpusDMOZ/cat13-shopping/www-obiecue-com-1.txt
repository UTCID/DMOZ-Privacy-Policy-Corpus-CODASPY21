About Us
Welcome to our Store!
Founded in 1985, Obie-Cue's started as a spice store, selling high-grade bulk spices direct to the public, cheap. We opened in DFW's nicest flea market with only a few shop-made blended seasonings.
Obie Obermark created all the Obie-Cue's seasonings. His wife Patricia Obermark guided us from part-time to a real business and her organizing skills keep both Obie and Obie-Cue's from falling apart.
Tina keeps our retail operation running smoothly. Read More ....

Shipping Policy
We ship either UPS or Priority Mail, as you specify. UPS offers better tracking; mail is generally cheaper on lightweight orders and many rural deliveries. We do not add \"handling charges\" on standard shipping, but the carrier's shipping expenses are added to your bill. We pull orders on Mondays, and ship on the first available pick-up. Orders received after 9 AM on Monday will ship the following week.
Satisfaction Guarantee & Returns Policy
We like happy customers. If you have a problem with your shipment or spices, use the Contact Us form or e-mail obie@obiecue.com. We're not happy unless you're happy, and we like being happy. Read More ....
