Items eligible for payment plan are indicated by clicking on the Payment Plan link found on each item page.HOW IT WORKS    Payment plans are available on orders starting at $900.    A deposit of $300 or 10%, which ever is greater, of the total price is required upon purchase.    The balance must be paid in installments of at least $300 or 10% per months, whichever is greater.    Select your monthly payment term from the dropdown menu at checkout.    Title remains the property of Medusa Ancient Art, Inc. until payment is made in full.    Your order will ship once payment is made in full.
NOTE: Some items do not qualify for payment plans. All payment plan orders must be paid within 10 months from the order date. Exceeding this tiem frame will result in forfeiture. To get your order faster, you can pay-off your order in full or increase your monthly payments at any time.REFUNDS & EXCHANGES on PAYMENT PLANSYou may cancel your payment plan purchase within three (3) months, a 15% restocking-fee will apply.
