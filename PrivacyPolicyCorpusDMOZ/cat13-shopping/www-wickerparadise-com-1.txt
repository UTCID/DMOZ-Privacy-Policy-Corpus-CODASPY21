Refund PolicyWicker Paradise takes pride in the quality of all the furniture we sell. If you are not satisfied with any item, call us at 1-800-8-WICKER and we will rectify the problem to your satisfaction. If and only after we have tried to rectify the problem and does not meet your satisfaction, we will refund your money in full less shipping charges to your home (we offer free shipping, however on returns this would be calculated by the shipping costs from our carriers). You are responsible for shipping charges to return the item(s). We will not allow any refunds/returns after you have an item for 5 days or more.There are no refunds for any reason on orders with cushions or umbrellas; they are made specially for you and cannot be returned. Shipping InformationFurniture is delivered to your home, but not inside your home. In-home delivery service is available per your request (call us for in-home delivery fees).
It is your responsibility to either keep the boxes the furniture or cushions arrived in or to provide the boxes if you wish to return an item(s).Replacement Cushions Policy:Please note: all replacement cushion sales are final.
We take pride in all of the cushions that we sell. Cushions are custom made for you and are non returnable/refundable. Therefore, please double-check all measurements listed and measure your furniture frames (not your cushions). Please also note the cushion shape; for example, square or rounded corners.Changes to your order cannot be made and orders cannot be canceled after the fabric has been cut and put into production. Rest assured if there is a defect in your cushion, it will be replaced at no cost to you.Please be aware that cushion orders placed during the height of our season (May-July) may need additional time and can take up to 5-6 weeks to ship.Cancellations Before Your Order ShipsNew York State law permits cancellation of an order within 48 hours of the placement without any penalty . If you wish to cancel after 48 hours, the order is subject to a 30% re-stocking fee.
DamagesWe use the utmost care in shipping your furniture, but occasionally items do get damaged. We will replace the damaged item at no cost to you. While receiving your shipment, if a box is badly dented, ask the delivery person to wait while you examine the contents of the box. If the item is damaged beyond minor touch-up, refuse the item (but KEEP ANY CUSHIONS) and we will replace the piece at no cost to you. When in doubt, call us at 1-800-8-WICKER and we will advise you on what to do with any problems you might have. We have earned a top-service rating with Yahoo and we are committed to your satisfaction. When you sign for the furniture be aware that you are signing received in good condition except as noted. We cannot look for the trucker to make good for an item a day or two later. You must call within 24 hours of receipt of any delivery to report any damage. Your failure to do so negates any claim you might have.
Fabrics & Furniture Color DisclaimerWe have made an effort to provide fabric and furniture images that closely represent the furniture and fabric colors. However, due to all the possible variants (e.g. light source, monitor quality, etc.), we cannot guarantee that the images accurately represent the true colors. Please take this into consideration if you are trying to match colors of materials. We do offer the service of sending fabric sample to give you confidence in your fabric selections and see them in true light in person.Warranty Information Wicker Paradise warranties our outdoor furniture frames for 2 years from the date of purchase and all indoor wicker furniture frames for 3 years from the date of purchase. Any indication of abnormal use, abuse, or use in unintended areas will void this warranty. Warranty does not cover cushions or fabrics. Wicker Paradise will repair or replace at our discretion any covered item during the warranty period. Customer is responsible for freight to and from the factory. Warranty is not valid in a commercial application.
Please note the consumer is responsible for freight to return the item and the freight to receive the item under any warranty claims. Please note that only Sunbrella fabrics are warrantied for fading.
