The price charged for a product or service will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes. Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email.
We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors.
Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, payment must be received in advance, before any product is produced or shipped.

SHIPMENTS; DELIVERY; TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS
We will arrange for shipment of the products to you. Please check the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges.
Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the products to the carrier/delivery. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments.
RETURNS AND REFUNDS
We will accept any standard non-custom product for a refund of the purchase price of the product (less shipping and handling costs) within 30 days of the delivery date to the customer, exceptions are noted below, and provided the product is returned in its original condition.
You will be responsible for all shipping and handling charges on returned items.
You bear the risk of loss during shipment.
There is a 25% restocking/cancellation fee for cancelled, changed, or returned orders once the order is in production.
WE OFFER NO REFUNDS ON ANY CUSTOM PRODUCTS.
We do not refund custom or modified products, accessories or parts used or unused for any reason.
This includes, custom sized cages, any portion of a cage that has custom options installed such as (but not limited to) drilled holes for shelves, wire inserts, panel substitutions, or any other option deviating from the original basic cage configuration.
If panels are substituted, the total value of the substituted panel will be subtracted from customer refund amount, not just the amount of the upgrade.
All options installed by us are completed using our best judgement with your preferred positioning in mind.
If you claim the items were not placed in accordance with your best wishes, it is our discretion whether it is an error that requires replacing or if it was done within our sound judgment.
Any mistake in installation in no way extends our return policy to cover any other provisions such as refunding shipping and handling, or any other provisions that are otherwise not covered.
Once an enclosure is used by an animal, it is not refundable for any reason even before the 30 day return policy expires.
Once an order is placed and is in production and is cancelled, it is our discretion to refund shipping and handling as well as custom options.
Customer is responsible for all packaging, labor, shipping, and custom option costs incurred prior to cancellation in addition to the restocking fee.
The dollar amount of these costs is at our discretion.
You must submit a return authorization form to return any product for refund or exchange.
Return authorization forms can be found on the our website, or we can mail or email you the form upon request.
We must have a signed copy (scanned documents are accepted via email) before we will issue a return authorization number.
We will not accept any package without a return authorization number.
Returned items must have the return authorization number clearly written on the outside of every returned package.
Packages without a return authorization number clearly labeled will be refused and returned to sender at sender’s expense.
We do not refund shipping and handling charges under any circumstances.
We are not responsible for arranging
or paying for shipping returns.
In no way does late delivery, defective or damaged parts, or any other circumstance make us responsible for refunding shipping and handling charges or paying for shipping returned items.
If any of our various packages are ordered and individual items are returned, the customer will be credited the purchase price of the properly returned items minus the purchase price of the non-returned items.
You will forfeit any package discount when returning a partial order.
If the items are shipped via freight, you must have items delivered to a location with a loading dock, or be at the delivery location at the time of shipment and unload the truck by hand.
Lift gate and unloading service, extra handling, trade show deliveries, and remote delivery charges are extra charges.
If any extra charges (accessorial charges) are not paid for at the time of purchase and the shipping company retroactively charges us for these charges, you authorize us to charge your credit card or invoice you for the additional charges.
Liftgate and unloading service includes curbside delivery and does not include moving the products inside the your house or location in any circumstance.
DAMAGE -- MISSING PARTS
You must inspect the products upon delivery and immediately notify us (within 48 hours of receipt) in writing of any damage to any product that occurred prior to your receipt of the product (due to shipping or otherwise) or any missing parts.
Your notice may be via email to info@cdecages.com or through the post office.
Your notice must include: your name, order number, and date of receipt and claim, as well as a digital photo of the damaged item or an inventory of missing parts.
It will be at our discretion to determine if the damage was done prior to delivery to warrant a replacement or repair or if there were parts missing that need to be sent or refunded.
It is also our discretion to determine if you must return the damaged item before it is replaced or refunded.
The postage date on surface mail will be considered date submitted for damage claims.
If there is damage done prior to delivery and we determines a replacement is warranted, we will send replacement parts via UPS standard ground service.
Faster service will be an additional charge.
A damaged or missing part in no way extends our return policy to cover refunding shipping and handling costs or the cost of shipping products back for refund or exchange.
DEFECTS AND DAMAGED RETURNS
Defective and/or damaged products must be returned to us at your expense before any refund will be given.
Once returns are received, we will inspect for damage or defect.
If we determine that the damage or defect occurred before it left our facility, we will determine if they warrant a refund or a replacement and the amount of the refund or replacement.
Acceptance of a return from an outside carrier (ie. FedEx or UPS) does not mean we agree the products are in acceptable condition for a refund or replacement.
Returns may take up to 2 weeks to complete inspection and processing.
Once returns are opened and inspected, any part in unacceptable condition, or determined to have been damaged by you, will be deducted from the return amount.
Unacceptable or missing cage or accessory items will be deducted from the refund amount at the full retail price.
We will determine, in our sole discretion, if the parts are in acceptable condition or missing and the rate at which individual parts are deducted.
Parts and panel sections will be all or nothing basis, no partial refund will be given for damaged panel assemblies.
We will not refund products damaged caused by you including but not limited to damage incurred while shipping the product back to us, products damaged during assembly and/or disassembly, or products damaged by an animal.
