DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AARON’S SERVICES MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES OR ERRORS. CHANGES ARE PERIODICALLY MADE TO THE
AARON’S SERVICES AND WE MAY MAKE CHANGES TO THE AARON’S SERVICES AT ANY TIME. ADVICE RECEIVED VIA THE AARON’S
SERVICES SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR PERSONAL, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT AN
APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL FOR SPECIFIC ADVICE TAILORED TO YOUR SITUATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE INHERENT
RISKS TO PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ACCOUNT NUMBERS OVER THE INTERNET. ALWAYS USE CAUTION WHEN GIVING
OUT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF. YOU AGREE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE AARON’S SERVICES
ARE SUFFICIENTLY SECURE TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO
YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM ANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED FROM OR
OTHERWISE PROVIDED THROUGH THE AARON’S SERVICES. THE AARON’S SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, SOFTWARE,
APPLICATIONS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND RELATED GRAPHICS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY
KIND. NEITHER WE NOR OUR SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SUITABILITY, RELIABILITY,
AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND
RELATED GRAPHICS CONTAINED IN THE AARON’S SERVICES FOR ANY PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, AARON’S, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES, FRANCHISEES, AND ITS AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, LEGAL, STATUTORY, CONTRACTUAL, EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL, DELICTUAL OR IN TORT, AND WHETHER ARISING BY LAW,
STATUTE, USAGE OF TRADE, CUSTOM, COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR THE PARTIES' CONDUCT OR COMMUNICATION WITH
ONE ANOTHER, OR AS A RESULT OF THE NATURE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONFORMITY WITH USAGE, EQUITY OR LAW, OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, WORKMANSHIP,
CONFORMITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR GENERAL PURPOSE, TITLE, OWNERSHIP, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSORS, FRANCHISEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENCIES, AND SUPPLIERS, BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, (I) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, DATA, PROFITS, REVENUE, OR GOODWILL, (II) THE COSTS
OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, (III) PERSONAL INJURY, (IV) PROPERTY DAMAGE, (V) BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, OR (VI) COMPUTER, MOBILE DEVICE, OR ELECTRONIC DEVICE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE AARON’S SERVICES, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE
AARON’S SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE AARON’S SERVICES, OR FOR ANY
INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, APPLICATIONS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS OBTAINED THROUGH THE AARON’S
SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE AARON’S SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES
WERE FORESEEABLE, AND EVEN IF WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSORS,
REPRESENTATIVES, FRANCHISEES, AGENCIES, OR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE
SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES/JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH LOCAL LAW. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE AARON’S
SERVICES, OR WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE
AARON’S SERVICES.
INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Aaron’s harmless (including our parents,
subsidiaries, franchisees, and affiliates, and all of our and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, licensors, and suppliers) against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to your use of the Aaron’s Services or breach of these Terms of
Service. At our expense and election, we reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
matter subject to indemnification by you and you agree to cooperate with us in connection with our defense. Your
indemnification obligation shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service.
DISPUTES/ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER
1. DISPUTES SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION/ CLASS ACTION WAIVER
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE AARON’S SERVICES
(“Disputes”) SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY IN BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN LITIGATION IN COURT. This
Agreement to arbitrate applies to all Disputes, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or any other legal or
equitable theory. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Agreement, you or Aaron’s may bring Disputes in an
appropriate small claims court so long as the relief requested falls within the jurisdiction of the small claims
court, but neither you nor Aaron’s may bring claims in any other court. You and we agree that any questions
about the scope or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement will be decided by a court, not the arbitrator.
You agree that we may file a lawsuit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
rights.
YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN
INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN
A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO BRING A CLASS OR
REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN ARBITRATION OR TO SEEK RELIEF ON BEHALF OF A CLASS IN ARBITRATION. YOU ALSO
EXPRESSLY
WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION IN COURT OR TO PARTICIPATE OR OBTAIN BENEFITS IN A CLASS ACTION
SOMEONE
ELSE BRINGS IN COURT. You and we acknowledge that this class action waiver is integral to the
Arbitration
Agreement. If a court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver is invalid or unenforceable, you and
we both agree that this Arbitration Agreement will not apply, and any Dispute shall be resolved in court. That
is, you and we agree that this class action waiver cannot be severed from this Arbitration Agreement. It is the
express intention of both parties not to proceed with any Dispute by way of class arbitration. We also both
agree that you or we may bring suit to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Arbitration is a process to resolve disputes before a neutral person (an arbitrator) instead of having a trial
in court with a judge and/or jury. THEREFORE, BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE WAIVING
YOUR
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY. YOU ARE ALSO WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING CLAIMS IN COURT AND TO BRING OR
PARTICIPATE
IN A CLASS ACTION. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court except that, in the
case of
injunctive or declaratory relief, an arbitrator cannot issue an injunction or declaratory judgment that extends
beyond you and Aaron’s and affects Aaron’s obligations or liability to other parties. An arbitrator can,
however, issue an injunction or declaratory judgment on your claims so long as it is limited to providing you
with individual relief. Arbitration is more informal than litigation and generally provides a quicker and more
cost-effective way to resolve Disputes, but there is only limited discovery in arbitration, and there is only
very limited review of an arbitrator’s decision.
2. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES AND RULES
You and Aaron’s agree that this Arbitration Agreement is subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. Arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Consumer Related Disputes Supplemental Procedures. Those rules
are available at www.adr.org. or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A single arbitrator will decide our
Disputes. To initiate an arbitration, you must file a demand for arbitration with the AAA, following the AAA’s
rules and procedures as set forth at www.adr.org. Arbitration shall be held in the state in which you reside at
the time you initiate the arbitration. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
3. COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IN ARBITRATION
If you file an arbitration claim against Aaron’s hereunder, Aaron’s agrees to pay the AAA initial filing fee on
your behalf for claims totaling less than $1,000, unless the arbitrator determines that the claims are
frivolous. Except for such initial filing fee, you and we agree that we will each be responsible for our own
costs and attorneys’ fees in arbitration. The arbitrator’s fees will be divided between us as set forth in the
AAA’s Consumer Related Disputes Supplemental Procedures. If you are the prevailing party in the arbitration,
Aaron’s agrees to pay you for any arbitrator fees you paid in the arbitration or to pay the arbitrator for any
fees owed by you. If you prevail in the arbitration and are entitled to recover your attorneys’ fees or costs
under an applicable statute or common law doctrine, then the arbitrator has the authority to award you such fees
and costs but is not required to do so. Aaron’s agrees that it will not seek to recover its attorneys’ fees and
costs from you even if it prevails in the arbitration and is entitled to recover those fees and costs under an
applicable statute or common law doctrine, unless the arbitrator determines that the claims are frivolous.
GENERAL
Use of the Aaron’s Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect
to all provisions of
these Terms of Service. By using the Aaron’s Services, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable
federal law, and the laws of the State of Georgia, U.S.A. without regard to its conflict of law provisions, will
govern these Terms of Service and any dispute that might arise between you and Aaron’s. Except with respect to
Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained
above, you and Aaron’s hereby consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Atlanta,
Georgia to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement. YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY
WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
AARON’S SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD,
SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED. You agree that you are not entering into a joint venture,
partnership, employment, or agency relationship with us as a result of these Terms of Service or use of the
Aaron’s Services. Our performance of these Terms of Service is subject to existing laws and legal process, and
nothing contained in these Terms of Service are in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court
and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Aaron’s Services or information
provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. No failure or delay on our part to exercise or enforce
any right or provision under these Terms of Service will operate as a waiver of such provision or any rights,
nor will any single or partial exercise of any right preclude any other or further exercise of any other right.
If any part of these Terms of Service is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law
including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deleted and the remainder of the Terms of Service shall be in full
force and effect. The Section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or
contractual effect. These Terms of Service operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. These Terms of

obligations under this Agreement. It is the express wish of the parties that this agreement and all related
documents be drawn up in English. Les signataires confirment leur volonté que la présente convention, de même

CUSTOMER TRANSACTION - CONFLICTS
You expressly agree that these Terms of Service for use of the Aaron’s Services are
independent and separate
from the contract for a purchase or lease transaction that you enter into with us, including the Aaron’s
Arbitration Agreement entered into in connection with a purchase or lease transaction. Any lease transaction
with us is governed by your Lease Purchase Agreement, Rent to Own Agreement, Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement,
Lease Agreement with an Option to Purchase, Lease Agreement, or Rental Purchase Agreement (as denominated under
state law) and is the only contract between you and us with respect to the merchandise and services set forth in
that contract. Nothing in these Terms of Service should be interpreted to change or modify any terms of that
contract, or the Aaron’s Arbitration Agreement entered into in connection with a purchase or lease contract, or
to create a separate contract between you and us regarding the purchase or lease transaction. In the event of
any conflict between these Terms of Service and the contract covering your purchase or lease transaction or the
Aaron’s Arbitration Agreement entered into in connection with a purchase or lease contract, the contract
covering your purchase or lease transaction and such Aaron’s Arbitration Agreement, will apply and prevail.
