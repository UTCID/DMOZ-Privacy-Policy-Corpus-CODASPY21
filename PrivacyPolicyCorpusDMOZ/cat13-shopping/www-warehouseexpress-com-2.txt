Payment methods
Wex Photo Video is all about convenience, flexibility and peace of mind and accordingly we are able to accept a variety of payment methods. You may place an order either online or by phone.
We accept all major Credit and Debit cards.  (American Express payments are only accepted in our call centre or in any of our stores and are not currently available online.)
We also offer payment by bank transfer and, subject to application, financial circumstances and borrowing, consumer credit finance with 3 finance options available. If you wish to apply for finance, please select the finance option available during the checkout.
For business users we also offer leasing finance options for items from £1000 (excluding VAT).
Security and online shopping
For greater peace of mind for our customers when ordering online and to speed up the progress of orders Wex Photo Video has adopted the Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode fraud prevention schemes (often referred to as "3D-Secure").
We encourage our customers to sign up to these schemes which entail registering your card with Visa or Mastercard. For more information on these schemes and how to enrol your card (if you have not already) then please click on the relevant link below:
Sign up at Visa.co.uk
Sign up at MasterCard.com
Do you accept payments from cards which are not enrolled in the Verified by Visa or MasterCard Secure Code schemes?
We will continue to accept cards which are not registered under the schemes although for fraud prevention purposes there may be a delay in processing your order as we perform additional checks and occasionally we may request further information from you prior to releasing any goods.Additionally we will NOT ship to a delivery address that differs from the registered card address unless they are paid for using a Verified by Visa or MasterCard Secure Code enrolled card OR we are able to verify that you are a customer with a history of ordering from us to your registered card address that dates back at least 3 months.
What credit and debit cards do you accept?
We accept all major credit and debit cards, including:
Visa
Visa Electron
MasterCard
Delta
American Express (accepted in all our stores and via our contact centre)
Can I pay using PayPal?
Yes, PayPal is available as a payment option on orders up to £5000.  This can be selected during the checkout process, however next day delivery is only available for PayPal accounts with confirmed shipping addresses. There may be delays in shipping to customers with PayPal accounts who have not yet confirmed their address as these may be subject to additional security checks. Find out how to confirm your address
Using PayPal Express
Why use PayPal Express?
PayPal Express allows you to place an order on our site without the need of creating a password or having to input all your details. PayPal Express Checkout provides you quick access to your secure shipping and billing information by using your existing PayPal account information.
How to use Paypal Express
When you choose the PayPal Express Checkout option on our site, you will be taken to your PayPal account to approve payment first. You will then return to our site, select your delivery method and click 'confirm and pay' to complete your purchase.
Do I need a Wex Photo Video account?
For speed and convenience, you can place a Paypal Express order on our site without creating a Wex account. You will also be given the option to create an account at the end of the order process.
If you place a PayPal Express order and later create a password and register with Wex, using the same email address as the PayPal Express order, you will be able to view your PayPal Express order by logging into your account online.
Can I use PayPal Express if I have a Wex Photo Video account?
If you place a PayPal Express order using an email address already registered with Wex, you will be able to view your PayPal Express order by logging into your existing Wex account.
If you log into your Wex account online and place an order using PayPal Express, this order will appear in your account online, even if you use a different email address for PayPal.
All of the above will happen automatically and can’t be changed. We will still hold and process your data for PayPal Express orders in accordance with our privacy policy.
Can I pay by cheque?
Unfortunately we no longer accept payment by cheque.
Do prices include VAT?
All prices shown are inclusive of VAT at the applicable rate. On second-hand items, when applicable, VAT is calculated under the VAT Margin Scheme, as defined by HM Revenue & Customs. Under this scheme VAT is not shown separately. Should the applicable VAT rate change, Wex Photo Video reserve the right to adjust retail prices accordingly. For items which are placed on back order, VAT will be charged at the applicable rate at time of dispatch. Our VAT number is 231 9471 12.
What happens if some items are out of stock when my order is processed?
When your order is processed we won't take payment for out of stock items until they arrive and we are able to send them to you. When an order is dispatched in multiple consignments you will only incur one charge for delivery. Finance orders and those that contain 'when bought with' promotional items can only be dispatched once everything in the order is in stock; if you need in stock items in a hurry please place a separate order for those products. For confirmation on stock availability prior to order placement please call us on 01603 486413.
