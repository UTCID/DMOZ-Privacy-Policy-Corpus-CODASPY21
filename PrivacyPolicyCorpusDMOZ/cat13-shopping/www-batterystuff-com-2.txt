Our warranty and return procedures are the main avenues for settling issues with defective merchandise and/or unwanted merchandise. However, customers still have the option to file a chargeback if they paid using a credit card. Once a customer selects a system (our returns system, our warranty procedures, or chargeback) they are required to use that system for the duration of the claim, unless the claim is reversed.
Here are the basic principles behind how Batterystuff.com manages the resolution process returns, warranties and chargebacks:
BatteryStuff.com returns department and warranties department are the primary processes for settling issues with transactions
Chargebacks override all other claims
