Privacy & Security
Hi! This is our privacy policy and, if you landed here,
it means that you want to learn how we
process your personal data at
ToyWiz.com. We wont let you down!
Essential
information we collect
In operating our store, it is essential for us to capture some
information about your device, such as
your IP address and information related to your visit when you browse
our store. For example, this
might include time-stamp, the last page or product you visited, the
indication that you logged in.
We do that in order to:
remember who you are after you log in so that you do
not need to authenticate at each
click;
monitor if our website is running with the high
performance we are dedicated to
providing;
let you browse between products without having to
start back from the home page at
each click;
display items or ads you might find
interesting;
remember if you put something in your shopping cart
before you decide to checkout; and
control that your data is processed securely.
We call the information mentioned above essential information and we
collect it through the
use of cookies. Cookies are small text files that most websites use. A
website places cookies in the
web browser and then reads the information collected through the
cookies every time the user
performs an action. We
use cookies. Without enabling this mechanism and this kind
of cookies
(first-party cookies), we could not provide you with the smooth
experience that you expect while
you are navigating.
Order information
you expressly
provide
If you buy something from our store, we will need more specific
information about you. To fully
process your order and ship the merchandise you selected, we need your
personal data such as
your first and last name, your email address and your shipping and
billing address. We also use
your contact and order information to send you communication related to
the processing of your
order. We will ask you to provide this information in our checkout
page before letting you
finalize your purchase with the payment.
Accounts
You can sign up for an account if youd like. This will make us happy
because it confirms your
interest in our store. It should also make you happy because we will
remember your information
and, when you decide to buy our products, you do not have to provide
all of your information over
again -- you just have to log-in. Before registering your account, we
will ask you to expressly
provide your consent to this privacy policy. Only if you give us your
consent, we will open your
account. We also you the possibility to easily withdraw your consent
and delete your account. Just
connect with us at the contact details at the bottom of the page.
Partial Purchases
If you have started to buy one of our products, but have not completed
the purchase, you may
have provided partial information, such as your email. In that case, we
might send you an email to
remind you about your interest. If you are not comfortable in receiving
further emails of this kind,
we will give you a simple opportunity to opt-out. Your privacy means a
lot to us and we will stop
sending you these communications right away.
Reviews
If you have completed a purchase, we may send you an email to ask you
to review the product you
bought. We want to be sure that whether you love your purchase or have
a complaint, you can
share your opinion with other customers.
Personalization
We also use some specific information related to your visit, such as
the timestamp of your visit, the
page or the product you viewed, where you are coming from (if you came
to our store because you
clicked on an advertisement or you just opened our direct link). This
is very similar to the
essential information, but we use it to provide you with a
personalized experience. The
information on your visit provides us with insights on your interests
and allows us to send you
relevant communications. We capture this information through cookies,
called a "beacon."
Newsletters
& Emails
If you sign up for our newsletters and product updates, we will use the
information you provide to us to send regular newsletters. If you have
updated your subscription profile with product preferences or if you've
purchased from our shop, you may also receive email alerts targeted to
your preferences and/or your purchase history.
How do we process
your information?
We use an external provider to run our store, BigCommerce . BigCommerce
is based in the US and
is a participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and committed to
providing best-in-class
service and data protection. You can check its participation in the

providers to provide the
most competitive services. For example:
Payment: Our store is PCI-DSS compliant (a very
strict industry standard with
requirements for the security of credit card information), and we use
an accredited
company to process your credit card information.
Shipping: We integrate with a number of shipping
companies to fulfill your orders, primarily with USPS and UPS.
Email: We integrate with approved services to process
newsletters and email updates
Partnering with highly specialized external companies allows us to

selling great products.

your personal data?

specifically selling our products to the
Member State where you are located, you have specific rights that we

your account page or if you do not have an account with us, please

your data?
We keep your data for as long as you have an account with us. We also
keep some data for security
investigation. Most importantly, we have specific obligations for fraud
detection and tax reasons.

delete it.

our services or a new legal
obligation, we will publish the new version on our website, and we will

co-registration or otherwise).

Children's Privacy
This Website is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do
not knowingly collect personal information on this Website from
children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have
inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the
age of 13, we will delete the information from our records.
Personally Identifiable Information For each user, our
web server automatically recognizes the user's domain name and IP
address, but not the e-mail address (unless supplied independently by a
user).
To qualify to receive access to the Website and/or Services, subject to
the requirements set forth in our EULA and Website Terms and
Conditions, we gather personal information from you in order to
establish your Company membership account. This information may
include, but is not necessarily limited to, your first and last name,
e-mail address, postal mailing address, mobile telephone number and
other demographic information, as well as credit/debit card information
for payment and/or age verification purposes (collectively, "Personally
Identifiable Information" or "PII". IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SUPPLY US
WITH VALID, COMPLETE, CURRENT AND ACCURATE PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION; SUCH PII WILL BE USED TO SUPPLY THE SERVICES TO YOU AND TO
COLLECT PAYMENT FOR SUCH SERVICES (WHERE APPLICABLE). By submitting
your PII, you authorize us to confirm the accuracy of the information
you submitted against government-issued identification. We may also
collect information related to your online activities to more
accurately target and measure our advertising inventory, including,
without limitation, the places you visit at the Website, content
accessed and associated marketing metrics (such as e-mails opened and
responded to) (collectively, your "Marketing Profile"). In addition, if
you choose to participate in any offer(s) available at or through the
Website, whether offered by us and/or a third party, any Personally
Identifiable Information submitted by you shall be subject to the
privacy policy(s) of the respective third party(s) collecting such PII.
In addition, you may find links to other websites from our Website.
Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the privacy
practices of any third parties and/or websites. We strongly encourage
you to be aware of when you leave our Website and/or supply your
Personally Identifiable Information to any third party, and to read the
privacy policies of each and every third party and/or website before
using such third party website(s) and/or before supplying any PII to
them. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by
this Website.
Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information Obtained by Company
You understand and agree that the Company may use and share your PII
with third parties as needed to supply the Service(s) to you. For
example, if you want to use a ringtone that you created on your mobile
device, we will transfer your mobile telephone number and the location
of the ringtone to a service provider, who will then transmit the
ringtone to your mobile device for your personal use.
You understand and agree our advertising relationships allow us to make
the Company, its Website and/or the Service(s) available to you.
Accordingly, the Personally Identifiable Information that you submit to
the Company remains your property, but by participating in the Company
Website and/or Service(s), you grant us the right to use such PII and
your Marketing Profile for multiple marketing purposes, including, but
not limited to, sharing such PII with third parties. The Company may
use such Personally Identifiable Information to (i) directly market
certain offers to you via e-mail marketing, telemarketing, direct mail,
mobile telephone text messaging (including, without limitation, SMS
and/or MMS) and other methods, (ii) to monitor compliance with our
Website EULA and Terms and Conditions, and (iii) for content
improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell your Personally
Identifiable Information that you supply to us and we may join together
with other third-party businesses to bring selected retail
opportunities to you. These businesses may include, but are not limited
to, providers of online, e-mail, telemarketing and direct mail
marketing services and applications. Such services and applications may
include, but not be limited to, lookup and reference, data enhancement,
overlay, appending, suppression and validation. By registering for
toywiz.com, you are indicating that you have read and agree to this
Privacy Policy and of its all terms and conditions, and you further
acknowledge and agree that you understand how and under what
circumstances your Personally Identifiable Information will be used.
You also agree to receive marketing promotions and other solicitations
from this Website, its advertising partners and/or other third-party
advertisers (collectively, "Website Sponsors") based on the PII you
provide on this Website, and expressly agree to be contacted by any
such Website Sponsors through direct mail, phone, pre-recorded message,
SMS text and/or email. In addition to marketing purposes, the Company
reserves the right to release your Personally Identifiable Information
if: (a) we believe that the Website and/or Service(s) is being or has
been used in violation of the EULA and/or Terms and Conditions and/or
to commit unlawful acts; (b) your Personally Identifiable Information
is subpoenaed or requested by a court, governmental agency or law
enforcement entity; or (c) the Company is sold, transferred and/or
acquired. Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any
information, record or communication from you to any third party when
the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure is
appropriate or necessary, for example, to share your e-mail address
with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with
the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. In addition,
you agree that by registering for a Company membership, such act
constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of the
Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR 310 et seq. ("Rule").
Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal
Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, the Company retains the right to
contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule. Moreover, by
registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party
advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute an
inquiry and/or application with the respective third-party advertiser
for purposes of the Rule. As such, you may be contacted via e-mail,
direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in
accordance with the Rule. To the extent that your credit card-specific
information and/or social security number is collected by the Company,
said information will be transmitted securely, kept in confidence and
will not be shared with any third parties (other than third party
service providers - such as payment processors - who provide services
to the Company and/or consumer credit agencies) without your prior
informed consent. In addition, by submitting your credit card
information to us, you authorize the Company to periodically verify by
various methods that your credit card account continues to be valid and
active, including, without limitation, charging and thereafter
immediately crediting a small sum to the credit card. Apart from the
foregoing uses, the Company and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries
reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that we/they
have credit card information on file for you, but such specific credit
card information shall not be shared by us/them with any third parties
without your prior authorization.
You may receive an e-mail confirming your membership with the Company,
co-registration with Advertisers, as well as promotional marketing of
commercial products and services. The Company reserves the right to
collect and retain data relating to e-mail marketing sent to, and
opened by, individuals on our marketing list(s).

General information collection and use - Aggregate
We gather our users' server, IP address and browser-type related
information in the general administration of our Website and
Service(s). The Company reserves the right to transfer and/or sell
aggregate or group data about the Company users for lawful purposes.
Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage
or other characteristics of the Company's users as a group, without
disclosing Personally Identifiable Information. By submitting your
Personally Identifiable Information to, and/or using, the Website
and/or Service(s), you agree to allow the Company to transfer and/or
sell such aggregate data to third parties.
Log Files
Like most website servers, we use log files. Log files include internet
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of
clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in
the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
use. Log file information is not linked to Personally Identifiable
Information.
Use of Cookies
A cookie is a text file stored on a user's hard drive containing
information about the respective user. Cookies can provide great
convenience for users at many websites and is required to use the
Company Website and Service(s). For instance, by associating a cookie
with your computer which is identified and processed by our servers,
you need not log in more than once at the Website, thereby saving time
and convenience while using our servers. In particular, we may use
persistent and/or session cookies at the Website. Persistent cookies do
not automatically expire, but persist to permit the Company to register
future visits at the Website with your profile in our servers. In
addition, cookies associated with the Company may be read, aggregated
and used with cookies associated with other affiliate Internet
properties.
In addition, we and/or third parties that advertise at the Website and
through other types of media available at or through the Website may
use cookies and pixel gifs to track and target the interests of our
users to enhance the experience on our Website and/or for advertising
tracking purposes.
Third Party Cookies
The Company delivers to your web browser many of the advertisements you
see when you use the Website. However, the Company also allows other
companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve
advertisements within and/or on the Website. Because your web browser
must request these advertising banners from the ad networks' servers,
these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as
if you had requested a web page from the Website. Please note that if
an Advertiser asks the Company to show an advertisement to a certain
audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for
example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond
to that ad, the Advertiser and/or ad-server may conclude that you fit
the description of the audience they are trying to reach. However, the
Company only authorizes our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous
cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. To the Company's
knowledge, the third-party ad servers do not collect Personally
Identifiable Information about you. In addition, the Company uses
third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for
accounting and data integrity purposes. If you want to prevent a
third-party ad server and/or third-party service provider from sending
and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad
network's and service provider's website individually and opt-out (if
they offer this capability).
Currently, we have relationships with third party service providers
and/or may display third party ad server networks (click to
visit their website). In addition, we may at some point
engage other third-party ad servers and/or third-party service
providers in the future.
You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a
cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser
is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to
change your cookie preferences. For further information on cookies
please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org.
Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online. Although we take reasonable
technological precautions to protect your Personally Identifiable
Information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
to be 100% secure. When a user submits sensitive personal and payment
information via the Website, the information is protected both online
and off-line. When our registration, download or purchase process
prompts a user to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card
number), the information is encrypted and is protected with
industry-standard encryption - SSL technology. While we use SSL
encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also use
commercially reasonable measures to protect user information off-line.
Access to user information is restricted in our offices and areas where
such information is stored. Only employees and authorized individuals
who need access to the information to perform a specific job are
granted access to Personally Identifiable Information. If you have any
questions about the security at our Website, please contact us at
security@toywiz.com.
