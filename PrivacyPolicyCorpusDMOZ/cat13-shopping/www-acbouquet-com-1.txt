Privacy Policy
At ACBouquet we do not give, sell, or divulge any of our clients' or customers' names, addresses, demographics, or personal information. All credit card and check payments via the internet are done over secure servers to ensure complete privacy. You are not required to give us any personal information that is not necessary to complete a purchase.
We will, however, ask for demographic information to help us understand you more fully and to provide you with the products and services that you rightly deserve. None of the demographic information is required and it is your right to refuse to provide any unnecessary personal information.
We understand how frustrating it can be to get unsolicited contacts from companies we have no interest in. We do not solicit people without their permission. We want you to feel safe purchasing from us.
Therefore, if you feel that we have contacted you without your consent, or are divulging your personal information to other parties, please contact us immediately. We will take you off our contact list and/or make changes to ensure your privacy.
Sincerely,
Kathy Heim, Owner
