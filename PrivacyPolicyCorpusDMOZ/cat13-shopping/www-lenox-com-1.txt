Privacy Policy
Last Updated on January 2020
Protecting your privacy is important to Lenox Corporation ("Lenox"). Lenox markets and sells products under the LENOX, DANSK and REED & BARTON brand names. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes how we collect, share and secure information provided by you on Lenox.com ("website").
By visiting our website, submitting information and/or purchasing any products, you agree to let us collect and use your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, before you provide us with any personal information, you should read through this Privacy Policy in its entirety and understand its terms. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check it occasionally. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, made subject to and is governed by, that certain Terms and Conditions ("Terms") by and between us and you ("you").
This website is not intended to sell or ship products to customers outside of the United States. If you wish to do so, please visit one of our authorized resellers.
I. Information We CollectThere are three general categories of information we collect: information you voluntarily provide, information we obtain when you use our website (collectively "services") and information we collect through third parties or public sources.
A. Information You Voluntarily ProvideWhen you interact with us, we collect information that you voluntarily share with us. For example, you may give us your personally identifiable information, which includes, but is not limited to, identifiers such as your name, username and password, address (postal and email), telephone number (“Personal Information”) by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. When you communicate with us, we will collect whatever information you volunteer. You should therefore not send messages or share content that you do not want us to see, save or share.
B. Information We Get When You Use Our Website or ServicesWhen you use our website, we collect information about you and your use of the website. For example, we collect the following types of information when you use our website or services:
• Personal Information
We may collect certain Personal Information when you use our website, place an order or provide information to us, such as when you create an account, fill out registration forms, visit our retail stores, register for our Lenox Replacement Promise, enter a contest or marketing event, sign up for a catalog, or otherwise contact us. The information we may collect includes the following information: name, address, email phone number, and credit card information. While we provide our consumers the convenience of purchasing products through a credit card, we do not take possession of our consumers’ credit card information. Rather, that information is provided directly to a third party service provider for processing. Accordingly, the Personal Information retained by Lenox does not include consumers’ credit card information or number.
If you register for our Lenox Replacement Promise you also have the option of providing your birthday and wedding date as well as registered products. If you use our "Email to a Friend" feature, the name and email address information requested will be used only to generate that email. It will not be used for any other purpose.
• Usage InformationWe collect information about your activity on our website and how you interact with our services, such as viewing or purchase of our products.
• System Information
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access our website or services, such as your IP address and unique device identifiers.
• Information Collected by Cookies and Other TechnologiesWe may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. If you remove or reject cookies, it could affect the availability and functionality of our services. For more information about cookies, please visit: www.allaboutcookies.org.
• Google AnalyticsWe collect information through a platform called Google Analytics which utilizes cookies (which are information stored on your computer by your browser to save your preferences while you are visiting a particular site) when you visit us. This tracking data is used for many purposes including, for example, to provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to our site; to deliver relevant content based on your preferences, usage patterns and location; monitor and evaluate the use and operation of our site; and to analyze traffic on our site and the sites of third parties. You may opt-out from Google Analytics tracking the activity of your browser with this add-on: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. You may choose whether to have your information collected for that purpose; but not allowing that collection may result in you not being able to use all of the features of our site.
• Information We Get From Other SourcesWe may from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties. For example, we may also receive technical data from analytics providers such as Google Analytics.
II. What We Do With Your InformationWe will use information provided by you or collected consistent with this Policy for the business purposes of personalizing your experience, enhancing our services, carrying out marketing communications, providing information about our policies, enforcing our policies and/or otherwise carrying out our business.

IV. Third Parties & Links To Third Party SitesOur website may contain content that is supplied by a third party. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by third parties or their services.

We have no control over, and cannot and do not assume responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of such websites or the companies that own them. V. Security
We seek to use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personally identifiable information under our control. For information on how we protect your privacy when you order our products online, see the Secure Shopping section above.
Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that your information will remain secure.When registering an account, it is your responsibility to choose an account password that is difficult for others to guess, preferably a password you do not use on any other website or account, and never reveal it to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, DO NOT choose to have your login ID or password remembered and log out of your account completely every time you leave the computer.

We will post the updated version on our websites and indicate at the top of the Privacy Policy when it was last updated.
Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder we will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.

Our amended Privacy Policy will automatically take effect upon the date that an update is published. If you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you should cease using our services.

IX. Additional Privacy Information For California Users
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Please make sure you also consult our general privacy policy above for complete information.
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to request that Lenox disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you:
The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.
The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
If we sold or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Request RightsYou have the right to request that Lenox delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the deletion of the information may likely render impossible or seriously impair the objectives of the research, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion RightsTo exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
Clicking on this link, completing the CCPA Request Form and sending it to us through this site.
Emailing us at info@lenox.com;
Calling our Customer service department at 800-225-1779;
Sending a letter to us at: Lenox Customer Service, Lenox P.O. Box 735, Bristol, PA 19007-0806
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.No Sale of Personal InformationLenox does not sell your personal information.
Non DiscriminationWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
X.  Other California Privacy RightsAs referenced in this Privacy Policy, we may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us on the Service with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us to, under certain circumstances, request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at info@lenox.com.
