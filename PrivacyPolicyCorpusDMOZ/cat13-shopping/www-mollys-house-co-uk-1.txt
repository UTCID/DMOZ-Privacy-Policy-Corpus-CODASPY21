Welcome to A Trifle Small Miniatures
Welcome to A Trifle Small. I specialise in smaller scale dolls house miniatures for collectors. My online shop has a large selection of
1/24th scale and 1/48th scale miniatures, also known as half scale and quarter scale respectively.
Start with the dolls house, decorate with wallpaper or tiles. Add lighting, and choose from many items of furniture and then add accessories for that finishing touch. Kits, ready made, hand made, luxury and economy for all tastes and budgets.
I have recently introduced and hoping to expand on some 1/144th scale.
If you're confused over the different scales? Take a look at my Which Scale? page for help and more information.
