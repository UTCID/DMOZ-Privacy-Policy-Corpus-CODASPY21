Protica Research Corporation (Protica) is concerned for the privacy of its visitors to Protica web sites. The following statement generally describes the types of information collected at Protica's sites and the uses made of it.
Personally Identifiable Information
Protica Research Corporation collects personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information only when it is voluntarily submitted to us on this site. The portion of such information where you may describe for purposes of placing an order is held and processed under secure conditions at Protica (or at an agent of Protica) with access limited to appropriate Protica staff or other authorized agents having a requirement to maintain the confidentiality of the information. Protica uses or discloses personally identified information only with the visitor's consent or other legal authorization. The intended uses of the information are provided at the site where the information is collected. We may use the information to improve the content of our web site. We will not sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third party for that party's marketing purposes.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Protica Research Corporation also collects aggregate or non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our web sites, the number of visitors to each page of our web sites, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use our web sites so that we may make them better. We may also share this information with our partners or other outside companies. NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROCESS.

Protica Research Corporation web sites may provide links to other web sites as a service to our viewers. We believe these web sites provide helpful information. However, Protica does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of third-party sites. Nor does Protica have any control over the information you may choose to provide to these sites.
The privacy policy described here does not apply to those sites.
