ORDERING INFORMATION & TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Our Pricing Policy
The base currency on our site is UK Sterling. You can view prices in other c-urrencies by selecting from the list of currencies displayed. Prices in other currencies are approximate and for guidance only.
We reserve the right to amend prices without notice.
All items are listed subject to availability and include UK vat where applicable.
Payment Options
We accept all major credit and debit cards.
If you select to pay with Skrill, you can choose to pay with a card type exclusive to the country you reside in and you will be charged in your local currency.
We also accept payment by Paypal, UK cheques & UK Postal Orders in Sterling only.
Stock Availability & 'Request Next Available Copy'
You can 'request next available copy' where indicated. You will be directed to complete the checkout process so that we can obtain your contact details. No payment is required for 'request next' items. If we locate the item in future, or a very similar copy, we will contact you and give you the opportunity to purchase the item. You are under no obligation to purchase at a future date.
Stock is subject to availability. By its very nature, rare and out of print items are generally only held as single items. Our site is live and updates stock availability as items are added and sold. Orders are filled on a first come first served basis.
Our Delivery Aims
All orders are despatched within 24 hours Monday to Friday, or 48 hours over a weekend. We will email to confirm despatch and provide a tracking number only if you have selected to pay for a tracking service. Delivery times vary from destination to destination; contact us if you need specific information.
Your Right to Cancel Your Order
You can cancel your order within seven days from the time payment is completed. You must write, fax or email and obtain confirmation that your order has been cancelled. If the order has already been despatched, then we will advise how you may return it to us or read about 'Returning an Item'.
Returning an Item
If you need to return an item to us, you should contact us for a returns authorisation. We will advise how best to return it. Returns will only be accepted if received within 28 days from the date of delivery.
You must take reasonable care to ensure that an item is repackaged so that it arrives back in the same condition it was despatched.
We cannot take responsibility for damage to insufficiently repackaged items, or items that have been used or badly handled before being returned. We may only refund postage, when approved, for the use of standard mail services. Your parcel must be accompanied by a copy of our returns authorisation email, your invoice or a covering letter containing your order information.
Returns should be made only to the address shown on your invoice.
Non Delivery
Unless UK next day delivery is chosen, we will ask you to wait a reasonable amount of time for your parcel to arrive. This will vary depending on your destination but typically Royal Mail requires that 28 days be allowed for delivery. It is rare in our experience that items go missing entirely, but occasionally they are delayed by a few days. If your order has not arrived after 28 days we will discuss a replacement, store credit or refund with you and arrange this without further delay.
How To Contact Us

What Are Cookies And Our Cookie Policy
We and our business partners collect information about your use of our online services using cookies. Cookies are very small files that are sent by us to your computer or other device which we can access when you visit our site in future. Cookies help us remember who you are and other information about your visits. They can help display the information on a website in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies.
Some cookies on this site are essential, and the web site won't work as expected without them. For example without the temporary cookies we use you would not be able to add items to your basket and make a purchase. We give you the option to choose if you would like to have your customer ID remembered to make it easier for you to place an order (we do not recommend setting the "Remember Me" option on if you are using a shared computer/internet access device). This information also enables us to show you products by your favourite artists when you visit the web site.
Every now and again, we may ask you for your opinion on our services and the products you have purchased through our services. When we do research or surveys, we may use cookies and may combine the information collected by those cookies with your answers.
What is a cookie and what does it do?
A cookie is a small file that is sent to the browser and saved on your device when you visit a website like www.stellamccartney.com ("the website"). Cookies allow the site to function efficiently and improve its services, in addition to providing information to the site owner for statistical or advertising purposes, primarily to personalize your navigation experience by remembering your preferences (for example, remembering the language and currency you set, in order to recognize you at the next visit, etc.)
Which cookies do we use and why?
Our website uses various types of first party cookies (organised and managed by the Esprit Group Of Companies), and third party cookies (organised and managed by third parties based on their own individual privacy policies and not under the control of the Esprit Group Of Companies) and similar technologies, each of which has a specific function. Below is a table explaining them.
Types of cookie

If you are a registered user, they will allow you to be recognized and to access the services offered from the dedicated areas. Navigation cookies are technical cookies and are needed for the functioning of the website.
Functional cookies
These cookies allow, based on your express request, for you to be recognized when you subsequently access the website, so that you do not have to enter your information each time (for example: "Remember me"). If you have added items into your Shopping Bag and closed the session without completing the purchase and without eliminating those items, these cookies allow you to continue the shopping experience the next time you access the website (within a limited period), finding the same articles that were selected. Functional cookies are not essential to the functioning of the website, but rather improve navigation quality and experience.
Analytical cookies
These first party cookies are the property of the Esprit Group Of Companies (the site manager) and are used to collect data in an anonymous and aggregate way.

We collate information about site traffic, sales, wish lists, and other commercial information which we may pass onto third parties, but this information does not include any details which can identify you personally.
Where We Process Your Personal Information

When we do this, we make sure that appropriate steps are taken to protect your personal information and your rights. By providing us with your personal information, you agree that we may transfer, store and process your information outside the EEA.

Safeguarding Your Personal Information
We will take reasonable care to maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided to us. We have put in place technology and security policies which are designed to protect the personal information we hold about you. We also follow the security procedures that applicable privacy laws require. These including storing, using and releasing any information you have provided and, as well as measures designed to prevent unauthorised access or use. When you place an order or access your account information, we use a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption which encrypts your information before it is sent to us to protect it from unauthorised use.
Why We Link To Other Websites
Our online services contain hyperlinks to websites that are owned and operated by other organisations. These websites have their own privacy and cookie policies, and we urge you to read them. They control how your personal information is used when you give it to these other organisations or they collect it with cookies. We do not approve any other websites and we are not responsible for any information, material, products or services that are on or accessible through those websites or for the privacy practices of websites run by other organisations. If you use these other websites you do so at your own risk.
Our partnership with Trustpilot for online reviews
We link to Trustpilot to enable customers to provide reviews to Trustpilot's review invitation service, which works as follows: The company adds a specific Trustpilot email address on all of the company's order confirmation emails or similar using the blind carbon copy ("Bcc"). From those Bcc emails, Trustpilot automatically retrieves the consumer's information that is needed to send out review invitation emails to consumers on behalf of the company. The only information collected and used by Trustpilot to send out the review invitation emails are the reference number, name and email address of the consumer. The Bcc emails are automatically deleted from Trustpilot's systems after 30 days. Trustpilot processes data on the Esprit Group Of Company's behalf when sending out review invitations to the our customers. The company is the Data Controller and therefore we only act in accordance with the instructions that we receive from the company.
If you click on the link received in the review invitation email you will be redirected to Trustpilot's review page where you must actively accept their terms & conditions and privacy policy before any information relating to your review can be saved. All information collected about the user from this time and going forward is collected by Trustpilot as a Data Controller. The reason why Trustpilot may save this information is for example so that they can contact a customer if his/her review violates Trustpilot's User Guidelines.
