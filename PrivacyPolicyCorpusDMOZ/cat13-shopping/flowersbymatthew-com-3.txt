We will make every effort to maintain a consistent "look and feel" of the arrangement by taking into account the overall shape, size, style, and color combinations. In single-variety arrangements the variety will take precedence over color. For example, if an order is for red carnations, they will substitute another color of carnations, not another red flower. White roses and cream roses may be substituted for each other as well as peach roses and pink roses. Various colors of orchids may need to be substituted for either other as well.
