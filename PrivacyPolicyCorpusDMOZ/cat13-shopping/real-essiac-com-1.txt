Congratulations.You Have Come to the Right Place for Genuine Organic Essiac Tea!
Essiac tea as seen on Ty Bollinger's documentary The Truth About Cancer. Be careful when comparing price with companies who sell only a week or two's worth at a time - we sell enough to last months at a time which saves you a ton of money.**Click here to Order Essiac**Your first concern when choosing essiac tea should be whether or not the formula is from a credible source. After all, what is the point of taking if it's not the real deal?
we include the sheep sorrel root in our essiac
We include the entire sheep sorrel root in our formula. This means that the sheep sorrel is 20% root, just as Rene Caisse recommended. Click here to read more about it.
Rene Caisse is the Canadian Nurse for whom essiac is named (it's her last name spelled backwards!)
essiac bought on amazon costs around four times as much per serving!
Check out the savings when you order through this site rather than on Amazon!
We believe in our essiac so much,we Guarantee It!
Here is a testimonial from a man who had a growth on his scalp that was inoperable.
Please watch the video below to find out more about our essiac tea!
Our Proven Formula comes from Rene Caisse, the Founder of Essiac
Rene Caisse and Dr. Charles Brusch spent eight years studying this herbal remedy at the Brusch Medical Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Dr. Brusch later became our colleague and he passed the essiac tea formula along to our family.
You'll Love the Results! Additional Herbs Enhance the Original Essiac Tea Formula
Rene Cassise and Dr. Charles Brusch researched essiac tea from 1959 to 1967 and found that one essiac formula consistently outperformed all others. This formula included the original four essiac herbs combined with an additional four herbs that maximized the effectiveness when this formula is taken as a tea.
Check out our proof of authenticity letter from Dr. Charles Brusch, Rene Caisse's research assistant at the Brusch Medical Research Center in Cambridge, MA.
Why you need to know the truth about the "original" four herb essiac
When a company says they have four herb essiac which is the "Original" Essiac, they are telling that part of the truth correctly. However, they are leaving out the part that the four herb formula is an older one that was found to be less effective than the most up-to-date eight herb formula that was developed by Rene Caisse and Dr. Charles Brusch.
how the paulhus family makes it easy for you to get the best essiac money can buy.
Being from the same area, our family was fortunate enough to be introduced to Dr. Charles Brusch through a common friend. As Dr. Brusch grew older he saw our family as the people who could take over the job of making essiac available to everyone, since over the years we had demonstrated our commitment to referring others to essiac and to keeping the price affordable.
the paulhus family carries on rene caisse and dr. brusch's mission
Dr. Charles Brusch passed on the formula to our family so that we could distribute it to whomever may need it. His wish was that we keep prices as low as possible so that more people could have access to it. It is a tragic thing for essiac to not be available to those in need due to financial concerns and our company will not allow that to happen. Which brings me to...
we give away free essiac to those in need.
In fact, we are so determined to get essiac to those who need it that we will provide some at a reduced rate or even free of charge to you if you have a financial need (in most instances you will be responsible to cover the shipping cost for international orders). All you have to do is ask.
our money-back guarantee and price-match guarantee make it easy for you to give essiac a try today.
