PRIVACY POLICY
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Privacy Policy
EFFECTIVE DATE: January 15, 2018
By accessing and/or using the LOOP JEWELRY web site (www.loopjewelry.com), the LOOP JEWELRY service, and/or any
programs, web sites, applications, software, and/or platforms made available by, on, through, or in connection with
the LOOP JEWELRY web site and/or the LOOP JEWELRY service (together, the “Service”), however accessed, you
understand and agree that your and other users’ access to and use of the Service shall be consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at
www.loopjewelry.com/pages/terms-conditions). By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the collection, use,
disclosure, and procedures described in this Privacy Policy.
The Service is owned and controlled by DTC Digital, Inc. (“DTC”). If you have any questions or concerns regarding
this Privacy Policy, please contact DTC at loopcare@loopjewelry.com.
A. Information We Collect
1. Information you provide us directly.
The Service will collect any and all information you enter when creating a user account and/or placing an order with
the Service, including but not limited to:
Your username and password.
Profile information that you provide (e.g., your name, age, date of birth, ZIP code, and email address).
Information from your browser, including, but not limited to, your IP address, cookie information, and hardware
& software attributes.
Communications between you and DTC. For example, we may send you service-related emails (e.g., user account
verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not
opt out of service-related emails.
Payment information (e.g., credit card number, type, and expiration date; billing address; shipping address).
PLEASE NOTE our payment processor, which is required by credit card issuers to meet specific security
requirements, will collect, store, and process your credit card and other payment information on our behalf
using industry-standard security measures. We do not store any payment card information.
2. Analytics information.
The Service may employ third-party analytics tools to help measure traffic and usage trends. These tools collect
information sent by your device on our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information
that assists in improving the Service. This analytics information is collected and used with analytics information
from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.
3. Cookies and similar technologies.
The Service may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect
information about how you use the Service and provide features to you. In addition, DTC may ask advertisers or other
partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by DTC or
the third party.
4. Log file information.
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access a web page or
app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. When
you use our Service, our servers may automatically record certain log file information, including your web request,
IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the
Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. Similar information may also be
collected from emails sent to our users which helps track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by
recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
5. Device identifiers.
When you access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or
more “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or
associated with you device, which uniquely identify your device. A device identifier may be data stored in
connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software,
or data sent to the device by the Service. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party
partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content
and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is
impaired or disabled.
6. Metadata.
Metadata is usually technical data that is typically associated with User Submitted Content (as defined in our Terms
of Use, which can be found at www.loopjewelry.com/pages/terms-conditions). For example, metadata can describe how,
when and by whom a piece of User Submitted Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
B. How We Use Your Information
Any information collected may be used for the following general purposes:
Customization of users’ experience while using the Service
Order fulfillment
Delivery services
Payment processing
Account registration
Website-related services, such as web hosting
Improvement and maintenance of the Service and its functionality

Relevant marketing research
In addition, information received may be used to:

Remember information so users will not have to re-enter it
Provide personalized content and information, including online ads or other forms of marketing
Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of the Service

C. Sharing Of Your Information
DTC will not rent or sell your information to, or otherwise share your information with, third parties without your
consent, except as noted in this Privacy Policy:
i. We may share your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device
identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies
that DTC is part of, or that become part of such group (“DTC Affiliates”). The DTC Affiliates may use this
information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and the DTC
Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).
ii. We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (“Service
Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide
the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
iii. We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This
information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
believe will be of most interest to you.
iv. We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also
combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that
aggregated information.
D. What Happens in the Event of a Change of Control:
If DTC sells or otherwise transfers part or the whole of the Service or its assets to another organization (e.g., in
the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information
submitted through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. The buyer or transferee will have to honor
the commitments made in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at
www.loopjewelry.com/pages/terms-conditions).
E. Responding to Legal Requests & Preventing Harm:
We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order
or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal
requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is
required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally
recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is
necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others,
including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you
may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or
obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies,
or otherwise to prevent harm.
F. How We Store Your Information
Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country
in which DTC, the DTC Affiliates, or their Service Providers maintain facilities.
DTC, the DTC Affiliates, and/or their Service Providers may transfer information that they collect, including
personal information, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions
around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and
use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to
a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
By accessing, using, and/or registering a user account with the Service, you consent to the transfer of information
to the U.S. or to any other country in which DTC, the DTC Affiliates, and/or their Service Providers maintain
facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take
reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your
user account. However, DTC cannot ensure the security of any information or content you submit via the Service, or
guarantee that information or content submitted via the Service will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
destroyed.
Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and user
account information, and for controlling access to communications between you and DTC, at all times.
G. Modifying Your Personal Information
You may update your user account or information provided in connection with your account at any time by logging in
and changing your profile information or settings. If you have any further questions about reviewing or modifying
your user account information or settings, please contact us directly at loopcare@loopjewelry.com.
You can also permanently delete your user account. If you have any questions about termination or deactivation of
your user account, please contact us directly at loopcare@loopjewelry.com.
H. How Long We Keep Your User Information/Content
Following termination or deactivation of your user account, DTC, the DTC Affiliates, and/or their Service Providers,
may retain information and/or content submitted via the Service (including, without limitation, user account
information) for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes. If you have any
questions about termination or deactivation of your user account, please contact us directly at
loopcare@loopjewelry.com.
I. Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
persons to register for the Service. The Service is not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that
we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will
delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a
child under 13, please contact us at loopcare@loopjewelry.com.
J. Other Web Sites and Services
DTC is not responsible for practices employed by any web sites, applications, platforms, or services linked to or
from the Service, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a
link to go from our Service to another web site, application, platform or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply
to those third-party web sites, applications, platforms and services. Your browsing and interaction on any
third-party web site, application, platform or service, including those that have a link in the Service, are subject
to that third party’s own rules and policies. If you are using a third-party web site, application, platform or
service, you do so at your own risk.
K. Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident and would like a copy of our notice describing what categories of personal
information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for their direct marketing purposes and the names
and addresses of the third parties and affiliates that received your information in the past year, please submit a
written request to DTC at the following address: loopcare@loopjewelry.com.
Please allow up to 30 days for us to process your request. You may submit such a request once per year.

additional forms of notice of modifications or updates if any significant changes are made to the policy by sending

not be liable for any use of disclosure of any User Submitted Content.

3. You may not attempt to grain unauthorized access to any portion, aspect, or element of the Service or any Content,
or any other systems or networks connected to the Service or to any DTC server, or to any of the services offered on
or through the Service, by hacking, password “mining”, or any other illegitimate or illicit means.
4. You may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service or any network connected to the Service, nor

to DTC.

8. Although it is DTC’s intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there may be occasions when
the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency
repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. You acknowledge and agree that DTC will not
be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service, or for the loss of any User
Submitted Content. You also acknowledge and agree that the internet may be subject to breaches of security, and that
the submission of User Submitted Content or other content, materials, or information via the Service therefore may
not be secure.
H. PRODUCT INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE
1. DTC makes every effort to ensure that the Service is as accurate and complete as possible at all times. However,
from time to time, information or materials on the Service concerning products, including but not limited to prices,
may be out of date or inaccurate due to system, typographical, or other errors. While we make every attempt to avoid
these errors, they do occur. DTC reserves the right to discontinue or change descriptions, images, references,
features, content, specifications, prices, and availability of products offered on or though the Service at any time
without prior notice, in its sole discretion. The inclusion of any product on the Service at a particular time does
not imply or warrant that such product will be available at any other time. DTC further reserves the right to
refrain from honoring inaccurate or erroneous prices, even after an order has been placed; errors in advertised
prices are not binding on DTC, and may be adjusted by DTC at any time. DTC shall have the right to refuse or cancel
orders placed for a product listed at the incorrect price, regardless of whether the order has been confirmed and
your credit card charged. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any questions about any
product, please do not hesitate to contact us at loopsquad@loopjewelry.com.
2. DTC makes reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable sizes
and colors. However, some products displayed on the Service may appear larger or smaller than their actual size in
our photographs, and, since every computer monitor is set differently, color and size may vary slightly.
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that your screen will accurately display product colors and sizes.
3. In compliance with industry standards and FTC regulations, DTC states that carat total weight in all purchases may
vary 0.05 carats from stated weight.
I. PURCHASE ORDERS
1. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD TO MAKE A PURCHASE ORDER THROUGH THE SERVICE WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF A PARENT
OR GUARDIAN. BY SUBMITTING A PURCHASE ORDER THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18
YEARS OLD. If DTC discovers or is of the opinion (as to which DTC shall have sole discretion) that you are not
legally entitled to make certain purchases through the Service, DTC shall be entitled to cancel your order
immediately, without notice.
2. If you wish to purchase a product offered for sale through the Service, we will ask you to supply certain
information applicable to your purchase, including, without limitation, payment and other informat
ion. Any such information will be treated as described in our Privacy Policy (available at
www.loopjewelry.com/pages/privacy). All information that you provide to us or to our third-party payment processor
must be accurate, current, and complete. BY SUBMITTING A PURCHASE ORDER THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT AND
WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO INITIATE ANY
TRANSACTION. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any user of you account and credit card (or other
applicable payment mechanism) at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible
for paying any applicable shipping costs and/or taxes relating to your purchases. All purchase orders through the
Service are subject to credit approval. Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior
to our acceptance of any order.
3. DTC reserves the right, for any reason in its sole discretion and at any time after receiving your order, to
accept, refuse, place on hold, decline, or cancel any order you submit to us even after your receipt of an order
confirmation. (Understand that your receipt of an email order confirmation does not signify DTC’s acceptance of your
order or a confirmation of our offer to sell, but rather is simply an acknowledgement that we received your order.)
DTC reserves the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any product;
to bar any user from making any or all purchase(s); and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product. DTC shall
not be liable to anyone for withdrawing any product from the Service or for refusing to accept any order.
4. After receiving your order, DTC may contact you to request clarification, additional or missing information
regarding your order or your account. It is your sole responsibility to deliver the additional information to DTC in
a timely manner. DTC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place your order on hold or cancel your order if
the requested information is not received in a timely and complete manner. Orders placed on hold will be
automatically cancelled 15 days after being submitted if there’s missing information.
5. In the event DTC changes or cancels an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the email address and/or
phone number provided at the time the order was submitted. If your order is cancelled, DTC will issue a refund
according to these terms.
6. Purchases of commercial quantities of products through the Service is not permitted without DTC’s prior written
authorization. DTC reserves the right to place further limits or restrictions on product orders in its sole
discretion.
J. SHIPPING & DELIVERY
1. Standard domestic shipping for orders placed through the Service is always free. Shipping fees only apply to
expedited domestic shipping options.
2. DTC presently cannot offer international shipping (though we hope to soon).
3. From the minute DTC receives your order, it takes up to three (3) weeks to make your ring and get it shipped out
to you. DTC will send you tracking information for your package and updates on its shipping progress.
4. Your ring will be fully insured while in transit, from the time it is shipped from DTC’s headquarters to the time
you receive and sign for it.
5. Because our rings are high-value items, your package will need to be signed for at the shipping address upon
delivery; customers are responsible for coordinating and accepting delivery from the shipping carrier.
6. All estimated shipping dates regarding your order provided by DTC are for reference only, and shall not be
considered a guarantee, warranty, or commitment by DTC that your order will be delivered on that date. Since the
actual delivery of your order may be impacted by events beyond DTC’s control once it has shipped, DTC cannot be held
liable for late deliveries.
K. LIFETIME MANUFACTURING DEFECT WARRANTY
1. DTC offers a lifetime guarantee on rings purchased through the Service. If there’s an issue with your ring down
the road due to a manufacturing defect, DTC will always fix or replace it. (To be clear, this warranty only covers
manufacturing defects; any damage to rings purchased through the Service subsequent to delivery is expressly
excluded.) If you believe your ring has a manufacturing defect subject to this guarantee, please contact us at
loopcare@loopjewelry.com to arrange for shipment of your ring to us. We will cover shipping, take a look at your
ring, and contact you within 48 hours to let you know how we can help.
L. LIFETIME ANNUAL CLEANING & MAINTENANCE
1. DTC also offers complementary cleaning and maintenance for purchased through the Service once a year, every year
following your purchase. If you would like to arrange for your annual cleaning and maintenance of your ring, please
contact us at loopcare@loopjewelry.com to arrange for shipment of your ring to us. We will cover shipping, clean
your ring and give it a check-up to make sure everything is secure. Then, if no additional work is needed, we’ll
send it back to you within 3 business days.
M. ORDER CHANGES, RETURNS, & CANCELLATIONS
1.	DTC will do everything we can to get you the right ring.
But, if something is off with your ring, we will make it right or take it back.
2.	So long as the ring is in original unworn condition, with all packaging and documentation (including the original GIA Certificate that accompanied your order), DTC allows returns anytime before 100 days following the date your order is delivered to you, no questions asked.
3.	DTC will cover all shipping costs for returns – however, please do not ship us anything to be returned without contacting us first at loopcare@loopjewelry.com, as we will send you all necessary shipping and packaging materials for you to use to complete the return.
Please note that returns will only be processed for rings sent to us with LOOP pre-authorized labels and packaging.
4.	DTC also allows order changes and cancellations anytime before your order is shipped.
5.	After an order is returned or cancelled, you can expect to receive your refund within 7-10 business days.
6.	If you would like to return, change, or cancel an order, please contact us at loopcare@loopjewelry.com for further instructions and arrangements.
N. THIRD PARTY LINKS PROVIDED ON THE SERVICE
If the Service contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for
your convenience only. Such links may include links contained in advertisements, including banner advertisements and
sponsored links. DTC has no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and accept no responsibility for
them or for any loss or damages that may arise from your use or access thereof. If you choose to access any third
party program, web site, application, software, and/or platform linked to this Service, you do so entirely at your
own risk, and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such program, web site, application, software, and/or
platform.
O. ADVERTISEMENTS AND PROMOTIONS ON THE SERVICE
DTC may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Service. Your business dealings or correspondence
with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers other than DTC, and any terms, conditions, warranties, or
representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third party. DTC is not responsible
or liable for any loss or damage whatsoever incurred as a result of any such dealings or as the result of the
presence of such non- DTC advertisers on the Service.
P. DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT

PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY ANY OF THE DTC DISCLAIMING PARTIES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE SERVICE), AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION,
DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY PROGRAM, WEB SITE, APPLICATION, SOFTWARE, PLATFORM,

OR SERVICE THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE CLAIM. (NOTE: SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.)
S. INDEMNIFICATION
1. You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or conduct any activity on the Service) agree to
defend (at DTC’S request), indemnify, and hold harmless DTC, its independent contractors and consultants, and their
respective directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses,
including without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any
of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf):
(a) your access or use of the Service, including but not limited to with respect to User Submitted Content; (b) your
purchases, orders, and transactions with DTC; (c) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use (including,
without limitation, breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, or obligation set forth herein); (d)
your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity,
confidentiality, property or privacy right; (e) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes,
ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all
regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (f) any misrepresentation made by you.
2. You will cooperate as fully required by DTC in the defense of any such claim. DTC reserves the right to assume the
exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle
any claim without the prior written consent of DTC.
T. ARBITRATION
1. For any dispute you have with DTC, you agree to first contact us at loopcare@loopjewelry.com and attempt to
resolve the dispute informally.
2. For any dispute that cannot be resolved informally, you agree that any dispute that you have with DTC (whether or
not such dispute involves a third party), including, without limitation, disputes related to these Terms of Use,
your use of the Service, and/or copyright, trademark, publicity and/or privacy rights, will be resolved by binding,
individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related
disputes, and you hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local
“small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
Neither you nor DTC will participate in class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms
of Use. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative
capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if DTC is a party to the proceeding. This
dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration
Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case,
then either DTC or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent
jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award
damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.
3. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties set forth hereinabove
is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.
This Arbitration provision of the Terms of Use will survive the termination of your relationship with DTC.
4. DTC reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to
disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the
termination of any or all of your transactions with DTC.
U. TIME LIMITATION ON CLAIMS
You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to the Service and/or your relationship with DTC must
be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
V. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
1. These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable United
States federal law, and the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of
law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE
OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE.
2. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, you agree to
resolve any dispute you have with DTC exclusively in a United States state or federal court located in the State of
New York, and to irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the
State of New York for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.
3. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during
arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms
of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. DTC’s failure to insist upon
or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of any other
provision or right set forth in these Terms of Use. No waiver of any of these Terms of Use will be deemed a further
or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use.
Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use.
4. The parties to these Terms of Use are independent contractors with respect to each other.
These Terms of Use do not constitute and shall not be construed as constituting the parties as principal and agent, employer and employee, partners, joint venturers, or any similar relationship. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights other than as expressly provided for herein.
Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in performing these Terms of Use.
5. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Use, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of DTC.
Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of DTC will be null and void.
DTC may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent.
Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
6. The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject DTC to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
DTC reserves the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in their sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature provided within the Service.
7. DTC does not represent or warrant that the Service or any part thereof or any products offered through the Service is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction.
Those who choose to access the Service do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.
8. Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls.
Thus, no software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders.
By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.
9. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and DTC regarding the Service and governs your access and use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and DTC regarding the Service.
