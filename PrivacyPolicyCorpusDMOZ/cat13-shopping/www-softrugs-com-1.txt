Please note that the guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions of
service and use of other web sites affiliated with SoftRugs may vary from these
Terms. If a SoftRugs affiliate has separate terms of use for its website(s), or
a separate agreement governing its use, the provisions of the affiliate site's
terms shall control in the event of a conflict with these Terms. Except as
supplemented or superseded as described herein, these Terms apply to the entire

Eligibility
The SoftRugs Site is not targeted towards, nor
intended for use by, anyone under the age of 18. By using the SoftRugs Site,
you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. If you are not

ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND SOFTRUGS RELATING
IN ANY WAY TO THE SOFTRUGS SITE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDERS MADE FROM
THE SOFTRUGS SITE, SOFTRUGS’ ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL AND MOBILE
SMS (TEXT) MESSAGES SOFTRUGS SENDS TO YOU, OR RELATING TO THE COLLECTION OR USE
OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTRUGS SITE), THESE
TERMS, OR YOUR STATUS AS A USER WILL BE SUBMITTED TO CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION
IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN WHICH YOU RESIDE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
YOU HAVE, IN ANY WAY, VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE ANY COMPANY
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.
Any User who intends to seek arbitration must
first send to SoftRugs, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
("Notice"). The Notice must be mailed to 13664 Greenwood Trail Court
N., Stillwater, MN 55082, Attn: Arbitration Intake. The Notice shall describe
the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought.
If we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after
the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.
All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the rules then
prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s award is
binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law no arbitration brought under, or
with respect to, the SoftRugs Site (including, without limitation, any SoftRugs
advertisement or disclosure, any email or mobile SMS (text) message that SoftRugs
sends to you, the collection or use of any information about you in connection

to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms whether
through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless SoftRugs and you
agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one User’s
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative,
private attorney general or class proceeding.
For arbitration claims you assert against SoftRugs in accordance with this
section (but not for any arbitration claim against you) SoftRugs will pay all
of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator’s fees and costs for the
arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or
witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to
file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater)
in the judicial district in which you reside. Unless unlawful, SoftRugs will
pay its, and you will pay your, lawyers’, experts’, and witness fees, expenses,
and costs with respect to all claims. The arbitrator may award money or
equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only
to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply
only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to
enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration,
the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award
unless requested to do so by all parties.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT
AGREE TO ACT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN
ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST SOFTRUGS IN ANY COURT, OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT TO
ANY CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SOFTRUGS SITE (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION ORDERS MADE FROM THE SOFTRUGS SITE, SOFTRUGS’ ADVERTISEMENTS AND
DISCLOSURES, EMAIL AND MOBILE SMS (TEXT) MESSAGES SOFTRUGS SENDS TO YOU, OR
RELATING TO THE COLLECTION OR USE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION
