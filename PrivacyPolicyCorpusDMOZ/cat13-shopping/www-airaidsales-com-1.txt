altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a
business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our
instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put
in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and
will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are
legally required to do so.
8. EU Data Subjects Terms
Privacy Rights
EU data subjects have certain rights with respect to your personal data
that we collect and process. We respond to all requests we receive from
individuals in the EEA wishing to exercise their data protection rights in
accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Access, Correction or Deletion
. You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your
personal data. You can often go directly into the Service under Account
Settings to take these actions.
Please note that even if you request for your personal data to be deleted,
certain aspects may be retained for us to: meet our legal or regulatory
compliance (e.g. maintaining records of transactions you have made with
us); exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and to protect against
fraudulent or abusive activity on our Service. Data retained for these
purposes will be handled as described in “Data Retention” subsection,
below.
Objection
. You may object to processing of your personal data where we are
relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there
is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
rights and freedoms.
Restriction
. You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your
personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is

hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to
our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
legitimate grounds to use it.
Portability
. You have the right to request the transfer of your personal data to
you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you
have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated
information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw Consent
. If we have collected and processed your personal data with your
consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your
consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted
prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your
personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other
than consent.
File a complaint
. You have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority
about our collection and processing of your personal data.
To file a request or take action on one of your rights, please contact us
at the contact details provided. You will not have to pay a fee to access
your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,
repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in
relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all
legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a
number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Data Retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil
the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying
any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the
appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount,
nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm
from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for
which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In
some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data (see “EU Data
Subjects Legal Rights”). In some circumstances we may anonymize your
personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information
indefinitely without further notice to you.
International Data Transfers
The personal data you provide to us is being transmitted to us and
processed in the United States and by our affiliates and their service
providers in jurisdictions where we or they operate. Your personal data
will be protected subject to this privacy policy and contracts that impose
data protections as required by the country where your data was collected.
By using our Services you consent to the transfer, processing, storage and
access of your personal data of your personal data in and/or outside of the
jurisdiction in which you reside. Courts and other authorities in these
jurisdictions may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your
personal data. If your personal data is collected in Europe, we will
transfer your personal data subject to suitable safeguards, including
standard contractual clauses where appropriate.

Act (COPPA). K&N Sites and services are not directed to children under
