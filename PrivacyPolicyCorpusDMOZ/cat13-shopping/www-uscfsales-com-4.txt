Terms of Use
US Chess Sales Terms and Conditions
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE!
All users of this site agree that access to and use of this site are subject to the following terms and conditions and other applicable law. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site.
Customer Service Policies
Shipping Methods / International Shipping
Orders to be shipped out of the 48 contiguous United States are sent by your choice of FedEx and US Postal Service Shipping Options.
Orders to be shipped Internationally will be shipped via USPS International, FedEx International Economy, FedEx International Priority or DHL Express Worldwide.  All applicable options will be presented when shipping is calculated.
Please be advised that we will only ship Internationally via trackable methods.  The shipping options provided to you on our site are the only ones at our disposal and that are applicable to your specific order.  These services are provided by either DHL, FedEx or the United States Postal Service. We are sorry, but we cannot honor requests to ship via any other carriers.
We WILL NOT ship via any method that is not trackable. This is necessary to meet the standard credit card requirement that all sellers must be able to provide PROOF OF DELIVERY on all shipments.
When shipping internationally, delays or additional fees assessed by your country's customs department are beyond our control. Our customers are strongly encouraged to research their country's importing rules and if any additional fees, such as GST, duties or VAT are applicable. These fees are not included in the shipping costs and are, regrettably, your responsibility.
We are required by U.S. Customs exporting regulations to declare the appropriate value on every international shipment.  There are no exceptions to this rule.
If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact your local Customs Office to determine if any such fees are applicable to your purchase. We have no access to that information and will not be able to assist you in this matter.
Sales Tax
Sales Tax is excluded for every state with the exception of residents in Alabama. Standard Rates Apply.
Purchases Remitted with Check or Money Order Payments
All purchases that are paid for with a check or money order may be subject to a 2-week holding period. This includes both checks and money orders. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Return Policy Please visit our Return Policy page to learn more.
Package Refusal / Undeliverable Packages
If you change your mind about a purchase while the package is in transit, please do not refuse the package. When a package is refused, FedEx will charge US Chess Sales both the full transportation costs to return the package to us and an additional refusal fee.
If you do change your mind about a purchase and refuse delivery of the package, you will be responsible for ALL transportation, delivery and related costs for the package to be returned to us. These fees will be deducted from the amount of your refund. It will be much cheaper for you if you just sign for the package and submit a request to return it to us directly
If you provide us with an incorrect or incomplete shipping address and the package is not able to be delivered, the carrier will charge US Chess Sales the full transportation costs to return the package to us, as well as additional fees.
If the package was not deliverable due to a mistake by the customer, those fees will be the financial responsibility of the customer. Should the customer request that the package be re-shipped, the customer must first pay the return shipping costs and fees, as well as additional shipping charges to have the package sent out again.
Item Arrived Damaged
US Chess Sales uses the finest packaging materials to protect its packages and adheres to the strictest packing guidelines to minimize the likelihood of your package being damaged in transit. We understand how frustrating it can be to receive an item that is damaged.
In the unlikely event that the item that you received is damaged, please rest assured that US Chess Sales is committed to providing the finest customer service and our professional staff will work quickly to resolve the situation at absolutely no cost to you.
You have one week (7 calendar days) from the date that the package is delivered to notify us that the product you received is damaged. If you find that an item has arrived damaged, please keep all of the packaging materials that your shipment came with (cardboard box, packing materials) and notify us immediately.
Depending on the item that arrived damage, FedEx may wish to perform an inspection on the damaged item and its original packaging to verify the extent of the damage and that the package was properly packed. FedEx has 5 (five) business days to decide whether they want to perform an inspection. If they do decide to perform an inspection, a FedEx representative will come to the delivery address and pick up the damaged item and all packaging materials. It is not very common that FedEx does perform such inspections, but it does happen.
If you have notified us within the time frame, we will replace the item at no cost to you. Please note that in the case of Chessmen, where each piece is hand carved and unique, we may require that you send us back the damaged piece first. This is to ensure that the grain/coloring/carving of the replacement piece is identical to the one you are replacing. This is done for your benefit and is the only way an ideal match can be guaranteed.
If you notify us after the time period has expired, we will not honor any damaged item claims. In this situation, you should check to see if the item comes with a Manufacturer’s Warranty and contact them directly regarding replacement.
Warranty Coverage
If an item is covered under a manufacturer's warranty and needs to be repaired or replaced, please contact the manufacturer directly to make repair arrangements. Product warranties are an agreement between the manufacturer of that product and you, the customer.
While US Chess Sales will be happy to provide assistance with warranty claims, such as furnishing contact information for the manufacturer, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine if your item qualifies for warranty coverage.
Processing Refunds
US Chess Sales will process your refund as soon as possible, but please allow up to 2 weeks to process your refund once it has been received.
We cannot be responsible for delays caused by the mail or by your credit card company.
US Chess Sales will refund you via the same method in which you paid - by credit card or by check. If you have not received your refund after 2 weeks, please contact us.
