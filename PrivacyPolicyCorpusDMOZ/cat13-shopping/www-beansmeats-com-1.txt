Customer Testimonials
"Just a shout out to you, we ordered a smoked turkey breast from you for Thanksgiving this year, first time ever eating smoked turkey.
It was DELICIOUS!!!! Just the right amount of smoke, if anyone is not a fan of smoked meat, they really should try this anyway, I think they would be surprised.
We will definitely being buying this again!"
Lisa Gilreath
"The best hotdogs on earth "Red Snappers" and the jarred mincemeat is as good as it gets Thank you for holding quality at its best."
Dan Moffett
"I ordered these over the summer when I got super homesick for Maine, and they were absolutely delicious. "
Tricia Blankenship
"I love Bean's and Rice's hot dogs. Sometimes they taste better than lobster!"
Gail Tuffley
"We got our Turkey from you guys. We always get our meat from Bean's and our Christmas ham but had never gotten a Turkey. This thing was the most delicious turkey we have ever made. Next year we will be serving a Bean's turkey again for sure."
