email to any email address containing "starcycle.com", or submit unsolicited
commercial communication through any contact forms on starcycle.com, voluntarily
enter a contract with Starcycle USA, Inc. and agree to be bound by the terms of

you understand and agree that neither Starcycle USA, Inc., it's employees, nor
anyone else with an email address including "starcycle.com" has ever requested
any commercial communication from you, and that any commercial message you send
through a contact form or that includes "starcycle.com" in the To, Cc, or Bcc
fields that fits these criteria is against the express wishes of the recipient(s).

containing the domain name "starcycle.com." Violation of this clause subjects
