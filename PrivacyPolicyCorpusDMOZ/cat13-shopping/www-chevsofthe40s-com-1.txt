Chevs of the 40's Standard Policies:
Item Availability
Most orders for In-Stock items begin the order process as soon as your online purchase is completed. Items in stock will be shipped once the item is located in stock, your payment is approved, and the receiving address is verified. We do not process payment for Out of Stock and Backordered items.
Most orders placed prior to 1:00pm PST ship the same day. After your order leaves our facility, delivery times vary according to the shipping method you select during checkout and the location of your shipping address. Please note that business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the United States.
Special Order Items
Special Order & Drop Ship items require additional time before they can be shipped. These items ship once item is ready, your payment is approved, and the receiving address is verified.
Shipping
We use UPS exclusively here at Chevs of the 40s.
Through years of shipping products every different way we have determined that this is the best possible service that we can offer.
It can mean higher shipping charges sometimes, but we feel that the pros out weigh the cons.
Overseas orders are
shipped via UPS Expedited only, unless Saver is the only option.
We have negotiated a 50% discount that we pass along to you to help ease the higher shipping fees associated with using this service.
This does guarantee that the product will get to you, but it also means that they will collect the duties and taxes for the shipment.
We have found that usually orders up to $100 on average cost the same as a $5 order, so please keep this in mind when placing your orders.
If you would like to know shipping fees ahead of time please email us separately and we will notify you of shipping costs prior to shipping.
Shipping Methods and Costs
Depending on the item(s) you purchase and the location to which the items will be delivered, different shipping methods will be available. Each shipping method has its own restrictions and charges that will be applied to your order.
At checkout, you will be prompted to choose a shipping method for your item(s). (Please note, some items may offer only one shipping method.) Shipping costs are dependent on the items in your order and the shipping method you select. Your total shipping charges will automatically compute during checkout prior to the completion of your order.

An order containing multiple items typically receives a volume-shipping discount and therefore your total shipping and handling cost may be lower than the sum of individual ship charges appearing in your cart. You will be provided with the total shipping cost for your order during Checkout. When ordering in bulk it is best to phone in your order. Large orders may require special handling or shipping calculations which may delay your order if we can not reach you to confirm the new shipping amount.
Generally, you will have the option of upgrading your shipping method for faster delivery (such as Third Day, or Overnight service). If you choose to upgrade your shipping method, your order must be received and clear credit authorization by 12:00 p.m. (noon) PST or your order may not be processed until the following business day.

Tracking Your Order
When can you track your order?
Orders placed may be delivered by one of several different carriers and shipping methods. Therefore, tracking availability may vary depending on the type of item you purchased, the shipping method you selected during Checkout, and the carrier that is delivering your item(s).
Expedited Special orders typically are shipped from the factory and package tracking may not be available. In these instances, Your Order History on-line will not offer tracking information, but will still offer order status and other related details. Read the information provided below on this page to learn the difference between tracking information and the order status.
To view tracking information Log In for Your Account 24 hours a day.
Finding Your Order Status
The status of your order is easy to find.
Check your e-mail. You were required to enter an e-mail address during Checkout; you will receive e-mails at your address keeping you up-to-date about the status of your order.
You may Log into our web site for Your Account 24 hours a day. You may view information about your most recent orders (including tracking information) as well as past orders (available after January 1, 2007)
Contact us. If you still have questions about your order, please contact us via e-mail or by phone.
How is order status different from tracking information?
The status of your order represents what is happening with your order between the time you place it and the time it ships from our facility. Once your order leaves, it is handled by a carrier (such as FedEx, USPS or UPS) that may provide tracking information until your order is delivered*. The tracking information is accessible by logging onto Your Account on our web site when the information becomes available.
*Tracking information may not be available for up to 48 hours after an item is shipped.
