We offer free ground shipping in the lower 48 states for most purchases over $75.00. In the case of some unusually large or heavy products, overweight charges may apply. In those cases, the product's description will clearly indicate such. Some products are required to be shipped freight at an additional cost to you when UPS or Fed Ex will not deliver. If you would like to upgrade from UPS ground shipping you can contact us for a quote. If you have special shipping needs or circumstances please contact us as we will do everything we can to ensure you receive your purchase in time and as expected.
We use United Parcel Service (UPS) for all shipping in continental US. We also offer US Postal Service & UPS
as an option for shipping to Alaska and Hawaii the free shipping over $75.00 doesn't apply, and use USPS exclusively for shipping to APO/FPO addresses. You'll get an instant shipping quote by simply entering your zip code on the shopping cart page.
Our products are shipped directly from our Portland, OR warehouse, or in some cases, directly from the manufacturer. The estimated time to shipping is shown on each product page and will sometimes depend on which product options are chosen. The estimated delivery date for your order is shown on the shopping cart page after you have entered your zip code or postal code. We try hard to get your order to you in the estimated time. Bonus items may ship separate from the cue. Bonus items are shipped UPS ground if the cue is shipped to you direct from a manufacturer.
Once your order is shipped, you will receive an email with the tracking number. You can also check the tracking number(s) on your account page by clicking on My Account.
Canadian Shipping
We use United Parcel Service (UPS) and USPS International Airmail Parcel Post for shipping to Canada.  To get a shipping quote, simply type your postal code into the form on the shopping cart page. You may also be required to pay import duty, local taxes, and brokerage fees. These will be collected at the time of delivery. Please check with your local authorities to determine the amount before ordering. We attach an invoice to the outside of the box with a detailed description of the products to reduce customs delays, but occasionally orders are still delayed in customs for up to several weeks.
International Shipping
We do not currently ship to locations outside the United States and Canada.
