If you forget your password, we will first verify your identity, then send your password to the email address specified in your Nutrabio.com account.
Why your transactions are secure: We use state-of-the-art encryption technology provided by Thawte to safeguard your transactions. The technology used is SSL (Secure Socket Layer) which is supported by both Netscape and Internet Explorer web browsers that are version 3.0 or newer. Your information, including your credit card information, is encrypted and cannot be read as it travels over the Internet.  We never display your full credit card information.

Your privacy is important: Your privacy is extremely important to us. For this reason, we'd like you to know about the personal information we collect and how that information is used.
