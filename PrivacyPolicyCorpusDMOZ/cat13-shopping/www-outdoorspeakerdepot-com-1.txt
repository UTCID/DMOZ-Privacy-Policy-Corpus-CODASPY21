Privacy Policy
We respect your privacy. Therefore we never share or sell your personal information with any third parties. Any information collected through this site is intended to be used for this transaction only. Your personal information is secured via SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Technology.
Outdoor Speaker Depot is committed to providing you with a high-quality shopping experience with respect for your security and privacy.
Secure Ordering
Orders placed at OutdoorSpeakerDepot.com are secure. Our dedicated servers are equipped with industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) data encryption technology that enables anyone using an SSL-compatible browser (such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari) to send and receive data from our server in encrypted form. When you click on "checkout," our server will automatically transfer you into a secure mode if supported by your browser. Most browsers give an indication that you have a secure connection by showing a closed lock in the URL window at the top of the browser window. In all cases, the displayed URL will show https instead of HTTP. If you get an error when you try to enter secure mode, it may be that you have an incompatible browser, or you are behind a firewall that does not support encrypted transmissions. You may need to contact your ISP or system administrator to resolve these problems. Please feel free to place your order 24/7 through our secure website or you can phone in your order by calling us at 888-779-4968 Mon - Fri 8:30 am to 5:30 pm Pacific Standard Time.
E-Mail
OutdoorSpeakerDepot.com does not share e-mail addresses with third parties. When you order online, you will receive confirmation e-mails and, in some cases, a follow-up e-mail asking you to rate your experience.
