Thank you for visiting the The Battery Doctor website.
Protecting customer privacy is very important to us. Our Online Privacy Statement is available to inform you about our collection and use of personal information so that you can make informed choices about how your own information is collected and used. This Online Privacy Statement reflects the The Battery Doctor policies covering personal information collected at this website on or after the effective date shown above.
We believe that information used responsibly benefits consumers and the economy.
The Battery Doctor strives to better serve our customers by offering goods and services that we believe fit their needs and interests.

Central to that commitment is ensuring that we abide by a set of privacy policies, which are outlined below. These policies guide us in the collection and use of information as well as employee responsibilities in protecting your privacy. We use personal information about consumers only in a manner consistent with these policies.
