Policies & Terms of Service
Delivery/Shipping Policies
At this time, we do not ship to P.O. Boxes. Our shipping is through reputable companies only. Larger items will be shipped via truck. Please allow 2-6 weeks for your items to arrive. Your entire order may not arrive at the same time due to back orders or different locations for storage of products, custom orders etc., but please be assured that you will receive it in its entirety by the estimated date. All custom work including signs, grapevine and custom lighting can take up to 6 weeks or more for delivery and will be shipped separately. Oak Lodge is not responsible for any additional charges such as duty or brokerage.  It is the customers responsibility to pay these upon receipt of an order.  However, we have gone to great lengths to list every product with delivery information for both Canadian customers and U.S., customers.  Oak Lodge will pay the insurance on all orders. This is a peace of mind gift for our customers, and our way of saying "Thank you".International Orders
We offer our products to Canada and the United States!  Because of cross border shipping, Oak Lodge is not responsible for any delays due to customs at the border. Customer service and satisfaction is our top priority, and we will endeavor to make any shipment to any location as smooth as possible.
Cancellation Policy
We will attempt to cancel any unshipped orders, provided you notify us within 24 hours of placing your order. A 10% charge will apply to your order to cover bank fees.
Pricing Policy
We reserve the right to correct pricing errors without notice.
Returns
At Oak Lodge, your satisfaction comes first. We will do everything in our power to ensure the quality of your product(s).  However, due to high shipping costs, we are unable to accept returned merchandise and all sales are final.
Damages and Return Policy
Oak Lodge only ships with reputable companies. Our products are inspected and packaged professionally before shipping out to our customers. Our shipping companies use the utmost care in handling all packages to ensure a safe arrival of your goods. If a situation may arise that your order arrives damaged, you must follow these guidelines.
Inspecting the condition of the package is required when you receive your order. Should your order arrive and the packaging is damaged, do not let the driver leave without written acknowledgment that the packaging arrived damaged.
Inspecting the contents of the package is required when you receive your order. If your order is damaged or faulty due to shipping, you are responsible to report the claim to Oak Lodge immediately.  If you need any assistance, Oak Lodge will be happy to help.  However, you must contact Oak Lodge within 24 hours at 1-800-Oak-Lodge or customerservice@oaklodge.ca of receiving your package(s) so we can assess the situation and give proper direction. Failure to comply with these guidelines will eliminate any assistance from Oak Lodge or shipping companies involved.
