are some that may require technical assistance in product selection.
For all assistance with product selection, information and ordering, please call
us at 1.800.667.8721
Prices:
We usually have the internet’s best pricing. Please call or email if you
see a better price – we can usually match or do better.
Back to Top
Ordering:
We accept orders from anywhere in the United States, as well as Eastern
Canada. However, any orders to areas outside the contiguous USA may be
subject to an additional shipping charge. Sometimes it is possible to
ship to a forwarding address within the US.  International orders cannot
be accepted. We also cannot accept returns from Canada.
Back to Top
Payment Methods:
We gladly accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express Cards,
as well as Business or Personal Checks, and Bank Checks. (All checks may be processed electronically). Please note that
payment by Personal checks may delay your order by up to
two weeks. Customers may also pay via PayPal.
Back to Top
Sales Tax:
Unless a current Resale Certificate is provided, Connecticut residents and
businesses will have 6.35% tax added.
Back to Top
Made-To-Order, Custom	& Special Orders:
Many of our products/services are unique and are manufactured specially
for you and are
not returnable.
A custom or special order may not be cancelled after three days. After
production has begun, changes to custom orders are usually not possible
and can only be made at the discretion of the manufacturer/artisan and
may incur additional charges. All products with ship times over three weeks
are Made-To-Order or Custom.
Back to Top
Minimum Orders:
KitchenSource.com
always tries to provide our customers with the best prices possible, but due
to the high cost of order processing, there is a minimum order value for
low priced items of $40. Orders under this value will incur a $10 fee.
To avoid this fee please order multiple quantities of the same item or
different items of the same brand to reach this minimum.  Minimum
Order items are not returnable.
Back to Top
Shipping:
To save time and unnecessary cost, all orders are shipped directly to you from our manufacturers’ or importers’ warehouses.  We are proud to save you money by offering free shipping on most products (Contiguous USA only). On some items there is a minimum shipping charge if the order value for a brand is under $99.
There are a few isolated areas of the US which require us to make special shipping arrangements. If you wish to have your order delivered to one of these unique locations, please contact our customer care team and they will be happy to assist you in obtaining a shipping quote.

Ground Service:
Most orders are shipped UPS or Fedex and most
will not require a signature upon delivery. If a signature is requested
please be sure to fully inspect the contents of your packages before signing for the
order, even if the packaging seems in good condition (see
Damages
below).
Back to Top
Freight Carrier (by Truck):
If your order ships by truck, a representative from the freight company
will contact you by phone to arrange the delivery, usually within a
specific four-hour time period. Please be aware that all freight (truck)
deliveries are to the curbside only and you will be required to provide
assistance to the driver to unload your shipment from the truck. Please
keep in mind the weight and size of your delivery as additional helpers
may be needed to unload and transport your packages. If you are unable
to provide assistance, it may be necessary for the driver to use a
tailgate lift at an extra charge. As with all
deliveries, please thoroughly inspect the contents of all packages for
damages before signing for the delivery. When signing for your package,
please write "'uninspected', possible damage" near your name when
signing for it so that we may help file a claim for you if there is
concealed damage. Otherwise, you would be required to file the claim (see
Damages below).
Back to Top
Ship Times:
Ship time is indicated for each product in the shopping cart area of the
product's page and is based on information supplied by the manufacturer
/ vendor and often represents "typical" turnaround time. For example: a
shipping time of "Within One Week" means that your order may leave the
factory/warehouse as soon as one day or up to a week after you place
your order.  Add shipping time of another few days to a week for arrival
depending on the warehouse location.
When you place an order
we advise you, in good faith, of expectations and we will let you know
if we are subsequently made aware of any unforeseen delay. However,
products, if available, may ship immediately or before the "typical
time" indicated. Unfortunately, since cost has been incurred, any item
that has already shipped cannot be cancelled and, if returned, will be
subject to a restock fee and shipping costs.
Ship times
for Made-to-Order, Custom, and Special Order items may vary
from our quoted time. Sometimes they will ship sooner and sometimes
later than expected.
To
check the status of your order, you can do so at
https://www.kitchensource.com/secure/account/
Back to Top
Damages:
Shipping damage is very rare but, unfortunately, it sometimes happens.
However, if procedures are followed we will be able to resolve issues
quickly and satisfactorily. It is of the utmost importance that any
damages are reported to us as soon as possible and not later than 10
days from receipt of packages (5 days for Virtu USA orders) because no damage claims will be accepted
by shipping companies after 10 days (5 days for Virtu USA orders) from date of delivery.  If you allow
this time to elapse no claims can be made; a return cannot be accepted
and we will be unable to provide a replacement or refund. If you intend
to store an item for later use you should unpack it and examine for
possible hidden damage. Please report any damage by email to
support@kitchensource.com or by phone at 1.800.667.8721 and
we will be ready to help.
If a product has been
damaged in transit, we will provide a replacement subject to our
ownership (as described below).
Most
orders will not require a signature upon delivery but if a signature is
requested please
be sure to fully inspect the contents of your packages before signing
for the order, even if the packaging seems in good condition. There may
be hidden damages to the contents. Be sure to advise your family members
or agent who may accept delivery on your behalf to do the same. If
you do not have time to inspect your order upon delivery, if the delivery person does not give you the opportunity to inspect the goods upon delivery, or if you suspect possible damage, write "Un-inspected, possible damage" above or near your signature.
Also, please be aware that, when you sign for a package, you are signing a document transferring ownership to you; that states you have inspected the shipment and that it is in good condition. As such, if any of the above conditions apply, please be sure to include
"Un-inspected, possible damage" above or near your signature so that we can assist in a speedy resolution.
Damage claims with
Freight Carriers may only be made by the owner. So, if you do sign for a
package and later realize it has been damaged in the shipping process,
as the owner, you will need to file a claim with the freight company
yourself and KitchenSource.com will be unable to help.  However, we
can help file a claim if signed with "Un-inspected, possible
damage" as described above.
We can always help with
such claims from UPS or Fedex Ground as they operate with different
rules.
Back to Top
Defects:
Must be reported within 10 days (5 days for Virtu USA orders) of delivery. If you intend to store an
item for later use you should unpack it and examine for possible
defects. Please report any defect by email to
support@kitchensource.com or by phone at 1.800.667.8721
Back to Top
Returns:
Our intention here at KitchenSource.com is that you receive
goods exactly as described but, if you do need to make a return; our
intention is to make it hassle free. If the product you have received is
defective, we will gladly ship you another at our expense. If the
product has been damaged in transit, we will provide a replacement
subject to our “Damages” terms above. For both
defective and damaged products, claims must be reported to us within 10
days of delivery (5 days for Virtu USA orders). Any claims made after this 10 day period (5 days for Virtu USA orders) can not be
accepted and returns must be complete within 30 days.
Returns for other reasons must be made within 30 days, freight paid, and
with an appropriate RAN. The goods must be in the
original packaging complete with all original contents, including manuals
and warranty cards; and be in re-saleable condition. Credits are less the
original shipping charges incurred for the original shipments.
There is no restocking fee if an order is placed for an exchange or replacement of equal or greater value. Otherwise, you may choose a Store Credit, less any shipping fees for use at any of our online stores; or a refund less a 15% deduction and less the initial shipping charges incurred.
Returns must be sent to the address specified in the RAN.
Regrettably, our address in Milford is offices only so returns cannot
be accepted. Any items returned to KitchenSource.com without
express approval cannot be accepted and will be refused.
Unfortunately we cannot accept returns from Canada, on Minimum Order
items, Custom and most Made-to-Order items.Items which have been installed or assembled, or that have been modified or altered in any way, are not returnable.
RAN
A Return Authorization Number MUST be obtained from us
before returning any item. Return goods must be shipped to the
appropriate manufacturer's or distributor's warehouse. Goods returned to
our office address without approval will not be accepted and will be
returned to you.
Back to Top
Cancellations:
You may cancel any order (except Made-To-Order or custom orders) without charge or penalty as long as the order
has not already shipped. Unfortunately, since cost has been incurred,
any item that has already been shipped cannot be cancelled and, if
returned, will be subject to a restock fee and shipping costs. Because
of costs incurred, Custom, Special Order and Made-To-Order goods may not
be cancelled after three days.

Product Image Disclaimer:
KitchenSource.com tries to provide the most accurate images
available. However, due to the variances in computer monitors and
the various settings to brightness and contrast that users may
adjust their monitors to, we cannot guarantee with any certainty
that the color represented in a product image on your monitor is
exactly as it appears in the physical world.
Back to Top
Errors and Omissions:
While we do our very best to insure that the pricing and product
information on our website is accurate, occasionally typographical
and informational errors do appear. We apologize for any
inconsistency, but reserve the right not to fulfill orders based on
incorrect pricing or information.
Back to Top
Privacy:
KitchenSource.com will never disclose your name or any other
private details to anyone else unless directly related to the
fulfillment of your order. We will occasionally send you newsletters
via email to inform you of new products or special offers. At your
request, we will remove you from our mailing list at any time.
