About DNA Sample Collection
How will I collect my DNA?
It's simple. Just follow our step-by-step directions for taking an effortless, painless sample of cheek cells using a special swab from your mouth. You'll find straightforward instructions in the collection kit we send out the day you place your
order. Learn more about the process.
Do you accept only cheek cells in the collection process?
Cheek cells are the most common source of DNA samples because they're easiest to collect. However, we are able to process your DNA from a hair sample for an additional cost. Please contact us
for additional information.
Is each piece truly unique to every individual?
Absolutely. The technique we employ would result in a unique genetic image for every individual in the world! No two pieces of art can ever be the same. We think that's the beauty of DNA portraiture.
How do you ensure my security and privacy?
At DNA 11, privacy and security are critical priorities. We use a secure lab facility to process your DNA sample, and a coded six-digit tracking number, not names, to identify samples. Our
privacy policy should reassure you, but please contact us directly with any specific concerns.
How do I know that my artwork was made from my DNA only?
As you might expect, we take great pride in ensuring the authenticity of every DNA portrait we create. We use fail-safe methods to track every sample we receive, and have strict processes for verifying that the secure tracking code on your
artwork does indeed match your identity. In fact, we're so proud of our system we invited major media outlets including Discovery Channel and HGTV to tour our facilities.
Are the art pieces signed?
We don't sign the front of the artwork, because you are in fact the true artist. As such, we provide an option for you to add your signature to your art.
What genetic information can be retrieved from my artwork?
None. We do this on purpose to add an additional layer of security to your art piece. The standard procedure we use creates a unique, artistic representation of your genetic code, but it does not hold any specific information about your genetic makeup. There is no way that anyone can read the portrait to deduce anything specific about your
DNA.
Do you keep my DNA?
No. Every sample is discarded in our secure lab facility immediately after an image is successfully captured. The destruction of your sample is a mandatory step in a highly secure process.
Learn more about our privacy guarantee.
Do you store my image?
Your biological DNA sample is destroyed immediately after it is captured as a digital image. This digital image is stored but only for six months, and then it is permanently deleted. Should you wish for us to delete it sooner, just get in touch
with us and we'll be happy to carry out your wishes. Storing an electronic image of your raw DNA Portrait can save you sampling and set-up costs should you decide to place a future order. Remember that the procedure we use creates a unique image,
but does not store any information whatsoever about your genetic code. Scan our privacy and security policy for more information.
DNA Portrait FAQs
Can I choose the color and size of my art piece?
Yes. We have many options to allow you to express your personality while you match your décor! We have 25 unique color options. Be creative. All the choices are visible in our online store. If you would like a custom color created we can match
any pantone color or paint code for you for an additional fee. Contact us for more details.
What materials do you use to create the art piece?
Each piece is a Giclée fine art piece, printed on high-quality, acid-free, polyester-cotton canvas, using pigmented inks designed to resist fading. Each piece is also sealed with a non-yellowing protective varnish to further prolong the print
life.
Can you make a DNA Portrait of deceased person?
Yes. It's a common request. Many people take great comfort in having a DNA Portrait of a departed loved one. Working with about ten inches total of individual hair strands, we can capture a precise DNA image through a process called mitochondrial
DNA extraction. Please contact us for more information.
Can I make a DNA Portrait of my favorite pet?
Effortlessly. A DNA Portrait of your companion is a beautiful way to celebrate the spirit of your friend. The process, like that for your human companions, is easy and painless (just a quick swab from the mouth). And the result is spectacular.
The swab collects cheek cells so is best used on mammals such as dogs, cats and horses.

collection kit and everything else your friend will need to get started. You do not need to select a color before ordering. You can wrap the presentation box as the symbol of your gift. Surprise!
