This information is used only for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you. All information regarding your Danforth Pewter order is kept confidential.
Site Statistics
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We collect statistics about our sales, traffic patterns, and related site information. The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor's browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. You may opt-out of this practice by visiting Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs page.

When you use your credit card to shop at danforthpewter.com, rest assured that the transaction is secure. Our servers use Secure Socket Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology. This technology safeguards your personal information and guarantees privacy.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) have access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.
