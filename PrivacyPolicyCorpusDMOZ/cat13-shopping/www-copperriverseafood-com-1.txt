The data we collect is information that identifies you personally, such as: name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone numbers, website URLs, credit card information and other billing information.

So What Are Cookies?
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased.

Session ID cookies may be used by COPPER RIVER SEAFOODS, INC. to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by COPPER RIVER SEAFOODS, INC. to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site
Log Files
Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. None of the information stored in the log files is linked to personally identifiable information.

COPPER RIVER SEAFOODS, INC. will not in any way share this information with a third party either for free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorize such disclosures.
You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. No information will be collected or provided to third parties without your prior knowledge.

We use various credit card processing companies to bill you for our products and services.
