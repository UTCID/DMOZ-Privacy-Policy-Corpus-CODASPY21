Great Service
I search and evaluate product offerings and availability extensively before I buy. Hooks & Lattice offers a good variety. When I placed my order, it was acknowledged promptly and I received an e-mail notice telling me when it was shipped. It arrived at my house quickly and just in time for installation as part of a weekend project. I am very pleased with the company and the products I purchased.
