Frequently Asked Questions
How are shipping costs determined?
Because many of our food items are frozen, we take special care to deliver your items quickly without impacting quality so this requires expedited shipping. If your order does not include frozen cuisine then expedited shipping charges will not be included and your order will be sent via standard shipping. You will have the opportunity to review your order and the shipping costs before placing your order.
Should you wish to avoid expedited shipping costs on orders including frozen cuisine, please visit our center locator page for a center nearest you. At a center you can have your consultations in person and pick up your food during your meeting.

How can I track my order?
Once your order is processed and your credit card payment is received, we will ship your order. You will receive an email confirmation with your order number and a link to track your order. You can also visit your profile to view past and current orders. Click on the order number to view order details and shipping status. If your order has shipped, you can view the tracking number.

What if I am not home when my order is delivered?
In most cases, the shipper will leave the package at your door if you are not home. Some shippers will leave a package with a neighbor or will provide a delivery slip with pick-up location information. Policies vary by state and shipper. If you do not receive your package as scheduled, you can track your package from your shipping confirmation email, or through the shipper. Make sure you will be able to access your frozen food shipment the day it is received and place frozen items into your freezer as soon as possible.
You can also contact Customer Service at 1-800-JennyCare (536-6922).
