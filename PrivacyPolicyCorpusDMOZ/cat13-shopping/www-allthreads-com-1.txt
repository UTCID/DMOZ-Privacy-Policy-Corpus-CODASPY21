Your Privacy & Security
Is it safe to place an online order with All Threads?
You bet it is!
All Threads utilizes SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), an advanced technology which encrypts
the data you enter during the checkout process, prior to sending it to our web server.
As an added security measure, your order confirmation e-mail and printed invoice
will reference only the last 4 digits of your credit card number.
What about my privacy?
We value your privacy every bit as much as we value our own. As such, we promise
that the personal information you give us will remain private. We will never
disclose your personal information or e-mail address to any third party, except
as necessary to complete your order.
All Threads may, from time to time, e-mail you about new products, sales or other
special offers on our web site that we think you'd be interested in. If you'd prefer
not to receive those e-mails, just let us know! Send an e-mail with your request
to privacy@allthreads.com -
we'll promptly remove you from our mailing list.
