RMA Return / Exchange Form
To return or exchange any products from your order, please visit our online return and exchange form to generate and print your RMA documents.
Sale and Closeout Products
Closeout products are parts that are no longer part of our regular inventory. These products have had their price reduced so we can get them all out of our warehouse and clear our shelves for new parts. There are no refunds on these products, but defective items may be be returned for store credit only. Buy at your own risk.
Sale products are parts that we stock as part of our regular inventory, but have had their price reduced temporarily for a promotion. We sometimes run weekend-long themed sales on specific product types (example: 10% off Red parts). These are an example of sale products, and the discount only applies to orders placed through our webstore. Because sale products are part of our regular inventory, the general return policy applies to them and returns and refunds are accepted as with any other regular item.
Special Orders
Special orders of products direct from the manufacturer require a non-refundable 50% deposit. The customer is responsible for researching and supplying the exact manufacturer product code / part number to Allparts. Shipping for these products follows our standard pricing structure available at www.allparts.com/shipping. Special order products cannot be returned or exchanged except in the case of defect.
