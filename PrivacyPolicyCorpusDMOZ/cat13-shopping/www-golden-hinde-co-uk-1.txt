Client Reviews
Since I discovered your store in 2015 I have bought three chatelaine scissors:  Celtic, Jasmine and Scroll.  They are lovely! Here in Spain they are impossible to find, so I am very grateful to Golden Hinde for sending me so fast and timely.
I have kept for myself the Jasmine and Scroll chatelaines and the Celtic is for a very special present for my sister-in-law, and they are going to Paris!Beatrice - from SpainGolden Hinde CustomerYou really have everything i need, as you advertised - One Stop Shopping!Golden Hinde Customer I met you both at the Harrogate knitting and stitching show, you were both extremely helpful. I was amazed by the extensive array of beautiful sewing threads which was a sight to behold, not to mention all the other sewing accoutrements. I thoroughly enjoyed spending more than I intended to, and I get so much joy from using everything I bought from you. Thank you.Emily PreciousGolden Hinde CustomerA lovely helpful and friendly group of people. Wish I lived closer to them so I could attend their workshops. I met them at the Harrogate Knitting and Stitching show yesterday and had a lovely chat with them. Their display is lovely.Maureen BromleyGolden Hinde CustomerGolden Hinde classes are so pleasant and enjoyable. Sarah is very patient and such a happy person she is infectious. I look forward to going to Warrington all the time.
Her wires and materials are so inspirational, you want to do everything all at once. I feel like child in a sweet shop full of goodies.VeronicaAttended class taught by Golden Hinde
