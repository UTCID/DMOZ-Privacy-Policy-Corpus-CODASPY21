for our own internal purposes, such as providing,
maintaining, evaluating, and improving the
CafePress.com Services and the Web Site, fulfilling
requests for information, producing and shipping
the products that you order, and providing
customer support. For example, if you create

Does
CafePress.com Disclose My Information to Third
Parties?
Generally
speaking, we do not intentionally disclose
your information to third parties without
your consent. However we reserve the right
to do so because it is necessary to the operation
and continued growth of our business or to
protect the rights of others. These instances
are discussed below:
Disclosure
to Successors. We may disclose
your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest
of ours, such as a company that acquires us.
In the event CafePress.com goes through a
business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
by another company, or sale of all or a portion
of its assets, your personally identifiable
information will likely be among the assets
transferred. You will be notified via email
or by a notice on our Web Site of any such
change in ownership or control of your personal
information.
Disclosure
to Unaffiliated Third Parties. We
may disclose your Personal Information to
prevent an emergency, to protect or enforce
our rights, to protect or enforce the rights
of a third party, or as required or permitted
by law (including, without limitation, to
comply with a subpoena or court order). In
particular, if you are a Shopkeeper, we may
disclose your information to a third party
that alleges that you have infringed their
intellectual property rights through the products
sold through your Shop. Similarly, if you
allege that a Shopkeeper allegedly infringes
your intellectual property rights, we may
disclose your information to that Shopkeeper.
Disclosure
to Third-Party Service Providers.
We may contract with
various third parties who help us provide
and maintain the Web Site or the CafePress.com
Services. For example, we use a third-party
to process payments made to us, and may subcontract
out production, fulfillment, or other operations.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts
to prevent such third parties from disclosing
your Personal Information, except for the
purpose of providing the services in question.
We cannot guarantee that such third parties
will not disclose your Personal Information.
Disclosure
to Shopkeepers. If
you purchase a product from a Shop, CafePress.com
may provide your name, and the city and state
information provided by you to the Shopkeeper.
In the Shopkeeper Agreement, CafePress.com
contractually obligates each Shopkeeper not
to use or disclose this information for any
purposes other than internal record keeping,
and for marketing their Shops, only if you
have opted in to receive marketing material
directly from the Shopkeeper. We cannot guarantee
all Shopkeepers will comply with this obligation.
Disclosure
of Non-Personal Information.
We will disclose Non-Personal Information,
in aggregate form, to potential strategic
partners, advertisers, investors, customers,
and others. You may not "opt out"
of the sharing of this information. However,
it cannot be easily used to identify you personally.
What
About Cookies?

from a web server and stored on your computer's
hard drive. Most web sites use cookies. We
use cookies to track your use of the Web Site

Policy covers the use of cookies by CafePress.com
only and does not cover the use of cookies
by any advertisers.
Does
CafePress.com Protect My Personal Information?
Personal
Information. Whenever we obtain your Personal
Information, we use commercially reasonable
efforts to protect it from unauthorized access
or disclosure. However, we are not insurers
of the security of your Personal Information.
Accordingly, we assume no liability for any
disclosure of data due to errors in transmission,
unauthorized third party access or other acts
of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond
our reasonable control.
Web
Site Content. The content that you store,
post, or transmit on or through the Web Site,
such as message board postings, "About
Me" pages, and images on your Products,
may be accessed by other users, including
people that you do not know. We are not responsible

be kept private.
Can
I Review and Make Changes to My Personal Information?
You
can obtain a copy of and request that we correct
errors in your Personal Information by emailing
us at privacy@cafepress.com. For your protection,
you will be required to provide proof of your
identity to obtain a copy of your Personal

terminate your account you can also contact
Customer Service.
Tell-A-Friend
If
you choose to use our referral service to
tell a friend about the CafePress.com Web
Site, we will ask you for your friend's name
and email address. We will automatically send
your friend a one-time email inviting him
or her to visit the Web Site. We store this
information for the sole purpose of sending
this one-time email and tracking the success
of our referral program. Your friend may contact
our Customer Service department to request
that we deactivate this information in our
database.
Security
The
security of your personal information is important
to us. When you enter sensitive information
such as a credit card number and/or social
security number on our registration or order
forms, we encrypt that information using secure
socket layer technology (SSL).
We
follow generally accepted industry standards
to protect the Personal Information submitted
to us, both during transmission and once we
receive it. However, no method of transmission
over the Internet, or method of electronic
storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while
we strive to use commercially acceptable means
to protect your personal information, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.
Does
This Policy Apply When I Access Third Party
Web Sites?
You
may be able to access third-party web sites
directly from the Web Site. This Privacy Policy
does not apply when you access such web sites.
We cannot control how third parties may use
Personal Information you disclose to them,
so you should carefully review the privacy
policy of any third-party web site you visit
before using it or disclosing your Personal
Information to its provider.
