Smart Credit Report®
This is a revolutionary new type of Credit Report and is not to be confused with a traditional credit report. What makes it so different is the way information is shown to you and how you can interact with your creditors by using action buttons. It also has a zoom feature to see more credit details and even your daily transactions that ultimately compromise of the information reported by a credit reporting agency.
Scores and ScoreTracker
Each of your Scores has a number ranging from bad to excellent along with a letter grade and how you compare to others. You also get a detailed overview of your Scores. All Scores are estimates and are for educational purposes only. They cannot be used to determine final credit.
Credit Score:
This is your credit score and its number range is 300-bad to 850-excellent. This score is a general representation of your credit risk lenders use to grant credit.
Auto Score:
This represents your possible risk to lenders if you purchase or lease a vehicle.
Insurance Score:
This represents your possible risk to an insurance company if they are underwriting your insurance.
Hiring Risk Index:
Many employers are allowed to view your credit report (not your credit score), when determining hiring or promotion. This Hiring Risk Index can help you better understand how employers may interrupt your credit report.
ScoreBuilder™
ScoreBuilder™ is a 120 day program to better understand what is helping or hurting your credit score and view possible actions you can take on your own.
ScoreBuilder™ Disclaimer: ScoreBuilder™ does not recommend, advise or guarantee any action or any result.

This is not credit repair and no action is ever sent to any Credit Reporting Agency; and therefore, not subject to regulation under a Federal or State Credit Repair Organization Act.
ScoreMaster®
ScoreMaster® is a simulator that helps you plan your future credit score and know when it's best to apply for credit.
By using ScoreMaster® you can see how making payments can increase your credit score and by when.

ScoreMaster® is also a great educational tool to better understand how your credit score works.

Alerts
This monitors information that is posted to a credit reporting agency (specifically TransUnion) or financial accounts once you add them to Money Manager.
Some monitoring Alerts you may get are more important and urgent than others.
For these important Alerts we recommend you activate Alerts on your
phone.
This will put an action button in your Alert to help you remove identity theft right from your phone without the need to log in to your account.
In addition, you will get various Alerts keeping you informed of the latest concerning your Money, Credit and Identity. The Alerts are simple and well organized for you. They include Alerts about your Membership, credit monitoring, identity theft alerts, creditor responses to your Actions and when payments are due on your Money Manager linked accounts.

you log in to your account you will see what percentage of Alerts you
have activated.
You will get 25% each for
activating your credit monitoring, Money Manager alerts and membership alerts totaling 75%.
This is an automatic function of our product and
there is nothing you need to do.
Lastly, you get 25% for activating Alerts on your phone.

IMPORTANT CONSUMER NOTICES
Please read the following important consumer notices carefully.
WE ARE REQUIRED BY CERTAIN LAWS TO DISCLOSE THE FOLLOWING: "ONLY THE CREDIT BUREAUS CAN REMOVE OR CORRECT INACCURATE, UNVERIFIABLE, OR OUTDATED INFORMATION, FROM YOUR CREDIT REPORT(S), WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CLAIMED TO BE ACCURATE BY THE CREDITOR WHO SUBMITTED THE INFORMATION TO THE CREDIT BUREAUS. YOU MAY SEEK TO HAVE ANY INACCURATE INFORMATION CORRECTED AND, IF APPROPRIATE, REMOVED BY THE CREDIT BUREAUS TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, INCLUDING THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE THAT NO ONE (INCLUDING US, OUR PRODUCTS, OR ANY CREDIT REPAIR/CARE SERVICE) CAN REMOVE ACCURATE AND CURRENT INFORMATION FROM YOUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROFILE."
The Federal Trade Commission and some States' Attorneys General regulate creditors, credit bureaus and credit care organizations. As a safe harbor statement please know: "You have the right to sue a credit services organization if it misleads you."
CONSUMER CREDIT FILE RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW
You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit file from a consumer credit reporting agency. They may charge a reasonable fee not to exceed eleven dollars ($11). There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information on your credit report within the preceding 60 days. There is also no fee if you certify that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment during the next sixty (60) days, that you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or that you have reason to believe that your file at such credit reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud. You also have the right to receive one free copy of your credit report from each consumer credit reporting agency per year at the www.annualcreditreport.com web site.
The credit data provided or requested through our product is not intended to constitute the disclosure of information by a credit reporting agency as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar laws.
In addition, if you reside in the state of Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or Vermont, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report once a year and if you reside in the state of Georgia, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report twice a year. Otherwise, a consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for providing you with a copy of your credit report.
You have a right to dispute inaccurate information by contacting the consumer credit reporting agency directly. However, neither you nor any company or credit services organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. Under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the consumer credit reporting agency and/or the reporting creditor must remove accurate negative information from your report only if it is over seven years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.
YOU UNDERSTAND ANY ACTIONS YOU MAY TAKE DO NOT GO TO ANY CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY/CREDIT BUREAU, BUT ONLY TO YOUR CREDITOR AS YOU SELECT AND INSTRUCT. IT IS YOUR CREDITOR'S SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION TO RESPOND TO YOUR ACTION AS THEY DEEM NECESSARY. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PURCHASE YOUR CREDIT REPORT FROM US TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR CREDITORS. YOU MAY COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH YOUR CREDITORS FOR ANYTHING YOU WISH AT ANY TIME.
If, separately from using our product, you have notified a credit reporting agency in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file, the consumer reporting agency must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate information. The consumer credit reporting agency may not charge a fee for this product. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the consumer credit reporting agency. If reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the consumer credit reporting agency, to keep in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The consumer credit reporting agency must include your statement about disputed information in any report it issues about you.
Nonprofit credit counseling services are available, usually without fees, to counsel you as to credit management and/or consolidation. Additionally, many of our product features you may perform on your own, such as our Actions. We are simply a neutral technology allowing consumers to communicate with their Creditors for whatever they need.

By using the Money Manager Service, you authorize Our System to access third party sites designated by you, on your behalf, to retrieve information requested by you. You hereby authorize and permit Our System to use information submitted by you to the Money Manager Service (such as account passwords and usernames) to accomplish the foregoing and to configure the Money Manager Service so that it is compatible with the third party sites for which you submit your information. For all purposes hereof, you hereby grant Our System a limited power of attorney, and you hereby appoint Our System as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, for you and in your name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to access third party sites, retrieve information, and use your information, all as described above, with the full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with such activities, as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could do in person. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN OUR SYSTEM IS ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SITES, OUR SYSTEM IS ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT THE AGENT OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY. You agree that Our System's third party account providers shall be entitled to rely on the foregoing authorization, agency and power of attorney granted by you.
Except for those relationships, you understand that Our System has no relationship to, affiliation, or connection with any third party sites available for use with the Money Manager Service. The Money Manager Service is not endorsed or sponsored by any such account providers. You agree that Our System assumes no responsibility and shall incur no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, or determinations of any such third party site. You acknowledge and agree that Our System may not maintain the same level of security against unauthorized access to your account information as the third party sites from which you authorize Our System to retrieve information on your behalf.
C. Categorization of Transactions, Accounts or Other Information.
The categorization in the Money Manager Service is an estimated categorization provided for your information only, and does not indicate accurate status of any transaction, account or other information. You agree that you will not rely on the categories provided in Money Manager or set by you for any purpose, including without limitation, for tax deductions.
The term Our System may mean the use of a service such as a provider of data in order to provide you with our product. Certain information in this section is copyright and used with permission from a third-party service.
6.4. Using our action buttons
Our product gives you action buttons, so you can easily communicate requests directly to your creditors. These Actions are no different than if you contacted your creditor directly by telephone or in writing. You are under no obligation to use our action buttons.
You understand and agree that you control all Actions that you take during your Membership. You understand and agree that Action results or delivery are not guaranteed. Your creditors and other third parties that you initiate Actions with will make all decisions regarding whether to respond to and/or agree to your requests. You fully understand that you use our products at your own risk. We are never responsible for any costs or other damages you may incur as a result of any Actions you make while using our product. Please see the important disclaimers and limitations of liability below. When you take an Action, you certify that all Actions initiated by you are appropriate and lawful. In particular, you understand and agree that disputing any valid accounts/charges or inappropriately claiming identity theft may constitute fraud, which is a crime subject to possible fines and/or imprisonment. If we determine that you are using our product to commit fraud, we will immediately terminate your account and we may report your activity to an appropriate law enforcement authority.
In order to process your Actions, we collect your financial account and creditor information. We may be required to collect additional identifying information or to verify your information by using third party sources. You agree to provide any additional information that we require in connection with your Actions. You are also granting us your limited power of attorney, located in the section entitled "Grant of Limited Power of Attorney", in order to delivery your Action request to your creditor.
You agree that if you add a creditor of your own through our Custom Action feature you are solely responsible for this information. You also agree that you will not add any credit reporting agency as a creditor and that any credit report disputes to any credit reporting agency from our system is strictly prohibited.
We reserve the right (but shall not be obligated) to filter your Action requests through our validation and frivolous filter engines designed to avoid abuses, provide continuity and protect our communications to the source or furnisher of information (i.e. your creditor) that is the subject of your Action.
Actions do not accumulate or roll-over to a subsequent billing period. If you choose not to use your free Action allotment granted to you per each billing period of your Membership, they will no longer be available to you. There are restrictions to the number of free Actions your Membership plan provides, please see Membership Options & Pricing above.
7. Grant of Limited Power of Attorney.
You, the Member, hereby grant ScoreMaster, its employees, agents, subcontractors and assigns, a specific, limited power of attorney, granting such authority necessary to provide our stated products to you, and to use the information contained in your personal credit profile and/or other creditor/sources of information to acquire your credit data, including, but not limited to, credit reports, scores, identification products, monthly credit report monitoring products and profiles so that we may provide current and future products to you.
You further grant to ScoreMaster full power and authority to submit every act initiated by you in the exercise of any of the powers granted hereunder as fully as you might or would authorize if you were personally present, with full power of substitution and revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all such acts undertaken within the authority of this power of attorney that are lawfully done or caused to be done.
ScoreMaster, in its professional judgment, shall have sole discretion in determining the specific acts necessary to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement and may also include written and oral communications on your behalf with various agencies and entities such as, but not limited to, sources of reporting, creditors and collection agencies sharing credit information relating to you, the Member, so we can acquire your credit information for your use.

Arbitration and legal remedies
THIS SECTION IS AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF OUR PRODUCTS. DO NOT ENROLL IN MEMBERSHIP OR OTHERWISE USE OUR PRODUCTS IN ANY WAY IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO OTHER LEGAL REMEDY, EXCEPT SMALL CLAIMS COURT, SHOULD YOU HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST US. THIS MEANS YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE "ALL" DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS INTENDED TO BE BROADLY INTERPRETED. IT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a Member of a certified class; and
claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
References to member.scoremaster.com, ScoreMaster and us includes subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Trade Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and ScoreMaster/scoremaster.com are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action forever. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
In the event we are found liable for any cost or damage suffered by you, the liability of ScoreMaster and its employees and agents shall be limited to the Membership and/or Action fees associated with the particular Action in question. The remedies set forth in this paragraph and termination of this Agreement as specified above are your exclusive remedies for claims or damages arising out of or relating in any way to this agreement or the products provided hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, our liability for any claim of any kind relating to this agreement or the products provided hereunder shall not exceed the amount paid by you to us for our products during the preceding twelve (12) months.
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NO CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY MAY BE CONSOLIDATED WITH A DISPUTE OF ANY OTHER PERSON IN ARBITRATION, OR RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS BY A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY SUCH COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Unless a different procedure is required by applicable law, the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
A demand for arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement may be made either before or after a lawsuit or other legal proceeding begins. However, any demand for arbitration that is made after a lawsuit or other legal proceeding has begun must be made within 90 days following the service of a complaint, third-party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.
You understand and agree that before you take a dispute to arbitration under this Agreement, you must first contact our customer account representatives and give us an opportunity to resolve this dispute. Information about the arbitration process and the AAA's arbitration rules and its fees are available from the AAA on the Internet at http://www.adr.org.
The cost of any arbitration proceeding shall be split between You and Us. You will pay one half of the filing fee, or $125.00, whichever is less, when the demand for arbitration is made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you believe the cost of arbitration may be too burdensome, you may seek a waiver of the filing fee under the applicable arbitration rules. If you seek, but not qualify for such waiver, we will consider a written request from you to advance all or part of the filing fee.
The arbitration will be based only on the written submissions of the parties and the documents submitted to the AAA relating to the dispute, unless either party requests that the arbitration be conducted using the AAA's telephonic, online, or in-person procedures (additional charges may apply for these procedures).
BECAUSE YOUR PURCHASE AND USE OF OUR PRODUCT REQUIRES THAT YOU CONSENT TO ARBITRATION OF YOUR CLAIMS OR DISPUTES, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTIVE PROCEEDING, EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF THAT PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
