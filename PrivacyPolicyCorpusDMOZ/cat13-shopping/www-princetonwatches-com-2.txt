Effective January 12, 2019
These Terms of Use apply to Princeton Watches (“Princeton”), inclusive of its:  website ("princetonwatches.com"), mobile and other applications, mobile services, telephone ordering and interactive voice response services, email address and accounts, and other websites and services where these Princeton Terms of Use are posted (collectively, the “Services”).
BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE—WHICH INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT—AND CONFIRM YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES.
ORDERS, RISK OF LOSS, AND RETURNS. Princeton accepts orders from the 50 United States (inclusive of domestic military bases), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands only. Princeton likewise ships products to the 50 United States (inclusive of domestic military bases), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands only. Princeton will add shipping and handling fees and applicable sales/use tax. Princeton reserves the right without prior notice to discontinue or change specifications and prices on products, services and other offerings (collectively, "Merchandise") offered through the Princeton Services. Merchandise displayed through the Princeton Services is available while supplies last. Descriptions of, or references to, Merchandise through the Princeton Services do not imply endorsement of that Merchandise, or constitute a warranty, by Princeton. All purchases are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for Merchandise purchased pass to you upon delivery of the Merchandise to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return or in advance of receiving returned Merchandise. In this situation, Princeton never takes title to the refunded Merchandise. Learn more about returning Merchandise at princetonwatches.com.
CORRECTION OF ERRORS AND INACCURACIES. The information provided through the Princeton Services may contain typographical errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Princeton reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). Please note that such errors, inaccuracies or omissions may relate to Merchandise description, pricing and availability. Princeton reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order, or any portion thereof, even after your receipt of an order confirmation from Princeton. Princeton reserves the right to limit the order quantity on any Merchandise. In the event that Merchandise is listed at an incorrect price due to supplier pricing information or typographical error, Princeton shall have the right to refuse or cancel orders placed for the Merchandise listed at the incorrect price, regardless of whether the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If the incorrect price or typographical error is discovered after the Merchandise has shipped, you acknowledge that you will either refuse the delivery, return the Merchandise (at Princeton's expense). If you refuse these options, you will be charged the Princeton price of the Merchandise as it should have been for the Merchandise in question on the day of the sale, or you may have restrictions placed on your Princeton account. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, Princeton shall promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.

The text, images, photographs, graphics, logos, illustrations, descriptions, data, information, and other material provided through the Princeton Services, as well as the selection, assembly and arrangement thereof, are referred to collectively as the "Content."

DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION AS TO USE OF THE PRINCETON SERVICES. THE PRINCETON SERVICES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PRINCETONWATCHES.COM) ARE OPERATED ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PRINCETON AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRINCETON SERVICES AND THE CONTENT, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, PRINCETON AND ITS AFFILIATES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE PRINCETON SERVICES WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ERROR. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL PRINCETON OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRINCETON SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF DAMAGES. YOUR USE OF THE PRINCETON SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING THE LAW IN NEW JERSEY, MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS TO MERCHANDISE. If for any reason you are not entirely pleased with Merchandise you purchased from Princeton using the Princeton Services, simply return the Merchandise consistent with our return policy, posted at princetonwatches.com. If not returnable under our return policy, all returns, replacements, service, and support must be handled directly between you and the manufacturer. Many items of Merchandise are packaged with the manufacturer's warranty (if any) and service information detailing specific terms and conditions. Learn more about returning Merchandise on princetonwatches.com. PLEASE NOTE THAT CERTAIN ITEMS ARE SOLD “AS IS” OR “FINAL SALE” EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW. ITEMS SOLD “AS IS” OR “FINAL SALE” CANNOT BE RETURNED OR EXCHANGED. WHEN APPLICABLE, THIS WILL BE SPECIFIED AT THE TIME OF SALE.
ALL MERCHANDISE SOLD BY PRINCETON IS SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURERS. ACCORDINGLY, PRINCETON MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY MERCHANDISE SOLD. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, PRINCETON EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO MERCHANDISE SOLD THROUGH THE PRINCETON SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL PRINCETON, ITS SUPPLIERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM ANY MERCHANDISE SOLD THROUGH THE PRINCETON SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL PRINCETON'S LIABILITY EXCEED THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THE MERCHANDISE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING THE LAW OF NEW JERSEY, MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
MOBILE SERVICES. The Services may include certain services that are available to you via your mobile phone or other mobile device if you have subscribed to them, including the ability to use your mobile device to receive and reply to messages from Princeton("text alerts"), and access certain other features (collectively, the "Mobile Services"). Although Princeton does not charge you for these Mobile Services, your mobile carrier's normal messaging, data, and other rates and fees will still apply to your use of the Mobile Services. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices. Therefore, you are responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile devices, what restrictions (if any) may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you.
By using the Mobile Services, you agree that Princeton may communicate with you by auto-dialed SMS, MMS, or other electronic means to your mobile device and that certain information about your usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to Princeton. Your consent to receive text messages and participation in Mobile Services is not a condition for your purchasing any Merchandise. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your mobile subscription account information to ensure that the messages Princeton intends to send to you are not sent to another person who acquires your former mobile telephone number.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND PRINCETON EACH AGREE TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON A BILATERAL (INDIVIDUAL) BASIS. You and Princeton agree that any dispute, controversy or claim between you and Princeton which cannot be settled through the customer service department refunding your payments in full (if applicable) and which arises out of or relates to (i) these Terms of Use; (ii) any aspect of your relationship with Princeton, including the Princeton Services and\or your purchase or attempted purchase of Merchandise from Princeton; (iii) any Content and\or Submissions; or (iv) Princeton's marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, push notifications, and telemarketing calls, irrespective of whether the dispute, controversy or claim arose after the termination of the relationship between you and Princeton, the Services and\or the Mobile Services (collectively, "Claims"), shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes Claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. You understand and agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to assert or defend your rights; provided, however, either you or Princeton may bring an individual lawsuit in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply. The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with only those exceptions provided under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq. (“FAA”), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
Class Action Waiver. Princeton and you each agree that each and both of the Parties are waiving the right to a trial by jury and may bring Claims against the other party only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative or collective proceeding. All arbitrations under this Arbitration Agreement shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide or collective) basis and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide or collective relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Use specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver"). If a court decides that the limitations of this paragraph are invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
Informal Dispute Resolution Requirement. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought. All notices to Princeton shall be sent to the following address:  Princeton Watches, c\o Legal Department, 6740 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55344. All notices sent by Princeton to you will be sent to the email and/or mailing address provided in your Princeton Account. Upon receipt of such notice, the other Party shall have a sixty (60) day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim and/or providing all the relief requested in the notice, and/or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the Parties. After the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, you or Princeton may commence an arbitration proceeding. Both you and Princeton agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.
Right to Opt Out of this Arbitration Agreement. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the first 30 days after the earliest of the first time you (a) make a purchase from Princeton; or (b) sign up for any program or service provided by Princeton. You may also opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after we provide notice of a material change to this Arbitration Agreement. (Please see These Terms of Use May Change, below.) You may opt out by sending an email to sales@princetonwatches.com or by sending a letter to Princeton Watches, c\o Legal Department, 6740 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55344. You should include your printed name, mailing address, and the words “Reject Arbitration.”
Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration of any Claim under this Agreement shall be referred to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. These rules and procedures, including information on how to initiate arbitration, are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its website (www.adr.org). Unless you and Princeton agree otherwise, including to conduct arbitration by telephone or video conference, the arbitration of any Claim shall be conducted in the State in which you reside, and Princeton will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration; and (2) not seek attorney's fees in the event Princeton prevails. Each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.
Governing Law and Other Terms. This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the FAA and other applicable federal law. To the extent state law applies to any aspect of this Arbitration Agreement, or to Claims that are covered by the Arbitration Agreement, the law of the State of Minnesota, will govern. Princeton will provide notice of any material changes to this Arbitration Agreement. (Please see These Terms of Use May Change, below.) Except as set forth above regarding the Class Action Waiver provision, if a court decides that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, such determination will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement. Only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this Agreement, including whether any dispute falls within its scope. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action/representative waiver above must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver.
