Factory dyed ‘tinted’ glass like on this new OEM utility vehicle may not stop the sun’s dangerous UV rays from damaging your skin and eyes, possibly leading to skin cancer and cataracts.
#Windowfilm does. Professionally installed #windowfilm blocks 99% of UV rays. Dyed dark glass may even absorb heat, window film rejects heat based on the film’s performance criteria. https://iwfa.com/home/fbclid/iwar0q_zdebbee-jrf2onfxoz9twsfxlmmblwbq8l7tfspkkzkkc7-rdkdwig
