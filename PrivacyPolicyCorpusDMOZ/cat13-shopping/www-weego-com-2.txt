Privacy Notice
This policy describes how Weego GmbH and affiliate companies (collectively, “Weego,” “we,” or “us”) collect, use and share information collected through the mail and wholesale accounts, Weego.com and other websites that link to this privacy policy, and Weego mobile services (collectively, the “Weego Services”).
HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)
We may collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) such as your name, your contact information, your shipping information, and your billing information (such as credit card account data). We collect PII when you provide it to us through your use of the Weego Services, for example when you interact with our websites, place an order, or sign up for our mailing list. We also receive limited PII when you choose to download or request the App. We may combine the PII we collect with additional information from other third-party sources.
We use the PII that we collect to provide the Weego Services (such as to process and ship your orders or respond to customer service requests), to analyze and improve the Weego Services, and to conduct marketing. If you register for email or if you provide your email address to us, we will send you emails about a variety of topics such as store events, new products, special sales, promotional offers from our affiliates or other selected business partners, environmental issues, and employment opportunities. Please see below for your choices regarding how we collect, use, and share your PII.
We share email activity data with our marketing email provider to help them better target email deployments to consumers. While our marketing email provider has access to email address and email activity and may share bulk/non-specific activity data, no Email addresses or specific email actions are ever shared with other third parties. Should a consumer wish to opt out of this sharing, that consumer simply needs to opt out of marketing email from us.
Non-Personal Information
We automatically collect certain non-personal information when you use Weego Services. For example, we collect information about the devices you use to connect to our services (such as the IP address of your computer or numeric identifier of your mobile device) and about how you use Weego Services (such as what time you visit our websites). We, and our advertisers and ad servers, may also collect non-personal information outside the Weego Services to measure the success of our advertising campaigns. We use the non-personal information that we collect for a variety of purposes such as to provide and improve the Weego Services, and to analyze and offer our advertising.
Our website also uses third-party analytics vendors such as Google Analytics.Please click here for more information about how data is collected and processed in connection with the Google Analytics service: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. We and our third-party vendors or partners use analytics data for a variety of purposes such as to improve the design and content of our websites, to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to all of our visitors and what promotions visitors like to see, and to gauge the success of our advertising campaigns.
