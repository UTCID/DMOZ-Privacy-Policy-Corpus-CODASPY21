Enhance your shopping experience
Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any contact information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain addresses from which people visit us and analyze this data for preferences, trends, and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.
Customer information, except for credit card data which falls under PCI industry standards, is maintained in a secure server along with your purchase history for an undetermined period of time.
Periodically we may establish business relationships with other outside persons or entities who we believe trustworthy and with privacy policies consistent with ours. In such cases, we may rent, exchange, cross reference or share information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.
To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in our Showroom or through our catalog. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our service partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate about our products and events that may be of interest to you and for other promotional purposes.
Additionally, we may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc, and we provide these partners with the information needed for them to perform such services. We also ask them to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours.
Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your contact information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to American Frame or to others. We may also disclose your contact information when we believe the law or legal process requires it.

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive direct marketing from us or from our service partners, or if you would like to opt out of our rental or exchange of your information with other marketers, please let us know by calling 1.800.537.0944 or by email at privacy@americanframe.com. Please be sure to include your full name, email address, mailing address, and specify what information you do not want to receive.
