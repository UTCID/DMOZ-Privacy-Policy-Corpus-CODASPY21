Privacy Policy
Terms and Conditions
Legal Notices
Slide-Lok Modular Storage Systems, Inc. ("Slide-Lok") makes information and products available on this web site, subject to the following terms and conditions. By accessing this site, you agree to these terms and conditions. Slide-Lok reserves the right to change these terms and conditions, and the products, services, prices, and programs mentioned in this site at any time, at its sole discretion, without notice. Slide-Lok reserves the right to seek all remedies available by law and in equity for any violation of these terms and conditions. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
Terms and Conditions of Sale
Prices and merchandise are subject to change without notice. All prices are plus shipping, handling and sales tax unless otherwise indicated.
Return Policy
The original purchaser has a period of 10 days from receipt of the goods to return any purchase for a full refund, less shipping and handling, provided the merchandise is in new, resaleable condition and returned in the original, undamaged packaging. Customer is responsible for return freight. All returns require a "RGA" - Returned Goods Authorization, which can be obtained by calling 1-800-835-1759. All parts and accessories must be included as well as the original box(s) in which the items were shipped. All returns are subject to a restocking fee of twenty percent (20%). Used items may not be returned. Acceptance of returned merchandise is final only after inspection by Slide-Lok. Refunds will be issued by check or credited to the credit card used for the purchase within five (5) business days after return, if the return is approved.
Warranty
Slide-Lok warrants that is products shall be free, under normal use and service, from defects in materials or workmanship for the life of the product from date of purchase. This warranty does not cover ordinary wear and tear, misuse or neglect of the product, or damage by a common carrier.
A claim under this Limited Warranty may be made by calling 800-835-1759. You must retain your original sales order and receipt to make a valid claim.
Slide-Lok shall have a reasonable length of time, after notice and recognition of a claim of defect hereunder, to remedy such defect by repair or replacement in accordance with this Limited Warranty.
DISCLAIMER: Slide-Lok's LIABILITY UNDER THIS WARRANTY IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE COST OF MATERIAL FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE GOODS AND SHALL NOT EXTEND TO OR INCLUDE ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OF CHARACTER.
Shipping
Most items will be shipped by common carrier (truck).
If the item is being shipped to a residential location, a residential delivery charge may apply. This includes an order being shipped to a "business" that is being operated from a residence. We make every effort to include residential delivery charges in our freight charges quoted at the time of sale. If a residential delivery charge is imposed after the sale, we reserve the right to charge the customer for such additional fees.
Most truck shipments will be via truck with lift gates. If a shipment is made via a truck without a lift gate, the customer may be responsible for unloading the item(s) from the truck and transporting the item(s) into their house/business. Truck driver may not assist in off-loading items if delivery is made via a truck without a lift gate.
In the event a customer refuses shipment after shipping from the factory, the customer will be responsible for all freight charges to and from the shipping location and a restocking fee of twenty percent (20%) may be imposed.
In the event a customer requests to pick up a shipment at a local freight company terminal and the customer does not pick up the shipment, the customer is responsible for the cost of shipping both to and from the freight terminal and a restocking fee of twenty percent (20%) may be imposed.
Any merchandise return which does not adhere to this policy, will be returned freight collect to the customer.
Shipping Times
We process internet orders during our regular business hours (M-F 7:30am -4pm). Most orders will ship within twenty four hours. Please allow up to 5 to 7 business days for shipping on most items.
We endeavor to ship products to our customers from the nearest Slide-Lok or Slide-Lok authorized master dealer warehouse to minimize freight charges and shipping time. You may receive more than one package for large orders. There will not be any additional shipping charges because of multiple deliveries.
Shipping Damage
You must notify Slide-Lok within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any products in the event you claim any products are damaged in shipment. Slide-Lok will contact the freight shipper and handle freight claims on your behalf. To notify Slide-Lok of a freight claim, call 800-835-1759.

Order Acceptance Policy
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. Slide-Lok.com reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. Title to goods passes to you upon delivery to the common carrier. Slide-Lok.com reserves the right to require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.

Price Comparisons
"List Price" and "You Save". Price comparisons may be made throughout the site to indicate the relative savings amounts of our pricing. "LIST PRICE" is the suggested retail price. We make no representation that a substantial number of these products have been sold or offered for sale at the list price. Actual retail prices in your area may be substantially different. Because we sell our products over the internet on a national basis, and through dealers on a national basis, it is not possible to know if our products are sold at list price in any particular location or at any particular time. "YOU SAVE" reflects the difference between our current offered price and the list price shown on our sites. Because the list price may be different than the actual retail prices in your area, you may not actually realize a savings of this amount and may want to make an exact comparison for yourself by checking the prices of local Slide-Lok dealers.
