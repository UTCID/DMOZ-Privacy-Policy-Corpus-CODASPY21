Answers
What do OP and TR stand for?
The letters OP and TR are abbreviations for Opaque and Transparent. An Opaque bead is a solid color that light cannot pass through. Transparent beads allow light to pass through the bead. For example, a glass of milk would be considered opaque while a glass of iced tea would be considered transparent.

I cannot see your enlargement pictures. Why?
For your convenience, all of our enlargement photos open into a smaller, new window so that you don't have to navigate back to the page you were viewing and wait for it to load again. If you are using browser pop-up controls or blockers you might experience problems. To avoid problems, we recommend that you temporarily disable pop-up controls when visiting our site. Rest assured that we do not engage in any sort of popup advertising.

Why can't you reply to my AOL email address?
AOL uses very agressive anti spam filters. While it is great for reducing spam it causes major problems for legitimate business emails which are also flagged as spam by AOL. We do not want our AOL customers to think that we did not reply to their inquiry when the truth is that we did reply but AOL bounced it.  AOL tells us that the end user (you) has the ability to control the agressiveness of their personal spam filter. However, it has been our experience that many AOL users do not know this and do not have their email set to be able to receive our responses to your inquiry.
