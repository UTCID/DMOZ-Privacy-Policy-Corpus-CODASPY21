Privacy Policy
At Pacific Cookie Company, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, phone number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
Pacific Cookie Company will never disclose or send promotional information to recipient addresses. Furthermore, we will not send you any promotional notices unless you specifically ask us to.
How does Pacific Cookie Company protect customer information?
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Plus, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
What about "cookies"?
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide a quick shopping experience. Most on-line shopping carts use cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. If you choose to disable cookies, our shopping cart will still function, but might be a little bit slower because the shopping cart needs to store your shopping information on the Pacific Cookie Company server as you shop, rather than on your own hard drive (which is faster to access).
Will Pacific Cookie Company disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
Pacific Cookie Company does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. Pacific Cookie Company may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Pacific Cookie Company, our users, or others.
