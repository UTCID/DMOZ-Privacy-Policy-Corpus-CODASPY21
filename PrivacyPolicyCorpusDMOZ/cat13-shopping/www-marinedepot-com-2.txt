You can learn more about filing these returns from your taxing authority.
Pricing
We offer quite possibly the lowest prices on the products in our store. We constantly work toward maintaining competitive prices on everything we carry. All prices are listed in U.S. dollars. (We do not have a currency converter in our store, but several Web sites provide this service. Any order placed on MarineDepot.com will be charged in U.S. dollars.)
If you think our pricing for a particular item isn't competitive with that of other online retailers, you can notify us by emailing Marketing@MarineDepot.com.
In certain instances, MarineDepot.com will not lower our prices. Some instances where we will not lower our prices are as follows:
Competitor’s product is not an exact match (make and or model) with ours.
Competitor’s total price (which includes shipping, handling, rebates, taxes, etc.) is higher.
Competitor with the lowest price is out of stock.
Competitors product is refurbished, reconditioned, etc.
Product is a closeout or clearance item(either at our site or the competitors)
Competitor is not manufacturer authorized.
In the event a product listed on our website is labeled with an incorrect price due to some typographical, informational, technical or other error, MarineDepot.com shall at its sole discretion have the right to refuse and/or cancel any order for said product and immediately amend, correct and/or remove the inaccurate information.
MSRP
Except where noted, the MSRP displayed for products on our website represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice. The MSRP is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day.
MAP Policies
We negotiate with product manufacturers to secure the lowest possible pricing so we can pass the savings along to shoppers and hopefully earn their business. We also work with brands to offer shoppers even greater incentives throughout the year, like bulk discounts, seasonal markdowns and other special promotions (like a free item with purchase, for example).
However, a small number of the 180+ brands we carry cannot be discounted due to minimum advertised price (MAP) rules. The good news for shoppers is that we always sell these items for the lowest prices allowed by their manufacturers to ensure you always pay the lowest price when you shop with us.
The following list contains all of the brands that currently have MAP price restrictions:

Placing an Order
If you did not receive an order confirmation via email, even though you clicked the submit order button, we recommend that you contact us via email at customercare@marinedepot.com or call us at 1-714-385-0080 to confirm that we received your order, and to further assist you.
Order Tracking
Once you place an order with MarineDepot.com and the order is processed, you will receive an email confirmation that same day with your tracking number. To track your order, please go to our website and log in.
Order Status
We will do everything possible to keep you informed of your order via email. Tracking numbers are sent via email once they are available. The emails are usually sent on the evening of your order ship date by UPS, FedEx or the selected courier. On the rare occasion that you do not receive this information, you may email us at customercare@marinedepot.com or give us a call at 1-714-385-0080 for your order status or tracking number. We will also contact you via email, unless noted otherwise, if there are any issues regarding your order.
How to Cancel an Order
We begin processing orders immediately after they are placed on our website. If you need to cancel an order before it ships from one of our warehouses, you have a small window of opportunity to do so. You can sign into your account to cancel the order yourself online if the order hasn't already begun processing. You can also call us at 1-714-385-0080 within 5-10 minutes of placing your order so we can try cancelling it for you. We will make every effort to honor your cancellation request! If your order has already entered the shipping process, unfortunately we are unable to grant your cancellation request.
Shoppers generally appreciate how quickly we process and pack orders. However, we understand this can be frustrating should you decide to cancel an order before it ships and are informed it’s too late. Don’t worry, though: you can request a RMA number (Return Merchandise Authorization) within 60 days of the date your order ships and send the item back to us for a refund with no restocking fee.
Product Availability
The availability on each item's product page refers only to how long it will take that item to leave our warehouses once you place your order. It does not include the time your order will take to reach you once we ship it. Shipping time depends upon the carrier who is shipping your product and shipment method. The following is a list of the several types of availability estimates you might see for items in our stores.
Shoppers generally appreciate how quickly we process and pack orders.

Usually ships in 24 hours: we expect to ship your order within 24 hours of your order. Because these items often enter the shipping process immediately, it is difficult to modify an order containing items that usually ship in 24 hours. When ordering such items, please double-check the details of your order before submitting it.
Usually ships in 2-3 days: we expect to receive the item from our vendors and ship it to you within 2 to 3 days of your order.
Usually ships in 1-2 weeks: we expect to receive the item from our vendors and ship it to you within 1 to 2 weeks of your order.
Back Ordered: our vendors are unable to predict when they will have more of your product in stock, but we hope to be able to ship it to you within 3 to 5 weeks.
Limited availability: This means the product you have chosen to purchase has a very limited stock available. We will inform you by e-mail if any items in your order prove to be unavailable.
Promotional Offers
On frequent occasions MarineDepot.com will have great promotional offers available. When taking advantage of one, be sure to read the entire list of restrictions associated with that promotion. If your order does not seem to reflect all the benefits mentioned in the promotion, you may want to review the specific promotion's restrictions. To qualify for a specific promotion, your order must be placed during the specified promotion period. We are unable to apply special discounts to items ordered before or after the dates of a promotional offer.
Coupon Exclusions
While the exact terms and conditions of each individual coupon offer will vary, typically products that are out of stock, already on sale, shipped to you directly by the manufacturer (drop shipped), or brands that have Minimum Advertised Price policies will be ineligible for any discounts. Below are brands that will usually be exempt from any coupon offer:
