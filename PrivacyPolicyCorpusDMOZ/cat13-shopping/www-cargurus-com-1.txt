recognize browser “do not track” signals. However, several of our partners who
utilize these cookies, beacons and tools on our site enable you to opt out of
this interest-based advertising.
Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance

against unauthorized access to your personal information. Technical measures
that we have implemented also include use of firewall protection and, in
appropriate instances, encryption technology. Although we take reasonable
precautions to assess the reliability of such technology, we rely on the
statements of the vendors of those products and services as part of its
security evaluation. While we have endeavored to create a secure and reliable
site for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material
transmitted to/from the site, and the security of your personal information,
cannot be guaranteed. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your

request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the
business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business
has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is
the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the
business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal
information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to
submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us
as at privacy @cargurus.com.

law. If you are accessing the site from outside of the U.S., please be aware
that information collected through the site may be transferred to, processed,
stored, and used in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Data protection laws in
the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be different from those of your country
of residence. Your use of the site or provision of any information therefore
constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage,
sharing, and storage of information about you in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions as set out in this Privacy Policy.

COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected
information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us at
privacy @cargurus.com. We will remove the data to the extent required by
applicable laws.

old who are California residents without their affirmative authorization.
If you are a California resident under 18 years old and registered to use the
site, you can ask us to remove any content or information you have posted on
the site. To make a request, email us at the email address set out in “Contact
Us” section with “California Under 18 Content Removal Request” in the subject

practices. When we post modifications to this Privacy Policy, we will revise
