Policies
Privacy
We are concerned with the privacy of ourselves as well as our customers. The following privacy policy describes how we will use the information gathered by The Busy Bunny® - this includes telephone, e-mail, postal mail, and online orders.
We will only collect the information required to complete a sale.
We will never sell or share this information.
We protect this information by:
Utilizing a secure server for e-commerce
Limiting access to our data files - only authorized employees can view these files
Firewall and Password protection of our computers.
We want to begin sending newsletters and updates via email and our new store has an 'opt-in' system. This means that only people who request to receive these messages will receive them. If, at any time, you wish to be removed from our database please let us know. Every newsletter and update message will include an opt-out link; order notification messages (confirmations, shipping information, tracking, etc) will not include this link. We will remove you promptly and notify you that it has been done - but we will be sad.
If there are any questions or comments, please let us know.
Returns
Please feel free to return any items purchased from The Busy Bunny® or received as a gift. We ask that the items be returned within 14 days of receipt. We understand that gifts and orders outside the US may take longer. The policy below is a guideline; we can be less stringent enforcing this policy at our own discretion. If you wish to make a return, please call us toll free at 1-877-998-8669 (707 772-5120 outside the US) or email.
Food items that have been opened or used, or clothing items and earrings that have been washed and/or worn cannot be returned.

Repack the product(s) in the original packaging materials.
Ship item(s) to the address provided to you.
For your own protection, insure the package for the full value of the order.

If you are returning a product because it was defective or we shipped an item in error, The Busy Bunny® will pay the return shipping costs.

A refund will be made in the same form of payment originally used for purchase. Expect the refund between 7 and 14 business days after we receive the returned item(s). You will be credited for the merchandise total and tax, if applicable. We do not normally credit the shipping and handling fees unless we made a mistake.
