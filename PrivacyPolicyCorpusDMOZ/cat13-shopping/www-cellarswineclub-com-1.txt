Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. Simply put, all information gathered through sales and promotions from our websites are not shared, sold or traded with any other company.
Your Personal Information
When you shop with Cellars Wine Club, any personal information that you may share with us is kept absolutely private. Neither your name nor anything about you is shared with or sold, given or traded to any outside company or agency.
Information You Provide Us
In several areas of Cellarswineclub.com, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting an online form. Following is a list of where we ask you for information and details on how we use the information.
Checkout
We ask for your name, address and contact information so we can send you your order, and so we can contact you if we have a question about your order. We ask for credit card information so we can fulfill your order, and so we can provide this information to the company or companies who process your credit card payment. We do not share any other information with third parties. We do not share or sell email addresses.
Email Special Offers
We ask for your email address so we may provide you with information about sales, events and other pertinent information. We do not sell or share email addresses with any third parties.
Additional Email Uses
After you place an order on our site, you will receive an email confirmation. Once your order has been processed, you will receive an email with shipping information. We do not sell or share email addresses with any third parties. We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our customers, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments. We read every email we receive.
How We Use Cookies
Cellarswineclub.com writes a cookie to your computer when you place an item in your shopping cart. This cookie contains no personal information and is used to identify your computer. The cookie allows us to maintain your shopping cart while you browse the site and if you happen to leave, you can return to our site and retain the items in your shopping cart. If you are a “cookie–phobe,” you can set your browser to accept no cookies, or tell it to erase all cookies at the end of a session.
Security
At Cellarswineclub.com we take your security very seriously. We go to great lengths to keep your financial information private and safe. All credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected. You can purchase online with confidence. If you have further questions, please call us at 800-256-9853 or e-mail us, including your name and mailing address, at wineclub@cellarswineclub.com.
We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. When you’ve finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. A warning window may pop up to notify you that you are entering this “safe” area. Once you’ve entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or a closed lock will appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process.
