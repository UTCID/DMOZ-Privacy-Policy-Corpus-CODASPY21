2.Where do we deliver?
UK mainland – Prices on our website are inclusive of next working day UK delivery.
Scottish Highlands, Scottish Offshore Islands, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Isle of Wight, Scilly Islands, Channel Islands - Prices on our website are inclusive of the delivery.
European delivery is available for non-perishable gifts (gifts that do not contain cheese or smoked or fresh meat and fish).
International delivery is also available for non-perishable gifts (gifts that do not contain cheese or smoked or fresh meat and fish).
We regret we are unable to deliver to BFPO or PO box addresses.
3. How quickly can we deliver?
We offer Next Working Day Delivery to UK & Eire on orders placed Monday - Friday before 14:00 (GMT). Perishable gifts (that contain cheese or fresh/smoked meat or fish) cannot be delivered on a Monday as they cannot be held in storage over the weekend. In time for Christmas deliveries are made from the 1st December to 20th December.
4. Can we deliver on a specific date?Yes. Any working day can be selected for no additional charge at checkout (excluding orders placed in December). Mondays cannot be selected for perishable gifts.
5. Can we deliver on a Saturday or Sunday?We can deliver on a Saturday or Sunday if your order is placed before 14:00 (GMT) on the Friday before. Saturday delivery surcharge is £5.99 inc VAT, Sunday is £12.50 inc VAT. This service is for UK mainland only. For orders placed in December, this surcharge may increase.
6. Between which times do we deliver?Delivery is during working hours (8.30-6pm) Monday to Friday. Fresh food gifts are not despatched on a Friday. We cannot specify an actual time as the driver's routes change daily, however, please provide a mobile number for the recipient and the courier will provide greater timing detail the morning of the delivery and  if you input your tracking number into Parcelforce website here https://www.parcelforce.com/track-trace, you may get live updates on the day of your delivery if it is available in that area. If you think your recipient will be out at work during these times, why not ask us to deliver the gift to their work address?
7.  How is the COVID pandemic affecting your service?In these unprecedented times, we want to reassure you we care deeply about your gift purchase. We all continue to work with covid secure workplace practices, this includes the staff at Hay Hampers, our couriers, suppliers and producers. We are all striving hard with the thought of the ‘responsibility of your gift in our hands’, and we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding. We always put our commitment to our customers first and will continue to monitor (to the best of our abilities) what we feel confident in delivering. We hope you understand that sometimes issues are out of our control. As circumstances are ever changing, we provide a regularly updated Covid page here for up to date guidance on how the situation may affect our service and your gift purchase
8. What happens if the recipient is out?Ideally, you should ensure you are delivering to an address on a date that someone is available to receive and sign for the gift. Should the recipient be out when our courier attempts delivery and no one is available to accept delivery, they post a card through the letterbox, or send a text to the provided mobile number, advising the recipient that they have attempted delivery and inviting them to telephone our courier to arrange either:
A collection from the nearest depot, which is available the working day after the card was left
Re-delivery to the original address during normal working hours
If they do not hear anything, they will attempt delivery a second time the next day. Beyond that, it will be held in the depot for 5 days awaiting a response from the communication.
We try our best when possible to contact you if we can see the delivery has not been successful, however, we also advise watching the delivery on the courier tracking sites using the tracking numbers we provide in our despatch emails (please ensure our email address is added to your address book - sales@hampers.co.uk)
Any parcels not delivered or collected within five working days will be automatically returned to Hay Hampers.  A charge of £12.00 including VAT (£10.00 + £2.00 vat @ 20%) is made for re-delivery to the original or alternative address.  A charge will also be made for any items which become unsuitable for sale and need replacing (perishable and chilled items like smoked foods, hams and cheeses which have short shelf lives).Our guarantee is limited to delivering to the building, not individual recipients.
9. Can the parcel be left with a neighbour?Yes, if you think that the recipient may be out on that day, please contact us via email at sales@hampers.co.uk to give us instructions to leave with a nominated neighbour. The courier will be informed of these instructions in writing. If you have provided a mobile number for the recipient, they will be informed of the delivery time via text and be given the option to request to leave with a neighbour or send to post office or deliver another day. The carrier will only be able to do this if a neighbour is available to take delivery.
10. Can the parcel be left safe i.e. in the porch, garage or shed?As a security measure we require a signature on receipt of delivery, therefore we will not take instructions from the recipient to leave a parcel safe unless we have authorisation from the sender. However, during the week before Christmas, due to the volume of parcels being delivered, the couriers occasionally request permission to leave safe.
11. What happens if you give us the wrong address?If the courier is having difficulties making delivery, they will contact us for further instructions. It is very important that your recipient's address is up to date with correct postcode and telephone number for contact in case the driver has difficulty locating the address. We will contact you if there are difficulties and ask for further instructions.The courier charges a redirection fee of £12.00 (£10.00 + £2.00 vat @ 20%)  if required to be delivered to another address once in transit.If the courier is unable to make delivery the gift is returned to us.  A courier re-send fee of £12.00 (£10.00 + £2.00 vat @ 20%), plus any fresh food needing to be replaced, will be charged.
12. Can you track your order?
Your UK mainland order is scanned onto the courier's van from our warehouse and can be tracked up to delivery at recipient's address. We include the tracking number for your gift on the notification of despatch email we send to the email you provide. Please ensure that our email (sales@hampers.co.uk) is added to your address book to be certain this does not accidentally go to your junk mail. You can then track the order on the specific courier's tracking websites. This frequently includes live updates of expected delivery times and live updates of where the driver is on his route.  You can also view the signature of the person that took the delivery.
13. How do you know if your gift has been delivered safely?When you select our gift card and enter your personal message in the shopping basket, we will automatically enter your name and telephone number for the recipient to contact you to say the gift has arrived. You can also use the tracking number provided in the despatch notification email to view the current status of the parcel. All our couriers store signatures on delivery which are available to view on their tracking sites and some also save photographs of the delivered parcel and GPS proof.
14. What should you do if the parcel is lost or damaged?Delivery services have significantly improved in recent years, so in the unlikely event of damage or loss in transit, we will replace the damaged contents or gift immediately free of charge providing the following:
The goods are signed for upon receipt as damaged or have been refused because of obvious damage
The courier and ourselves are informed at once and it is confirmed by the recipient to us in writing within a reasonable time of delivery quoting reference number on the parcel. Our couriers recommend that any damage which cannot be seen from the outside must be notified to the couriers & Hay Hampers in writing within 7 days.
Damaged goods must be retained for inspection and it may be required that they are returned to us at our expense before replacement or refund.
All claims must be submitted within a reasonable time. Our couriers recommend a maximum of fourteen days.
Returned goods must clearly show the full name, address and telephone number of the sender.
We cannot accept responsibility for the wrong order or non-delivery, resulting from incorrect information or addresses being provided.
There are instructions on the gift card to the recipient detailing how to contact us in the event of a problem with their gift.
15. Can I include a gift card with a message?A personalised greeting card is included with your gift free of charge. You may enter a different message for each gift or the same. These will be printed onto gift cards and we will also enter your name and telephone number automatically on the left-hand side of the card. This enables the recipient to ring you to say it has arrived safely. The gift card design changes from season to season and can be viewed here. If you do not put a gift message in the checkout, no gift card will be included. If you wish to send us your own cards or compliment slips we will insert these for you free of charge.If you choose not to include a card or compliment slip, then the recipient will not know from whom it has come. If they call to request sender information we will not issue this due to data protection.
16. How do I use Promotional Codes?When you have a promotional code, you will be asked for it at the checkout. The value will be automatically deducted from your order. The code is case sensitive and must be identically written.
17. If I give you my personal details will you hassle me or pass on my details?In accordance with GDPR, we do not telephone private customers unless we need information regarding your order. If you tick the brochure box on our web site, we will send you our new brochure.If you tick the box for emails, we will contact you each season to offer gifts for birthdays, summer events, etc. We do talk to our corporate customers on a regular basis, send emails with seasonal gifts and mail the brochure each September unless you instruct us to do otherwise.We do not pass on any personal details to a third party. Your credit card details are not held on our database.
18. I wish to order several gifts to different addresses, which is the best way to enter these?The My Address Book will hold 30 names and addresses of your family, friends, work colleagues and customers, which you can amend, update and change whenever you wish by entering your secure area via your login email address and password.However, if you are sending to more than ten different addresses for a corporate order, we recommend you fill in our spreadsheet and discuss the order with our specialist corporate sales department. Call 01476 550420 and we will assign you an account manager.
19. Can I combine parcels to one delivery address?If you are sending more than ten parcels to the same address then we may be able to save you some money on delivery charges. Please email sales@hampers.co.uk or telephone 01476 550 420 for a quotation.Large orders to one address may be delivered on our own transport to the location and date specified by yourselves or sent out via a courier on pallets.
20. I have made an error entering a name, address or despatch date or I have just discovered the recipient has moved address or will not be in on that date.Contact us via email sales@hampers.co.uk or telephone 01476 550 420 immediately and we'll amend it for you, providing it has not been processed for despatch.
21. Do you offer discounts for large orders?Yes. If you think your order will come to over £750, please email sales@hampers.co.uk or telephone 01476 550 420 for a quotation for a volume discount.
22. Can we pay by any other method than credit card?Yes, you can pay by debit card, paypal or cheque (although the order will not be processed until we have received your cheque and it has cleared).If you wish to order a large amount and wish to pay by company cheque or BACS, please email sales@hampers.co.uk or telephone 01476 550 420 with your request.
23. Can I build my own hamper?We offer a range of over 400 hamper gifts and as such, we hope you can find something to suit your budget and needs. If you are ordering a number of the same gift it may be possible to design your own hamper but this depends on volume, the time of year and our ability to accommodate your needs. Please ask to speak to our corporate sales specialists. If you feel there is a big hole in our assortment then please do let us know (sales@hampers.co.uk) and we will try to take this into consideration when planning our next season's gifts
24. Why does my added delivery address say 'This address is unsuitable for delivery'?We can send our non-perishable hampers to most international locations but some countries have very complex customs restrictions, alcohol/liquid/chocolate prohibitions, large custom charges or very poor postal service and so we do not deliver to them. Included in the countries we cannot deliver to are USA, most of the Middle East, and some others.
Sorry, we are fully booked for Christmas! We are taking orders for delivery from 11th January.
This year, Christmas may not be quite what we are all used to, but we can all send food and love to those we will be missing and connect with them in different ways. In these unprecedented times, we want to reassure you we care deeply about your gift purchase and provide a regularly updated Covid page here to provide guidance on how we are monitoring the situation in relation to our service.
