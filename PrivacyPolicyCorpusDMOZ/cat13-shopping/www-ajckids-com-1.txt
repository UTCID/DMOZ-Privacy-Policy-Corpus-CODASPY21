What we collect
Any personal information that we may collect, is information you send to us. So if you sign up for our mailing list, we collect your email address. This should make sense to most people. So we collect the following information (again, if submitted to us):
Your name
contact information including email address
demographic information such as postcode, preferences and interests
other information relevant to customer surveys and/or offers
What we do with the information we gather
We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:
Internal record keeping.
We may use the information to improve our products and services.
We may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided, but only when you specifically sign up for our mail list. We hate spam and excess emails just as much as you do!
We may contact you by email, phone, fax or mail if we have questions related to your order.
Fax? Why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
