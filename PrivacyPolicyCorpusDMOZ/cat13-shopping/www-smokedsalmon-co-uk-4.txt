Environmental Policy
Who We Are
Environmental & Sustainability Policy
Each one of us at Inverawe Smokehouses, has a moral obligation to safeguard each other, our customers and the environment by aspiring to operate a safe, injury free and healthy workplace manufacturing food that is always safe to eat and to minimise our impact on the environment.
As a minimum we will comply with all relevant environmental legislation and approved codes of practice. In locations where we are not directly responsible for plant, equipment and vehicles, we will liaise with our suppliers to consider how best to improve the environmental performance of our operations.
To ensure each of us play our part in reducing the impact of what we do on the global environment, we have developed a clear set of objectives against which we will measure and report on our environmental performance.
Specifically, we will:
Actively seek to reduce the waste and energy used within our premises.
Reduce waste packaging, where appropriate, in our supply chain.
Working with our suppliers we will aim to source raw and secondary materials from the most sustainable and/or recyclable resources as possible.
Ensure that all our employees are provided with the information, training, and tools necessary to implement responsible environmental and social practices.
It is my responsibility as Managing Director to ensure that the appropriate resources, including human and financial, are committed towards implementing this policy across all our operations and communicating our policies and standards across all our operations and communicating our policies, procedures and standards to all our employees.
The board will review this policy annually to ensure it continues to reflect the objectives of the company. We will report annually at the board meeting on our progress.
Patrick Campbell - PrestonManaging Director.
Inverawe Smokehouse began with just one smokebox. Today we are proud to be one of the biggest mail order companies and one of the most renowned smokehouses in Scotland and holders of the Royal Warrant. Our smokehouse products are famous for their gorgeous smoky, full-bodied flavour.
Our traditional way of wood smoking flies in the face of modern production because we rely on real people taking their time and using age-old skills rather than cutting corners with rows of machines. But we think you'll agree when you taste our hot smoked salmon, or any of our many other smoked foods, that the end result is worth the wait.
Although this way is more time consuming and labour intensive, the end result surpasses all expectations.
Smoking is one of the oldest ways of preserving foods and at Inverawe Smokehouses we continued this ancient art in our traditional smokehouse design.
This method retains the real taste of properly smoked Scottish fish.
