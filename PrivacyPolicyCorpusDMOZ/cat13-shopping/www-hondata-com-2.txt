Purchase & Order Policies and Procedures
You may make purchases and order from Hondata.com only in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and accompanying policies and procedures.
You acknowledge that by placing an order to purchase with Hondata.com, you have entered into a legally binding enforceable agreement. Prices and availability are subject to change, without notice.
When placing an order on the Site, the price at which your order is submitted is the guaranteed price. An “order number” will subsequently be forwarded to you via email. Your credit card information is required to guarantee all paper check and bank wire orders. For orders placed and for which payment will be made by bank wire, your payment must be received within one (1) business day in order to reserve your guaranteed price. For orders placed and for which payment will be made by check, all check orders must be postmarked for delivery within one (1) business day and payment received, in its entirety, within ten (10) calendar days of the original order.
A received payment is denoted by the receipt of funds in our bank account (wire transfer payment), or by the deposit of payment (check). Subject to our sole discretion, orders may be denied if payment is received after the aforementioned time frame. If we do choose to accept late payment, a $35 late payment fee will be assessed, in addition to any Market Losses between the order date and time of late-payment.
If any order is in error, due to Hondata’s fault or otherwise, we reserve the right to cancel the order. Without limiting any other legal or equitable rights and remedies that may be available to Hondata.com, in the event of any failure by you to comply with these Terms and Conditions, Hondata.com may suspend or terminate your account. The suspension or the termination of your account shall not affect your obligations as set forth in these Terms and Conditions.
Additional terms, including, without limitation, prices, payment methods, refund and cancellation policies, and exchange policies may be posted from time to time on the Site.
Fraud
We reserve the right, but undertake no obligation, to actively report and prosecute actual and suspected credit card fraud. We may, in our sole discretion, require further authorization from you such as a telephone confirmation of your order and other information. We reserve the right to cancel, delay, refuse to ship, or recall from the shipper any order, if fraud is suspected. We capture certain information during the order process, including, without limitation, information that will be used to locate and identify individuals committing fraud. If any Site order is suspected to be fraudulent, we reserve the right, but undertake no obligation, to submit all records, with or without a subpoena, to all law enforcement agencies and to the credit card company for fraud investigation. We reserve the right to cooperate with authorities to prosecute offenders to the fullest extent of the law.
Payment Options
Payment to Hondata.com must be completed using a credit/debit card. Depending upon the amount of an order, Hondata.com reserves the right to request additional documentation or information to process certain credit card orders. By choosing to pay with a credit or debit card, you expressly authorize Hondata.com to authorize and capture your credit card payment prior to shipment.
Hondata.com expressly reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order, for any reason, in its sole discretion, regardless of payment method and price confirmation.
Cancellation Policy
Once you have placed an order with Hondata you have entered into a binding legal agreement, and cannot cancel the confirmed order without incurring a $35.00 administrative fee and being charged for the corresponding Market Losses.
After Hondata has shipped the product, the order is final and cannot be canceled. If you refuse shipment the product will be returned to us and you will be charged a $35.00 administrative fee, a standard 10% restocking fee and you will be required to pay for shipping, customs and duty costs.
Hondata reserves the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason or for no reason at all, regardless of payment method or price confirmation, including without limitation, for orders we deem questionable or suspicious, for orders Hondata deems to be a significant risk, when the confirmed price is incorrect, for abrupt movements in the precious metals market, and/or when Hondata does not receive payment within the allotted time frame.
We are not responsible for pricing or typographical errors and expressly reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to cancel any and all orders placed with respect to such items. In the event of a cancelled order Hondata will contact you directly with notification of the cancellation.
Return Policy
Our refund, return and exchange policy is limited to three (3) business days from the date that you receive the item. You must notify our Customer Service Department via telephone at 310-782-8278 within three (3) business days from the date that you receive the item and follow the instructions provided to you, at that time. Shipping and handling charges are non-refundable. You are fully responsible for all taxes, as well as return shipping and handling costs. Hondata may reject any returned or exchanged item that does not reasonably conform to these terms. In the case of a request for an exchange, Hondata expressly reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to find an acceptable replacement or refund your money should an acceptable replacement be unavailable. Please note, that a 10% restocking fee applies to any returned or exchanged items that were purchased via credit/debit card. Any and all market gains on refunds, returns, and exchanges shall belong solely to Hondata.
Shipment
Although we endeavor to ship all orders within three (3) business days, shipments may take up to thirty (30) days from completed payment, depending upon the manner of delivery. Note that this thirty (30) day period is IN ADDITION to all payment clearing times and any product-specific delays. Applicable taxes, as well as shipping and handling charges are not reflected. You are fully responsible for applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges. Packages may or may not require a signature upon delivery.
Hondata fully insures all of its shipments. Should anything happen while your package is in transit to you it will be covered by our insurance policy. However, we will not accept responsibility if you have left instructions with any carriers or delivery service to leave parcels unattended for you without the need for a signature or if you have given them instructions to leave your package with a third party.
When we ship to you, if products are lost or damaged in transit, Hondata assumes responsibility to pursue any claim with the insurance company. If we determine the package is lost or damaged, we will file a claim. Once the claim is filed, we reserve the right to re-ship your items or refund your money at our discretion.
Please note that Hondata will not be responsible for reimbursements or insurance claims on packages that are successfully delivered as addressed. Our liability and insurance ceases the moment the package is signed for or left at the specified delivery address as per carrier tracking and/or confirmation. Any issues or problems with a shipment MUST be reported within three (3) business days, else Hondata may have to refute any claims.
Export Compliance
Each product that Hondata sells is subject to all United States export laws. Therefore, no products may be exported or re-exported into, or to a national or resident of, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria or any country to which the United States has embargoed goods. Additionally, no products may be exported or re-exported to anyone on the United States Treasury Department’s list of specially designated nationals or the United States Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders.
Termination
Either you or Hondata may terminate these Terms and Conditions, for any reason, including convenience, with or without cause, at any time by written notice to the other party. The termination of these Terms and Conditions shall not affect the rights and the obligations of Hondata or you with respect to the period prior to the date of termination.
