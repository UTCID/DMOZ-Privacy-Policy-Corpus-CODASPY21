Privacy is important to Book By You.
We instruct our employees to keep your
information private. We will not sell or rent your name or specific information
regarding you to any third party. For purposes of providing you with quality
service, informing you about new products or services, inquiring about your
account status, or conducting business surveys, we collect and store
information about our relationship with you, and we keep it private.
For each visitor to our web site, our web server
automatically recognizes only the visitor's
domain name, but not the visitor's e-mail address
unless the visitor makes that available.
We aggregate information about what pages visitors access
and information that visitors volunteer such as survey or
book preview information. We may use the information we
collect to improve the content and layout of our web site,
to notify visitors about updates, and make comparable improvements.
Purchasing products or sending personalized previews automatically
subscribes you to receive information from Book By You.
