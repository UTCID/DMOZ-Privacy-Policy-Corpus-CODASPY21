Seller Charges and FeesOur Fee schedule is listed below.  There are no hidden costs or long-term contracts.
FeesEffective April 23, 2020
Setup Fee
None
Listing Fee
Free
Maintenance Fee
Up to 50 items: $54 per month
From item 51-150: 30 cents per item
From item 151-1000: 20 cents per item
From item 1001 on: 1 cent per item
Calculated and charged on the 1st of every month by counting all items, including Backroom, Sold, Sale Pending, AIP Pending, etc. For new shops, fee is prorated from the first full day after opening.
Service Fee
6.7% based on Purchase Order total (does not include Sales Tax), Capped at $250 *.
For a shop with up to 50 items, the minimum monthly cost of maintaining a shop on Ruby Lane is $54.
* Ruby Lane's Seller Service Fee shall not exceed $250 for each item reported sold (the Cap). The Cap also applies to multiple quantities of the same item in a Purchase Order. For example, 10 identical dinner plates at $500 each, for a total of $5,000, sold in one Purchase Order would ordinarily have generated a Seller Service Fee of $335 (6.7%). However, because the items are identical and because of the Cap, Ruby Lanes Seller Service Fee would only be $250. On the other hand, 3 separate, non-identical items reported sold at $500, $1,500 and $3,000, for a total of $5,000, sold in one Purchase Order, would not have the Cap applied. In this case, the Seller Service Fee would be $335 (6.7%).
More Details on Seller Charges and FeesYour Ruby Lane account is funded on a prepay basis, similar to the way most sellers sell their items online: you pay us first and then we provide services.Shop Fees can be paid using PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover credit cards. From your Accounting page, select Fund Account then choose your method of payment.
All Ruby Lane shops must have sufficient funds available in their Ruby Lane account by the 1st of the month to pay the fees due for the new month and click charges, if any, incurred in the prior month. Use the Projected Account Summary shown under Accounting, Current Balance at any time during the month to get an idea of how much you will need to have in your account by the 1st.
Your Ruby Lane account must be funded ahead of time with PayPal, or by entering your credit card information, and selecting a payment option. PayPal and credit card payments are credited to your account instantly, in most cases. It is important to know that it does take time to set up a new PayPal account, so plan accordingly if you do not already have an account.
If there are insufficient funds in your Ruby Lane account on the 1st of the month:
your account balance will go negative
your statement found in the Statement History section of your accounting will indicate that payment is overdue
we extend a 15-day grace period to deposit sufficient funds
we may try to contact you by direct email
the grace period cannot be extended past the 15 days we offer
If there are still insufficient funds in your Ruby Lane account on the 16th of the month:
your shop and all linked shops are placed in preview (not open to the public)
a $25 late / re-open fee is added to your account
Please understand that this procedure is completely automated so exceptions cannot be made under any circumstances. It is your responsibility to ensure that sufficient funds are in your Ruby Lane account on the 1st. Shops that wait until the last minute to make payments run the risk of being put into preview because of technical glitches or other unforeseen circumstances.
If you have submitted a PayPal eCheck which did not clear your bank twice in the last year, and this scenario occurs for the third time in a year, you will be sent an email stating your shop has been placed in preview status and is no longer active on Ruby Lane. After approximately 72 business hours, your shop and all linked shops(s) will be permanently removed from our site. The 72 hours will allow you time to clear all outstanding transactions, copy all your shop data, including item descriptions, photos, history records, accounting records, reports, and other shop information because once your shop is removed, the data cannot be recovered.
If your shop has been placed in preview for insufficient funds three times in a 12 month period, your shop will not be eligible for reopening on Ruby Lane.
Shops who choose to close permanently and who have at least $1 in their account may request and receive a refund of their credit balance. Shops must make their refund request at the time of closing. For shops who close other than the last day of the month, maintenance fees will be pro-rated. Paid options such as Paid Featuring are non-refundable. Any non-refundable option will be clearly stated as such in advance. Shops will receive their refund 30 days from the time they request it, provided there are no unresolved transactions.

We have the sole authority and discretion to operate and maintain the Site.
Accordingly, we reserve the right to remove any item, picture, or posting from our Site at any time for any reason, without notice to any Buyer.
We are under no obligation to remove or change any item, picture, or posting from our Site at any Buyer's request and any such requests shall be resolved at our sole discretion.

We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, to reject any Buyer membership applications, and to discontinue existing service at any time. We also reserve the right to assist Sellers in blocking any Buyer from purchasing items from Seller's shop, to cancel Buyer's membership and deny access to our Site of any Buyer, due to Buyer's unprofessional conduct or practices, Seller complaints, and other reasons which we consider, at our sole discretion, to be disruptive to the business and reputation of our Site.

3. Release of Claims.
Our Site acts as the venue for Sellers to conduct sales and for Buyers to purchase Seller's items. We are not involved in the actual transaction between Buyers and Sellers. In the event you have a dispute with another Buyer or with a Seller, you hereby release Ruby Lane, Inc. (and our directors, officers, agents and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
