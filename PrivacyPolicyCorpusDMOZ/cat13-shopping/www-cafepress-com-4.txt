1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND WHY?
We collect information directly from you as a user of our Site and Services, such as when you use our Services
to
create or buy products that are uniquely you, sign up to receive special offers from us or register for an
account
with us. We also collect certain information automatically through your use of our Site or Services. Often, you
choose what information to provide, but sometimes we require certain information for you to use and for us to
provide you the Services.
1.1. Personal information you provide.
The term “personal information” refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual,
or
as defined under applicable law.
The kinds of personal information that we collect depend on the types of products and Services you use. We
collect
personal information directly from you, such as:
Registration and account set up data: When you sign up to use our Services, you may provide us
with
your name (first and last), email address, date of birth (month/date), and a password to access your CafePress
account. We use this information to create your CafePress account, where all of your content, creations, and
other
activities are stored. We also use this information to help verify your identity, account and account activities
to
ensure the safety and security of your transactions. We use your date of birth to provide you discounts and
other
Services that may be of interest to you on your birthday.
Profile data: When you sign up for a CafePress account, you may choose to create an account
profile. When you choose
to do so, we collect your name, username (if different than your name or email address), your photo or other
image,
your location (country and city), a link to your social media handle (e.g., via Facebook, Pinterest, or others),
and
any information about yourself that you choose to provide. The name associated with your account is publicly
displayed and connected to your CafePress account activity.
If you choose to make your profile public, people may see your name, the country you designate in your profile,
and
your “About” details for your shop. You can adjust the privacy settings to your profile at any time.
Payment details when you complete a purchase: When you complete or authorize a purchase or
similar
transaction, we
will ask for your email address, payment information, including a credit or debit card number, credit
verification
code (“CVV”), name (first and last), an expiration date for your credit or debit card, shipping and billing
information. We may also ask you to provide your phone number.
We use third-party payment processing companies to process your payment information. This information is used to
fulfill your order, and to make your shopping experience easy and efficient. Specifically, we display your
delivery
and billing address(es) to you during the order process so you can confirm they are correct. We also use your
delivery and billing address for address verification, and include them on our invoices to assist our production
partners with the shipping and handling of your order. We may print your phone number on the shipping label of
your
package so that the courier may contact you in the event there’s a difficulty delivering your package.
We store your shipping and billing addresses, so you won’t have to input them every time you make a purchase.
CafePress does NOT store your full credit card number or CVV.
Payment details when you sell products: If you choose to sell products on CafePress’ Site –
whether
on our marketplace or when you open a shop – we collect information such as your shop name, billing and payment
information including your name (first and last), physical address, country of residence, phone number, your
payment
preference (e.g., via PayPal or mailing address), and date of birth in order to verify your identity, provide
this
service to you and comply with applicable law. If you choose to receive a commission on your sales, we also
require
your Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number (if receiving payment as an individual) or business
name
and Tax Identification Numbers (if receiving payment as a business) in order to verify your identity and comply
with
applicable law.
Contact information: When you contact us, we may collect your name (first and last), email
address,
or telephone
number, order or product numbers (if any), store IDs/member numbers, and any other personal information you
voluntarily provide. We use your contact information to send you newsletters, share news about new products,
features, and Services, respond to your requests and inquiries, or reach out to you about issues and questions
about
your account.
Your photos or images: When you upload content or create products using the Services, we may
collect the images that you upload. You may include image titles, and captions, and the date and time of upload.
Community postings: You can post information in CafePress blogs, forums, or other public
posting
areas. Any information you disclose is available to anyone with internet access. You do not have to use these
features, but if you do, please use common sense and good judgment when posting in these community spaces or
sharing
your personal information with others through the Services.
BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING INFORMATION IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. BE AWARE THAT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION
THAT YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT THERE CAN BE READ, COLLECTED, OR USED BY OTHERS, OR COULD BE USED TO SEND UNSOLICITED
MESSAGES TO YOU. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHERS’ USE OF INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHAT ROOMS AND FORUMS. ANY INFORMATION YOU DON’T WANT OTHERS TO KNOW SHOULD NOT
BE
POSTED PUBLICLY.
CafePress reserves the right to remove content or other postings from community spaces for any reason, but we
generally
do not do so, and your posts may remain public after your account is closed. You are responsible for the
personal information that you choose to post in community spaces through the Services.
Another CafePress member may follow your public activity on the Site, such as when you add an item to your
public
Favorites. You may choose to make certain activities private through your account settings.
Information you provide to us when completing our surveys: If you choose to complete any of our
surveys, you may
share your name, email address, age, gender, answers to our surveys or comments and other information you choose
to
provide us in the comment fields. Our surveys are designed to collect your feedback in order for us to
continually
improve our Services. Participation in our surveys is completely voluntary. You choose whether to participate,
and
what to disclose. If you participate in a survey, your responses may be shared with third-parties we hire to
conduct
our surveys. We also may contact you for additional information needed to solve any issue you identify in your
survey responses. We may also contact you in response to your request for help.
Employment information (job applicants): When you apply for a position with us, we also collect
information about
you including your name, address, resume/CV, educational details, prior experience and qualifications and any
other
information you choose to provide. CafePress is an equal opportunity employer.
1.2. Personal information we collect about you from others.

personal information (phone numbers and email addresses) when someone invites you visit the Site or a CafePress
member uploads your photo or other images.
We may receive information about you and your interaction with the Services from our third-party business
partners,

Legitimate business reasons: We process personal information described above when we have

Information about collection, sale or disclosure: You have the right to be informed of the categories
of
personal information that we collect about you in the preceding (12) months, including the categories of
sources
from which the personal information was collected, the business or commercial purposes for which the
personal
information is used, disclosed, or sold, and the categories of third parties with whom we share the personal
information, as also set forth in this Notice.
Access to specific information: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to
you
about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. The information
that
we will provide to you will be masked, meaning that portions of it will be omitted so that it can’t be used
fraudulently. For example, your telephone number may display as (123)-XXX-4567. Once we have verified your
identity, we will disclose the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you, which will be
made in writing and delivered through your account with us, if you maintain such an account.
Deletion request rights: You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
information
that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that if you delete your
personal information, some of our Services may not work the same.
Exceptions: We may not be able to fulfill your request if we (or our service providers) are required to
retain
your personal information for one or more of the following reasons:
Transactional: to complete a transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a
good or
service requested by you, or perform a contract we have with you;
Security: to detect data security incidents;
Error Correction: to debug or repair any errors
Legal: to protect against fraud or illegal activity or to comply with applicable law or a legal
obligation,
or exercise rights under the law, such as the right to free speech; or
Internal Use: to use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with
the
context in which you provided the information (i.e. to improve our services).
Right to opt out of sale of Personal Information: You have the right to opt out of the sale of your
personal information, as defined in the CCPA. The term “sale” is defined broadly under the California Consumer
Privacy Act. To the extent that “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include interest-based advertising or
other data uses described in the “Cookies and Other Technologies” Section above, we will comply with applicable
law as to those activities. You can read more in our Cookies Notice.
To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, you can exercise your choice by using your device’s or
browser’s privacy settings.
Non-discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights under
CCPA or applicable law, including by, denying you goods or services, charging you different prices or rates for
goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties, providing you
a different level of quality of goods or services, or suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate
for goods or services or a different level of quality of goods or services.
11.5. Exercising your consumer rights
To exercise your rights, you can:
Call us at 1-844-988-0030 Toll-Free (US & Canada).
Email us at privacy@cafepress.com. When you email us,
Include “My California Rights” in the subject of the email
Please include sufficient personal information for us to locate your records and to verify the
identity
affiliated with your account. At a minimum, you must provide the full name and email address
affiliated
with your account. We may request additional information, such as your telephone number, member
number,
billing address if you have made a purchase with us, telephone number, or information regarding your
order history, to complete the verification process if we are unable to verify your identity. Our
ability to locate your personal information is limited by the accuracy and the completeness of the
information that you provide.
Submit a request here.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
or
authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal
information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to
make
the request. You may receive follow-up communications from us requesting additional information that will
help
us match your identity with the information we maintain about you. For example, if there is a discrepancy
between the information in our systems and the information you provided with your request, we may ask that
you
submit additional information to validate your identity such as your order history or other contact
information
(e.g., e-mail address, telephone number, billing address) you may have used to order products or use our
services.
You may also exercise your rights via an authorized agent (“Authorized Agent”). An Authorized Agent can be a
third party that you authorize to act on your behalf, such as a third party with power of attorney. If you
are a
resident of California, an Authorized Agent can only be a person or a business entity that you authorize to
act
on your behalf to submit a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
When an Authorized Agent is submitting a request on your behalf, we will require your Authorized Agent to
provide evidence of their entitlement, which must include information sufficient to identify you and the
purpose
of the request, and at least one of the following:
written and signed permission designating the Authorized Agent to act on your behalf. You must verify
your
identity with us and directly confirm with us that you have provided the Authorized Agent permission to
submit the request;
evidence that you have provided the Authorized Agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California
Probate Code; or
proof that the Authorized Agent is registered with the California Secretary of State and that you have
authorized be able to act on your behalf.
Absent such documentation, we reserve the right to refuse to comply with third-party requests for
information.
11.6. California Shine the Light
Under California Civil Code section 1798.83, California residents who have an established business
relationship
with us are entitled to ask us for a notice describing the types of personal customer information we have
shared
with third parties for those parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. That
notice
will identify the categories of information shared with third parties, the names and addresses of those
third
parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties.
If you are a California resident and would like to request a copy of this notice or exercise your rights
under
the CCPA, please contact us as set forth in Section 16.

13. DO WE TRANSFER PERSONAL INFORMATION INTERNATIONALLY
The personal information and other information that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored
in
the United States. It also may be processed by staff operating outside the EU/EEA who work for us or other
entities acting as data processors processing data on our behalf. This includes staff and providers engaged
in,
among other things, the fulfillment of your request or order and the provision of support services. More
information on to whom your data is disclosed can be found in Section 5.
>
Your Consent to International Transfer of Personal Information
If you are located in the EU/EEA or Switzerland we may also process, store, and/or transfer personal information we collect about you, in and to a country outside the EU/EEA or Switzerland including the United States. Those other countries may have different privacy laws that may or may not be as comprehensive as your own.
By submitting personal information or engaging with our Sites, Apps and/or Services, you consent to this transfer, storing, and/or processing.
Notice Re: EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Status and CJEU Schrems II Ruling
On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice determined that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework is no longer valid for the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. (known as the Schrems II decision). The Schrems II decision also placed additional compliance requirements on the use of EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for transfer of EU/EEA personal information to the U.S. by companies subject to Section 702 of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and/or Executive Order 12333 (E.O. 12333).
We know our customers, website visitors, and business partners care deeply about privacy and data security; and we optimize our work to get these issues right. We’d like to confirm that you can continue to use our Sites, Apps, products and Services regarding EU/EEA and Swiss personal information in compliance with EU and Swiss law.
First, please know that it is our good faith belief that the types of EU/EEA/Swiss personal information we receive, collect, process, use and/or share in the U.S. are not of the types of personal information that would generally be subject to requests from U.S. government authorities pursuant to FISA Section 702 and/or E.O. 12333.
Second, please note that as part of our good faith efforts to comply with applicable data security laws that we strive to store and process EU, EEA, and Swiss personal information in Ireland, on servers located in the EU.
In compliance with the GDPR and other applicable laws we also implement data encryption, data minimization, data pseudonymization, and need to know access to personal information.
Third, we are continuing to comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles required by our EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Certifications regarding personal information processed by us under those Certifications.
More information about our collection, use and/or sharing of EU/EEA/Swiss personal information and our compliance with applicable laws is located in this Privacy Notice above.
Fourth, when applicable we require our service providers and business partners to enter into EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC), as amended, for compliance with EU/EEA/Swiss data protection laws.
If an international transfer of personal information cannot be based on SCC, our transfer to a third country may also be necessary in order to perform a contract with you or in individual cases for the purposes of our compelling legitimate business interests and in order to comply with our internal policy, contractual and legal obligations.
If you represent one of our service providers or business partners and your organization is a party to an agreement with us that includes EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for compliance with EU/EEA/Swiss data protection laws, please contact us at GDPR@cafepress.com to discuss whether any updates to our agreement are needed resulting from the Schrems II decision.
Trust is a top priority for us, and we will continue to work vigilantly to ensure that our customers, website visitors, and business partners are able to continue to enjoy the benefits of our Sites, Apps, products and Services securely, compliantly, and without disruption.
As always if you have questions or concerns about our collection and/or use of personal information, please contact us at GDPR@cafepress.com or through your account. Here is more information about how CafePress continues to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and
With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks,
CafePress is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other
than
our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently
authorized. To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to
GDPR@cafepress.com.
CafePress’ accountability for personal information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and
subsequently
transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, CafePress remains
responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process
the
personal information on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless CafePress
proves
that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, CafePress commits to resolve complaints about your privacy
and
our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy
Shield.
European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact
CafePress
at GDPR@cafepress.com.
CafePress has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an
independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business
Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not
satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers
for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you
may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy
Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.
