Eckler's Automotive Privacy Statement
Last Updated May 25, 2018
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices. Please read this privacy statement closely. You accept the terms of this private statement by continuing to use Eckler's Automotive’s products and services.
Policy
Eckler's Automotive, Inc., will never sell, rent, barter, trade, distribute or lease personal information to outside parties unless Eckler's Automotive obtains customer permission or disclosure is required by law.
Purpose
Eckler's Automotive uses the information customers provide only to the extent necessary to offer our services to our customers. Eckler's Automotive believes in both minimizing the data that is collected and limiting its use and purpose to only that:
for which we have been given permission by customers
as necessary to deliver our services, and
as we might be required or permitted for legal, compliance or other lawful purposes.
The only individually identifiable information that Eckler's Automotive collects about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration, such as your name, billing address, email address, phone, usernames and passwords. This information will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only. Eckler's Automotive uses return email addresses to answer the email Eckler's Automotive receives. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. Eckler's Automotive will never willfully release your personal information to any third party unless you direct us to do so or disclosure is required by law.
Eckler's Automotive also may collect personal information when you request assistance from our customer support team (e.g., phone number, email address,) and may collect additional information that you choose to share with our customer support team.
Eckler's Automotive also collects information to evaluate aggregate site usage. Eckler's Automotive may automatically collect certain usage information from customers, such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our services and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies as noted below. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services. We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into their Eckler's Automotive databases as part of our log-in process and for enhanced identity authentication and authorization security.
Eckler's Automotive’s services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.
Cookies
There is a technology called “cookies” which can be used to provide tailored information from a web site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. A “cookie” marks and identifies visitors on an Internet site to allow customers to enter customized information and have it available on subsequent visits. Eckler's Automotive pages may use cookies so that Eckler's Automotive can provide a customer with access to information when a customer returns to Eckler's Automotive web site.
Although there has been debate over the privacy implications of cookies, it is important for Eckler's Automotive customers to know that cookies do not read your hard drive, nor can cookies be used to reveal new information about you that you have not elected to reveal. Eckler's Automotive may use cookies to log your activity on the site. Everything Eckler's Automotive learns from these logs will be used to enrich our users’ experiences on our site. It will help Eckler's Automotive understand what you like and don’t like, so Eckler's Automotive can focus its energies more effectively and provide you with better service. Please note that your web browser settings may be adjusted to limit or prohibit this and other websites from placing cookies.
Our site uses a third party service to match browser cookies to your mailing address. We then use another company to send special offers through the mail on our behalf. Our company never receives or stores any of this information and our third parties do not provide or sell this information to any other company or service.
Security
Eckler's Automotive is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.

If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
Connecting or Linking Your Eckler's Automotive Database with Third Party Services
We work with other companies or developers who provide products and services that you may choose to sync, link or otherwise connect with your Eckler's Automotive database. If you choose to make use of such related products or services, we may exchange that information, including your personal information, information from your database, and information about how you interact with each company’s service or product with one or more third parties. This routine exchange of information is necessary to maintain business operations and to provide the requested services.
