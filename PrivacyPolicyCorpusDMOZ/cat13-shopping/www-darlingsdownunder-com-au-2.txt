Postage
We use Australia Post and a Courier service as our methods of delivery. ALL parcels sent by Darlings Downunder are trackable, for your peace of mind, and to ensure safe delivery of your fluffy mail!
We have a FLAT rate $9.95 for trackable delivery within Australia. Your order will be sent by either Courier or trackable Australia Post at our discretion.
Alternatively, you can select Express Post (Australia Post) for $14.95 Australia wide.
We always endeavour to have your parcel sent the next business day after your payment clears. Australia Post and our courier usually take between 2-7 business days to deliver depending on where you reside.
When your parcel is on its way, you will receive an email notification and the tracking number of your parcel.
PLEASE NOTE: Once a parcel is in the care of Australia Post or our courier, it becomes their responsibility. Darlings Downunder take no responsibility for lost or missing items or items
damaged in transit. We are not obliged to replace lost or damaged items, though we will do what we can to track them down.
NEW ZEALAND customers: Please checkout using the "New Zealand" postage option. We offer a flat postage rate of $35 to NZ via Airmail only. If you would like signature on delivery we can send your parcel Express Post International, but actual postage charges will apply. Customers outside Australia do not need to be charged our 10% GST (goods and services tax). Customs/Imports duties (if any) will be your responsibility. Please feel welcome to email us if you have any questions or would like a quote, etc.
OTHER COUNTRIES: Please contact us first as some items we stock are unable to be shipped overseas due to distribution agreements and there are some countries we are unable to ship to. If we are able to send an order to you, we will need to discuss it with you to ensure accurate postage prices (we charge actual postage prices for overseas deliveries) and to receive a discount from our listed prices (included in our pricing is a 10% Goods and Services Tax applicable only to Australian sales). We can assist you in putting through your order and quote you postage costs. Any customs or import duty applied by your country of residence will be your responsibility.
Please email us with any further queries on delivery.
Payment
We accept payments via credit card (Visa or Mastercard via eWay), direct deposit, cheque (all cheques must clear before goods are sent), Australia Post money order, layby, and ZipPay. When you select the Direct Deposit option at checkout our confirmation email will show the necessary details to make this arrangement. We endeavour to send orders out the next business day following cleared payment.
We use eWay - a secure, Australian, PCI DSS compliant credit card facility - to process our credit card payments. They secure customer and credit card data using military–grade software
and it's encrypted by Ingrian devices to offer the highest level of
protection possible. eWay are tier one PCI DSS compliant, meaning they
adhere to the highest security standards set by Visa and MasterCard.
Paypal is also available on request, please email us for details.
In order to ensure our customers the best possible prices, we are strictly prepaid only. Darlings Downunder does not offer credit terms or run accounts. Goods are only dispatched upon receipt of full payment.
Order Changes
Darlings Downunder process your orders very quickly so that you can receive your 'Fluffy Mail' as soon as possible, so please try not to make any changes to your order as this will delay the despatch times!
