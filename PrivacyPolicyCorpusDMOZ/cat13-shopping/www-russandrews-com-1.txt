Terms & Conditions
1 The contract between us
When you place an order to purchase a product from our website, we will send you one or more e-mails to the e-mail address you provided confirming receipt of your order and containing details of the order. Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a product which is accepted by us when we send an email to you confirming that your order has been despatched. We must receive payment details for the whole price for the goods that you order before your order can be despatched. We will not charge your card until your order is ready to be despatched and the title of all goods will not pass to you until we have received payment.
Any products on the same order which we have not been confirmed in a despatch confirmation email to you do not form part of that contract to you.
2 Price
2.1 The prices payable for goods that you order are as set out in our website but may be subject to change without notification.
2.2 If you live outside UK mainland then you will be required to pay extra for delivery and it might not be possible for us to deliver to some locations. Our delivery charges are calculated for you in the 'Shopping Basket'.
3 60 Day Home Trial and cancelling your order
3.1 Try our products in your own system, in your own home. If you decide they are not for you, then simply return them within 60 days, in original condition, for a full refund. Non standard cable lengths (any length not listed on our website) and custom made products are excluded from our Home Trial.
3.2 You may cancel your order at any time up to the end of the sixtieth day from the date you receive the ordered goods. You do not need to give us any reason for cancelling your order nor will you have to pay any penalty. Please be aware that you may not be able to cancel an order for non standard cable lengths (any length not listed on our website) or products that have been custom made for you (eg Torlyte speaker stands) if we have made them or are in the process of making them.
3.4 To cancel your order you must notify us in writing (letter, fax or e-mail).
3.5 For full information on how to return products under our 60 Day Home Trial, please click here.
3.6 Once you have returned products to us under the 60 Day Home Trial, any sum debited to us from your credit card will be re-credited to your account as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of your order provided that the goods are received by us in the condition they were in when delivered to you. If you do not pay the costs of delivery, we shall be entitled to deduct the direct costs of recovering the goods from the amount to be re-credited to you.
4 If we cancel your order
4.1 We reserve the right to cancel your order if:
4.1.1 we have insufficient stock to deliver the goods you have ordered;
4.1.2 we do not deliver to your area; or
4.1.3 one or more of the goods you ordered was listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or an error in the pricing information received by us from our suppliers.
4.2 If we do cancel your order we will notify you in writing (by letter, e-mail or fax) and will re-credit to your account any sum deducted by us from your credit card as soon as possible but in any event within 30 days of your order. We will not be obliged to offer any additional compensation for disappointment suffered.
5 Delivery of goods to you
5.1 We will deliver the goods ordered by you to the address you give us for delivery at the time you make your order.
5.2 Delivery will be made as soon as possible after you order is accepted and normally within 30 days of your order. Non standard cable lengths and custom made products may take longer, we will notify you of an estimated delivery time when we have processed your order.
5.3 You will become the owner of the goods you have ordered when they have been delivered to you. Once goods have been delivered to you they will be held at your own risk and we will not be liable for their loss or destruction.
6 Liability
6.1 If the goods we deliver are not what you ordered or are damaged or defective or the delivery is of an incorrect quantity, we shall have no liability to you unless you notify us in writing at our contact address of the problem within 10 working days of the delivery of the goods in question.
6.2 If you do not receive goods ordered by you within 30 days of the date on which you ordered them, we shall have no liability to you unless you notify us in writing at our contact address of the problem within 40 days of the date on which you ordered the goods.
If you notify a problem to us under this condition, our only obligation will be, at your option:

6.2.3 to refund to you the amount paid by you for the goods in question in whatever way we choose.
