Shipments to the Contiguous 48 US States
Orders $69 and over qualify for our free ground shipping offer.
We understand you want your order as quickly as possible. We work closely with our suppliers to have products shipped directly to you from their warehouse.
Items will be marked as in-store or drop-ship on the product page. Products marked as in-store will be shipped from our retail location in Tacoma, Washington, while products marked as drop-ship will be shipped from our suppliers.  Most products will be marked "In-store” will ship within 1 business day. All orders are expected to ship by the next business day.
In some cases, orders with multiple items may be shipped from different locations.  You will likely be contacted to inform you of this. We use our best judgment to get the products to you as quickly as possible but will contact you for approval before any changes are made.
Tracking information will be sent by email typically within 24 hours of an item shipping. Most orders will be shipped UPS; however, we do utilize additional shipping carriers such as USPS, and FedEx.
Shipping Method Explanation
Business days are Monday-Friday; Holidays, Saturday and Sunday are not business days. Shipping timelines are estimates and are not guaranteed. Please refer to your tracking information or contact us for an accurate location of your order.

Delivered by the end of the 2nd business days after the order has shipped.
Three Day
Delivery by the end of the third business day after an order has shipped. A good example is, an order placed on a Tuesday night is processed/shipped on Wednesday, would arrive on Monday the following week.
Next Day
Delivery the next business day after an order has shipped. Orders that ship out on Tuesday with Next-Day delivery is scheduled to be delivered on Wednesday, while an order shipped out on Friday with Next Day delivery is scheduled to arrive on Monday.
Shipping Changes
If a shipment needs to be intercepted, and address changed, or a will-call pick-up may be assessed a $15 service fee per shipment.  This fee is the fee charged to Eagle Leather to make that change by the shipping carrier when the package is in transit.
Order Cancellation
Because some orders are drop-shipped from our suppliers if you change your mind act quickly.  We will do our best to stop the order before it is processed but may not always be able to.  If we are unable to stop the order, we will contact you with what to do next.
PO Boxes
Private shipping companies or carriers, such as UPS, FedEx, and Amazon, are not able to deliver to (place mail-in) a PO Box. Only the United States Postal Service® is permitted to deliver mail to (place mail-in) a PO Box.
For mailing purposes, PO Boxes are considered a physical location. If a mailpiece that is addressed to a PO Box must be signed for or is too large to fit in the box, the Post Office™ will place in your box either:
A key to a larger storage locker within the same facility (for a larger item)
A notice that you can take to a window clerk to collect your item(s) – Redelivery is not permitted since you have to collect the item from a window clerk.
APO
Each shipment to an APO/FPO/DPO needs the recipient's name and rank, their unit, and the APO/FPO/DPO address with the 9-digit ZIP Code. And always make sure to include a return address. Mail and shipments must be addressed to someone specific as addressing to "Any Service Member" is no longer permitted.
APO orders will be shipped via USPS and may take an additional 1-5 business days to process your order.

Orders shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands will ship via the United States Postal Service. Please allow an additional 1-5 business days to process your order. If your order is urgent, feel free to contact us and we can try to accommodate.
