What Information About You Is Shared and With Whom?
We may share some or all of your personal information with VF Corporation
subsidiaries which operate under the following brand names: Altra®,
Bulwark®, Dickies®, Eagle Creek®, Eastpak®, Horace Small®, Icebreaker®,
JanSport®, Kipling®, Kodiak®, Liberty®, MakeIt Movement®, Napapijri®, Red
Kap®, Smartwool®, Terra®, The North Face®, Timberland®, Vans®, VF
Solutions®, Walls®, and Workrite®.
We may also share your personal information with service providers who
provide services to us or conduct activities on our behalf. When we share
your personal information with our service providers, we instruct them to
limit their use and further sharing of your personal information so that
they only use or share your personal information for the intended purposes
and we further instruct them not to sell your personal information. One
example of our information sharing with a service provider is when we
share your name, address, and similar contact information with a courier
service for the purpose of delivering a product to you and notifying you
of the status of the shipment. We may also share your information with a
third party who is not a service provider and who is not acting on our
behalf, and from whom we do not receive compensation, such as our auditing
firm.
The categories of information that we may share with a third party
(including service providers) for a business purposes, or have shared
during the preceding twelve (12) months, includes the following: name,
nickname, physical or mailing address, unique personal identifier, online
identifier/screenname, IP address, email address, account name, driver’s
license number, signature, physical characteristics or biometric
information (such as size, height, weight or other information relevant to
your footwear and apparel preferences), telephone number, bank account
number, credit card number, debit card number, other payment information,
sex or gender, age, products or services purchased or considered,
purchasing histories or tendencies, Internet activity (such as browsing
history, search history, clicks, etc.), location data, audio, electronic,
visual, thermal, or olfactory information, preferences, behavior, and
social media information. We share these categories of information for the
same purposes we collect and use them, as described above under the
caption “Why Your Information Is Collected and Used.”
We do not sell consumers’ personal information, regardless of their age,
and we have not sold consumers’ personal information in the twelve (12)
months prior to the date of this Privacy Statement. We do, however,
maintain a list of consumers who have notified us that they do not wish
for their personal information to be sold. One reason we maintain such a
list is because, in the future, we may sell or otherwise divest a brand or
business unit, including the customer data associated with that brand or
unit, to a company whose privacy policies are different from ours, and we
would like to convey the wishes of those consumers to the buyer. To
request that your personal information not be sold, please follow this
hyperlink:
Do Not Sell My Personal Information.
How Can I Opt Out of Online Advertising Or Other Promotional
Communications?
Our websites may use cookies or similar technologies to understand more
about your interaction with our websites. Our websites currently do not
have a mechanism to recognize your Internet browser’s “Do Not Track”
signals, but several of the third-party companies who utilize these
cookies or other tracking or monitoring mechanisms enable you to opt out
of this advertising through mechanisms established by trade groups, as
follows: If you wish to reduce this type of third-party interest-based
advertising, you may opt out of advertising from members of the National
Advertising Initiative
here, and from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance
here. Please note
this does not opt you out of receiving all marketing communications from
us. There are other ways in which you can tell us whether or not you want
to receive promotional communications from us. When you set-up an account
or log into your account on our brands’ websites or mobile applications,
you may have an opportunity to make or change your selections with respect
to each brand. You also will have an opportunity to opt-out of advertising
email messages from us by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained
in commercial e-mails those brands send you. If you receive a text message
(SMS or MMS) from one of our brands and would like to opt out of receiving
further text messages, you may do so by following the opt-out instructions
within (or linked from) the text message.
What About the Privacy of Children?
We do not intend to collect personal information from anyone who is under
the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13 you should not provide any
personal information to us. If you are a parent or guardian of a child
under the age of 13 and suspect he/she has provided personal information
to us, you may contact us using one of the Communication Methods described
in this Privacy Statement to exercise your rights as a parent or guardian.
Because we do not sell personal information, we do not sell the personal
information of consumers under 16 years of age.
What Happens When I Click A Link To Another Web Site?
Our websites and mobile applications may contain links to third-party
websites to which this Privacy Statement does not apply ("Linked
Websites"). Your use of Linked Websites will be governed by the terms of
use, privacy policies, and other terms, notices, and policies set forth on
or referenced in those Linked Websites.
What If I Am an International User?
This Privacy Statement describes our policies and procedures in the United
States. Regardless of where you live, by using our U.S. website or
engaging with us while within the U.S., you consent to have your personal
data transferred, processed, and stored in the United States, and allow us
to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this
Privacy Statement. If you live outside the U.S., we may host a website or
application designed for use in your jurisdiction, and we encourage you to
use that website or application.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
This section of our Privacy Statement applies solely to consumers who
reside in the State of California.
Your Options Regarding Information About You, and How To Exercise Your
Options
Under California law, you have specific rights regarding your personal
information. We want to respect your wishes, and we have established
processes by which you can exercise your options regarding your personal
information. To exercise your options as described in this Privacy
Statement, you may contact us in one of four ways:
by telephone at +1-877-709-1800;
by completing the web form at https://www.VFC.com/US-Privacy-Requests;
by mail at: VF Corporation, Attn: VF North America Privacy Program
Office, 105 Corporate Center Blvd., Greensboro, North Carolina, USA
27408; or
in person at one of our retail stores in California.
Collectively, these are referred to as the “Communication Methods”. To
effectively exercise your privacy options, you must use one of these
Communication Methods.
The list below describes the types of requests you may make to us
regarding information we have collected from you:
Request to Know: You may ask us to furnish you with (i) the
categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected
about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which we collect
information about you; (iii) the business or commercial purposes for
collecting information about you; and (iv) the categories of third
parties with whom we share personal information about you (or have
shared in the prior 12 months).
Request to Delete: You may ask us to delete any personal
information that we have collected from you and to direct our service
providers to delete your personal information from their records. After
verifying your request, we will comply as further described below,
unless we determine that there is a lawful basis for retaining the
information, including because the information is necessary to: (i)
complete a transaction or perform a contract between us; (ii) ensure
security; (iii) debug or repair errors; (iv) exercise a legal right; (v)
comply with another law or a legal obligation; (vi) conduct research;
(vii) enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with our
consumer’s reasonable expectations; (viii) otherwise use the
information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the
context in which you provided the information.
Opt-Out of Sale: You may request that we not sell your personal
information, if you wish, and we will honor your request. You may make
such a request by following this link:
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request
within 45 days; however, we may notify you during the initial 45-day
period that we will extend the timeframe by up to 45 additional days, if
an extension is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill your request. We
will fulfill the same Request to Know from you up to two times in any
twelve-month period, but we are not able to fulfill redundant Requests to
Know more frequently than that. We will not discriminate against you
because you have made a request described in this Privacy Statement or
otherwise exercised your rights under applicable law. We may offer
financial incentives or offer you a different price, level, or quality of
goods or services in connection with programs that require you to disclose
certain personal information, but only if you opt in to such an incentive
program. If you opt in to any such incentive program, you make revoke your
consent to share your personal information at any time, as described in
the terms and conditions of those programs.
In addition, California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers who are
California residents to request certain information regarding our
disclosure of personal information to third parties for the third parties’
own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us
using one of the Communication Methods described in this Privacy
Statement, describing your request specifically.
How Will You Verify My Identity?
For your privacy and security, and to prevent fraud and other harmful
activities, when we receive a request through one of the Communication
Methods, we need to ensure that the person submitting the request is the
person they purport to be. Accordingly, we may take reasonable measures to
verify the identity of the person submitting the request. . Initially, we
ask you to provide personal information when you submit a request, whether
through our web form, toll-free telephone number, mail, or other approved
Communication Method. This information will include your first name,
middle name, last name, email address, shipping address and telephone
number. Providing accurate information that matches our records is
necessary so that we can locate the correct information within our systems
and service providers, verify the validity of the request, and protect
your data. To verify your request, may ask you to submit evidence proving
your identity. You may submit this information simultaneously with your
request (by mail or by using our interactive web form) or after your
request. The evidence we may request from you, and the degree of certainty
we will be required to reach regarding your identity and the authenticity
of your request, will depend upon the nature of your request, the nature
of the information we have about you, and your ability to furnish
information. For requests of specific pieces of personal information about
a consumer, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of
certainty; whereas for requests to know the categories of personal
information collected and used about a consumer, we will verify identity
to a reasonable degree of certainty. We may give you options, such as (i)
submitting a signed statement and a redacted copy of identifying
information (such as a government-issued ID), or (ii) showing your
identifying information to our associate at one of our California retail
locations.
Personal Information Collected Directly From Consumers
We really want to know and understand you so that we can give you an
excellent customer experience. The categories of information that we have
collected directly from consumers during the preceding 12 months include
the following: name, nickname/alias, physical or mailing address, unique
personal identifier, online identifier/screenname, IP address, email
address, account name, driver’s license number, signature, physical
characteristics or biometric information (such as size, height, weight or
other information relevant to your footwear and apparel preferences),
telephone number, bank account number, credit card number, debit card
number, other payment information, sex or gender, age, products or
services purchased or considered, purchasing histories or tendencies,
Internet activity (e.g., browsing history, search history, clicks),
location data, audio, electronic, visual, thermal, or olfactory
information, preferences, behavior, and social media information.
If we ask you to verify your identity, you must promptly cooperate with
our efforts so that we can fulfill your request. If you do not comply,
your request cannot be fulfilled; and if you delay in complying, the
fulfillment of your request is likely to be delayed, and may be denied, as
