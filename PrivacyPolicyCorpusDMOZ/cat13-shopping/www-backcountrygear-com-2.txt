Return Policy
Return Policy
Please note, returns are taking longer than normal to process since most of our office staff is working from home due to COVID-19 precautions. Please contact customer service if you have questions about your return.
As long as you return the item unused, clean, and smelling new, we will accept returns within 60 days of purchase and we will gladly exchange, credit or refund the cost of the item. Products must be returned with all original tags and/or packaging for a full refund.
Sorry, we will not reimburse shipping charges. Please note that items smelling of cigarette smoke are not considered resalable and are not eligible for a full refund.
To arrange a return or exchange, you can obtain a Return Authorization (RA) number by using one of the following methods:
Call us at 1-800-953-5499 Ext 4
Press The Live Chat Button (lower right on our web page)
Email us at returns@backcountrygear.com (please provide Name, Order number, the item(s) you wish to return and a brief reason for the return)
To protect our customers, hydration packs may only be returned if they have never been filled and the protective mouthpiece cover has not been removed. Bottles and liquid containers may not be returned.
We do not accept returns or exchanges on the Outdoor Research Essential Face Mask Kit or Essential Face Mask Filter 3 Pack.
If a product fails due to a manufacturer's error, the manufacturer's warranty will apply. Contact us and we will help you get your gear returned to the manufacturer for repair.
Climbing Equipment Return Policy
For liability reasons and your personal safety, we cannot accept returns on any climbing hardware, ropes or slings at any time (excluding warranty situations or shipping errors). Please be absolutely sure of the items you are purchasing before submitting your order. Backcountry Gear will only accept returns on harnesses and shoes if tried on but never used. If you tie in, it's yours. Helmets may also be exchanged for fit and sizing. Helmets, harnesses, and shoes must be returned in new condition with all tags and packaging. In the case of gifts, if there is any doubt, we recommend a gift certificate instead of purchasing climbing equipment.
