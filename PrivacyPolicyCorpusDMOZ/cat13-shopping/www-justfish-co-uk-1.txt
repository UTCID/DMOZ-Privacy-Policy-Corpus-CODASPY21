Glasgow Angling Centre Reward Card Scheme
Terms and Conditions
These Terms and Conditions (and the GAC Privacy Policy) form a contract between Glasgow Angling Centre Ltd ('GAC') and you, the 'Card Holder', in relation to how reward points are earned and spent in the GAC Reward Card programme.
The GAC rewards programme has previously been trialled with a small group of users and with effect from September 1st 2011 is in beta test phase, with a much wider group of users invited to participate. Eligible Participants will receive Reward Points (as defined below) based on a percentage of their Qualifying Spend and will have an opportunity to redeem earned Reward Points in accordance with the following Terms and Conditions. The Programme Period covered by these Terms and Conditions starts at 00:00:01 UK time September 1st 2011 and will continue for a period of 24 months or until terminated by GAC in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. In the case of the scheme being terminated, any reward points left on customer accounts will be issued as a voucher which can be redeemed against goods within 90 days of the termination date.
The GAC Reward Card programme is open to any person who applies for a Reward Card at a GAC store in the UK or Republic of Ireland or online at www.fishingmegastore.com. GAC may extend the Reward Card programme in its discretion at any time. If you apply for a Reward Card you confirm that you accept these Terms and Conditions. GAC may refuse an application for a Reward Card if it has good reason to do so.
If you apply for a Reward Card in a GAC store you will need to provide one of the GAC sales team with your title, forename, surname, telephone number and address. If you apply for a Reward Card online, you will need to create a GAC account and you will be required to input the same information together with a valid email address.
An administration fee of £5 is charged on an application for a GAC Reward Card. This fee may be waived at GAC's discretion.
Card Holders may apply for additional Reward Cards on their accounts to be used by other members of the Card Holder's household. Additional Reward Cards will be issued at the discretion of GAC and will be charged for at a cost of £1 per card. Household members issued with additional Reward Cards may earn and redeem points on the original Card Holder's GAC account (subject to these Terms and Conditions).
Reward Cards are issued by and remain the property of GAC. If requested, Card Holders are required to return their Reward Card to GAC or to destroy them.
Card Holders are responsible for the security of their Reward Cards and for any points earned or redeemed ('spent') using it. Card Holders are also responsible for the actions of additional card holders from their household. If a Reward Card is lost, stolen or damaged or a person has gained unauthorised access to your Reward Card, Card Holders should notify GAC immediately, either online, via Customer Services or through one of the team at a GAC store, so that a replacement card and account number can be arranged. Replacement cards will be charged at a cost of £1 per card.
Reward Cards cannot be used as credit cards or guarantee cards.
Card Holders earn reward points on purchases in GAC stores or online. To earn points in a GAC store, the Card Holder must present their Reward Card to a member of the GAC sales team at the till at the beginning of the transaction. To earn points online, you must login to your account at the checkout on the website. Once logged in your GAC account points are automatically credited to your Reward Card when you complete a qualifying purchase. Card Holders can only link one Reward Card to each GAC account.
Reward points will only be added at the time of purchase and cannot be added at a later date. It usually takes up to 24 hours for points to be added to a Reward Card account. Reward points cannot be earned on purchases made prior to joining the GAC Reward Card programme.
Points are awarded on every purchase over £1.00, except on the purchase of Gift Vouchers. Other products may be included or excluded at the discretion of GAC. Double reward points are awarded on the purchase of Fisheagle and Stillwater branded goods.
Card Holders will receive points on qualifying purchases calculated at the rate of 1 point for every £0.10 spent (rounded up to the nearest whole number, so, for example a purchase for £19.91 earns 200 points and a purchase for £20.01 earns 201 points).
GAC reserves the right to vary the rate at which reward points are earned (including offering bonus points from time to time) on providing you with reasonable notice.
Card Holders can redeem reward points against purchases in GAC stores or online at a value of £2.50 per 1,000 points. Card Holders can only redeem points in multiples of 1,000 points. No change or credit will be given for any overpayment using points. GAC reserves the right to vary the number of points required to be redeemed against a purchase or to exclude certain products from the GAC Reward Card programme.
Points cannot be redeemed until registered on a Card Holder's Reward Card. Note that as stated above, it takes around 24 hours for points earned to register.
To redeem points against an intended purchase in a GAC store, the Card Holder must present their Reward Card to a member of the GAC sales team at the till at the beginning of the transaction. To redeem points against an intended purchases online, login to your account and select the option to pay by redeeming points at the appropriate point during the payment process.
Reward points can be used as part payment towards a product both online and in a GAC store. Reward points will be earned on products where points have been redeemed as payment or part payment for that product.
Reward points have no cash redemption value. Reward points are for Card Holder's personal use and cannot be exchanged, sold or transferred to another Card Holder's account.
If a transaction on which points are earned or redeemed is cancelled or reversed or a product is returned (in accordance with GAC's Returns Policy) GAC will reverse the associated points earned or redeemed. Card Holders must present their Reward Card to a member of the GAC sales team when they require a refund so that points awarded can be debited from the Reward Card for the product being returned.
The GAC Reward Card programme is operated and promoted by Glasgow Angling Centre Ltd, Unit 1 The Point, 29 Saracen Street, Glasgow, G22 5HT, Tel: 0141 212 8880, email: enquiries@fishingmegastore.com, web: www.fishingmegastore.com

GAC will notify Card Holders of any changes to these Terms and Conditions by posting notices in store and online. GAC will give Card Holders as much notice of any changes, suspension or termination as it reasonably can. Earning or redeeming points will constitute acceptance of any amended Terms and Conditions.
