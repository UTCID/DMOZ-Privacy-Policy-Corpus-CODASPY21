CARE AND REPAIR
Caring For Your King Baby Jewelry
Any piece of jewelry will retain its beauty and last longer if properly cared for.
Sometimes, simply cleaning a piece of jewelry can make it look like new. Ideally, jewelry should be professionally cleaned once a year. Your nearest King Baby boutique can facilitate this, or you may call 615 248-4318.
Periodic inspection and maintenance of jewelry helps prevent costly repairs or replacements. Look for loose or chipped stones, worn links, bent prongs, or malfunctioning clasps. If a problem is found, the piece should be brought in immediately for repair to prevent more extensive damage or loss.
King Baby jewelry should only be repaired at our authorized repair centers. Our facilities are designed exclusively for King Baby jewelry, and highly experienced professional jewelers will handle each repair. To find out how to deliver your piece for repair, please call 615 248-4318.
It is our experience that a jeweler unfamiliar with King Baby jewelry can do more harm than good. We will repair any piece of King Baby jewelry, but poor craftsmanship by an unauthorized jeweler is considered damage and may add to the cost of the repair.
How to Avoid Damaging Gemstones
Some gemstones are by nature more fragile than others. In general, you can prevent many problems by not exposing gemstones to chemicals such as chlorine or extreme heat or light, all of which can cause fractures, breakage, and discoloration. Salt water should be avoided, as well.
All gemstones, including diamonds, can chip, scratch, or abrade under the right circumstances. Avoid wearing rings or bracelets while doing any manual labor, including housework. Jewelry should be taken off before strenuous activity or during times when it might be subjected to sharp blows or excessive friction.
Never remove rings by pulling on the stone; the prongs or bezel can be damaged causing the stone to loosen or fall out.
Store each piece of gemstone jewelry separately in its storage pouch to prevent excessive tarnishing and scratching.
How to Clean Your King Baby Jewelry
Over time, lotions, powders, soaps, and natural skin oils can make jewelry and gemstones appear dull. Below are some tips for keeping your pieces clean and shiny.
Cleaning Silver Jewelry
Sterling silver tarnishes in the presence of common everyday items that contain sulfur, such as leather, rubber, and chlorine. Other elements to be mindful of are air pollutants and salt water. Because these substances cannot be completely avoided, it is recommended that sterling silver be routinely wiped down with the white side of the King Baby polishing cloth that came with your piece. Regular wear of your King Baby sterling silver can also help prevent tarnishing—we recommend that you enjoy and wear your King Baby jewelry every day. When not in use, store your jewelry in the pouch that came with it.
To remove heavier tarnish, wash your silver jewelry with warm water and mild soap or Connoisseurs® Jewelry Wipes. Never use anything but a clean, nub-free cotton or flannel cloth, a special sterling silver cleaning cloth, or a very soft bristle brush like a baby’s toothbrush. We do not recommend wet silver polish or dip style cleaning solutions, which will remove the antique oxidation that we intentionally apply to many King Baby silver pieces to give them their distinctive look. If more thorough cleaning is required, an authorized jeweler can clean your pieces to restore them to their original condition. We recommend having your jewelry professionally cleaned once a year.
Cleaning Gold Jewelry
Using gentle dish soap, prepare a small bowl of warm suds and soak each piece before brushing with a soft baby’s toothbrush. When clean, transfer jewelry to a strainer, rinse under warm running water, and pat dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.
Cleaning Jewelry with Crystalline Gemstones
Crystalline gemstones, such as amethyst, blue topaz, citrine, or peridot attract oils and lotions causing them to appear dull. To clean, soak them in a bowl of water with a touch of gentle dish soap. A soft baby’s toothbrush may be used to scrub around and behind the stone. After cleaning, place your jewelry in a strainer and rinse before thoroughly drying with a lint-free cloth.
Cleaning Jewelry with Organic and Opaque Gemstones
Never use an ultrasonic cleaner or chemicals (including bleach or ammonia) on organic gems and opaque stones such as pearls, opals, coral, turquoise, and lapis lazuli. They should only be wiped clean with a damp cloth. In addition, avoid contact with hairspray, lotions, and perfumes, which can be absorbed over time, causing discoloration. Opals and pearls require humidity. When storing them, make sure the environment is not too dry or they may crack.
PERSONAL SHOPPING
