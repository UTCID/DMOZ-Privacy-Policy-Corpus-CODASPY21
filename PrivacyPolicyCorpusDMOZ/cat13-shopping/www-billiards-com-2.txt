My Account
We will not share your personal information (name, email, address, phone) with anyone for any reason unless compelled to do so by law. Your information is only used to process your order.
Security
We utilize a secure site for our shopping cart and account management, using encrypted transactions for all your credit card and personal information. When you see 'https' rather than 'http' in your browser's address window when checking out, the data is encrypted as it is passed between your computer and our servers. This prevents outsiders from obtaining personal data or credit card information as it is sent over the internet.
We use ScanAlert, Inc. to perform a comprehensive security audit on our website every day. ScanAlert is used by over 75,000 websites, including over half of the top 500 ecommerce sites, to handle their internet security. This level of security screening exceeds the guidelines set forth by the credit card companies to protect your personal and credit information.
Emails
Our order processing software automatically sends out an order confirmation email when an order is received. A ship confirmation email is sent (if the order is shipped via UPS) at the end of the day when the order is shipped. These emails are automatic and are sent by our server software. If you have spam blocking software, you may not be able to receive the emails. If you do not receive an order confirmation email or a ship confirmation email, you can check the status of your order by clicking on My Account in the upper right corner on our website.
We do not send any unsolicited emails. If you wish to receive our email newsletters which include special offers and information about new products, you can join our email news list. You can join this list when you create your account the first time you order, or by clicking on My Account if you already have an account. You have the option to receive emails at most once a week, twice a month, or once a month. All emails will include a link to remove your email address from future newsletter mailings.
