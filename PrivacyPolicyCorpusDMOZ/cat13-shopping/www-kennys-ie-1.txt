We Are Committed To Protecting Your Privacy
We are committed to protecting your privacy in all aspects of our business and we hope you will take the time to read this policy. This policy explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will endeavor to post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to. You are kindly requested to check back periodically for any changes to this policy. By using the books.kennys.ie web site and purchasing from us, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
Purchase By Children
It is our policy not to sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use the Kennys.ie web sites only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
The Information We Collect And How We Use It
When you visit the Kennys.ie web sites, we may collect your IP address in order to diagnose problems or issues with our server and to improve the manner in which we sell to you, our customer. Your IP address is not used identify you in any manner but helps us to gather broad demographic information.
The www.kennys.ie web site uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but enable us to provide a shopping cart and to store your order information between visits. If you've set your browser to reject cookies, you can still use our site, but will not be able to purchase items. We recommend that you leave them turned on
To request more information about an item, you must provide your e-mail address so that we may reply to your question by e-mail. To order from us you must set up an account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your email address and choose a password. We also ask for your name, shipping address, telephone number (your "Order Information"). This information is necessary for us to process your order, to notify you of your order status, and to fulfill orders. We do not provide any personal information such as your e-mail address or billing information to any third party.
Kennys have a formal arrangement with a secure third party site [Realex Payments] where you must enter your credit card number, billing address, and expiration date to secure payment. Realex Payments uses a secure server. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all information you input. The security of this procedure is such that Kennys are not given access to you credit card information. We are simply instructed by Realex Payments that the credit card has been authorized. Realex Payments are not permitted to use your information for any other purposes than to secure payment for you purchase from us.
Alternatively you may pay through Paypal or Stripe, which are also secure third party sites.
You may from time to time choose not to use our third party secure sites and may send us your credit card details directly. While we cannot be responsible for the manner in which you transmit this information, we can assure you that credit card details will be used to process a payment and then destroyed. Access to this information shall be strictly limited to authorized personnel and shall not be transmitted or divulged to any third party.
