Communication
Nearly all communication is made via e-mail so please ensure a valid working
account is used and check your mail if you are expecting a message from us.
If you use one of the free e-mail services such as “Yahoo” or “Hotmail”
and are expecting an e-mail from us please check your “Bulk” folders
as sometimes your mail program can put our e-mails into there. If you use any
kind of “Spam Filter” requiring us to register to send you mail
then unfortunately we cannot do this, please ensure you add our domain “modelsforsale.com”
to your mail filters to allow mail through. You can always contact us by the
telephone/ fax and numbers are listed on our website. We may contact you by
phone if there is a problem with your order. All e-mail communication is deemed
as “not secure” therefore any sensitive information must not be
included with such communication i.e credit card numbers. Models For Sale Ltd
cannot be held responsible for any information transmitted in this way becoming
compromised by a third party.
Orders.
You can place your order Online, Telephone, Fax or by Post. As some of our items
are unique we request all of our customers to reserve stock before sending /
making any payments. Online orders and phone orders are reserved automatically
at the time of order, any orders sent by Fax or Post require the stock to be
reserved first by Phone / E-mail. If you send a payment without reserving the
stock first we may not be able to fulfil your order and in this case will return
the payment.
Stock Levels
We try to maintain “accurate” stock levels on our website and you
are only able to order items that are available for sale, we do not accept forward
orders or back orders as we can never be sure when stocks may be available leaving
you the option to purchase elsewhere. Unfortunately on the very odd occasion
we may not be able to fulfil your order due to an incorrect stock level, in
this instance we will contact you to see what you wish to do, (i.e. receive
partial order, cancel order or supply alternative item).
Postage Costs.
UK Orders
Postage costs are detailed on our website and are subject to change without
notice but not once your order has been submitted.
International Orders.
Postage costs are viewable at the bottom of your basket or at checkout based on weight / size and value.

we will arrange with you the return of the item re-imbursing postal costs and
cost of goods as applicable. We will only refund “Reasonable” postage
costs not expensive courier or special delivery options.

safe return of goods to ourselves and should use a suitable postal method covering
any financial loses if goods lost or damaged in the post. Suitable packing should
be used and we advise against “Brown Paper” and that items returned
are sent in a “box” by Recorded Post for low value items and Standard
Parcels with enhanced compensation for expensive items are deemed suitable refundable
postage options.
Refunds

costs in returning the item to us if it is a “change of heart” item
but are included if item is deemed as faulty, we will converse with you during
