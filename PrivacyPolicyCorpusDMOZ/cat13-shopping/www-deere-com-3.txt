Cookies - How they are usedCookies: How they are usedWhen you visit or interact with John Deere's Online Services, John Deere (and/or authorized third parties) store and/or access data using Cookies. The specific types of technologies used may change from time-to-time, but the following is a brief description of how Cookies are used on the Online Services.
Essential or Necessary Cookies
Essential or Necessary Cookies. These are Cookies that are necessary for the functioning of the Online Services. For example, they are used to enable the operation of the Online Services, enable access to secure areas of the Online Services, remember previous actions (e.g., entered text when navigating back to a page in the same session), remember items placed in a shopping basket or cart during a session, secure the Online Services and for the administration of the Online Services (e.g., load balancing, fraud prevention). Without these Cookies, the Online Services would not function properly and/or John Deere may be unable to provide certain services.
Functional Cookies
These are Cookies that are not necessary to the operation of the Online Services, but they enhance the use of the Online Services by remembering certain choices you may make and providing enhanced features. For example, they are used to remember site preferences or choices, such as remembering preferences for language, country, region or other online settings made (e.g., text size, fonts). These cookies and other technologies can be used to enable requested functions such as watching a video (e.g., YouTube video) or providing comments. They can also be used to prevent a service(s) from being offered to you if you already received it or previously indicated you do not wish to receive it (e.g. requests to participate in certain types of surveys). If you have an account with the Online Services the information collected may be associated with your account.
Functional Cookies also collect information about how the Online Services are used, including which pages are visited most often, the browser or operating system used, where users have come to the Online Services from, whether an item or link is viewed or used, error messages generated and whether communications John Deere sends are opened or read (also known as analytics or performance Cookies). This information is used to help John Deere improve its Online Services, count the number of visitors, identity usage patterns, fix issues in the Online Services, and make the Online Services easier to use. If you have an account with the Online Services the information collected may be associated with your account.
Some analytics and performance Cookies are used in connection with services provided by third parties, including the following:
Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics may collect information about your use of the Online Services (including your IP address). Information generated will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States of America. For more information, please visit Google's site. Google also provides a browser add-on that allows you to opt-out of Google Analytics across all websites.
Adobe Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Adobe. Adobe Analytics is used to collect information about your use of the Online Services (including your IP address). Information generated will be transmitted to and stored by Adobe on servers in the United States of America. For more information, please visit Adobe's site.

They also are used to limit the number of times you may see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They remember you visited the Online Services (including pages visited and links followed) and this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers and advertising networks. These cookies usually are placed by third-parties. Data collected through Functional Cookies (such as analytics and performance Cookies) also may be used, in part, to facilitate advertising.Third Party CookiesThird Party CookiesJohn Deere may use third parties who use their own Cookies to store and/or access data relating to your use of, and interaction with, the Online Services.

The Online Services may contain content from third parties such as Google Maps, YouTube, ZMags and ShareThis and plugins from social media sites like Facebook ("Like" button), Twitter ("Share to Twitter") and Linkedin. When you connect to these services, the third parties may store and/or access data using Cookies over which John Deere does not have control, including their own Functional or Targeting or Advertising Cookies.

John Deere's Cookie Consent Manager is a browser cookie-based tool that may allow you to modify settings related to certain Functional and Targeting or Advertising Cookies.

The tool works by communicating the selected setting to third party companies to initiate a third party's opt-out mechanism, if available. The effect of such selection may be described in the third party's cookie, privacy and/or data sharing statements. If the tool is unable to integrate with a third party this will be noted in the Advanced Settings page with information about such third party. The Advanced Settings page will also provide information about Cookies used on the Online Services.
The tool will only work on the Internet browser you use to make your choice and it will only function properly if your browser is set to accept third-party browser cookies. If you delete cookies, change browsers, computers or operating systems, you will need to make a new selection.
