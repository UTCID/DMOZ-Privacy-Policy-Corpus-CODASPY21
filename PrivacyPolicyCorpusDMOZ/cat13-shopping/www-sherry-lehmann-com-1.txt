Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Sherry-Lehmann respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide Sherry-Lehmann will be known only to two parties: you and Sherry-Lehmann. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site and its features. Personal information includes your name, street and email addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here.
This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
Traffic Data
Each time a visitor comes to the Sherry-Lehmann.com website, our server—like most on the Web—collects some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or earthlink.net, etc.), and browser and platform type (e.g., an Internet Explorer browser on a Windows XP computer).
We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows about visitors and visits into group data).
Use of Cookies
Sherry-Lehmann.com assigns “cookies” to your web browser. Cookies are small text files that allow a website to remember who a visitor is and therefore not require them to type in personal information over and over again.
