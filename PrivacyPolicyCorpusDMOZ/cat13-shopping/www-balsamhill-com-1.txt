Claims and Disputes
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING FROM THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, USE OF THE WEBSITE, OR YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY BALSAM HILL THROUGH THE WEBSITE SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT.
ANY SUCH ARBITRATION PROCEEDING SHALL APPLY CALIFORNIA LAW AND SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.
YOU AND BALSAM BRANDS INC. ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (AAA) UNDER ITS RULES.
PAYMENT OF FILING, ADMINISTRATION, AND ARBITRATOR FEES WILL BE GOVERNED BY AAA’S RULES.
BALSAM HILL WILL PAY ANY SUCH FEES CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARBITRATION (BUT NOT YOUR ATTORNEYS’ FEES) FOR CLAIMS TOTALING LESS THAN USD10,000.00 UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THE CLAIMS ARE FRIVOLOUS, IN WHICH CASE YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL PAY SAID FEES.
THE ARBITRATOR WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO ARBITRABILITY AND/OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING ANY UNCONSCIONABILITY CHALLENGE OR ANY OTHER CHALLENGE THAT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION OR THE AGREEMENT IS VOID, VOIDABLE, OR OTHERWISE INVALID. THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE EMPOWERED TO GRANT WHATEVER RELIEF WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT UNDER LAW OR IN EQUITY.
ANY AWARD OF THE ARBITRATOR(S) WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON EACH OF THE PARTIES, AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT RATHER THAN ARBITRATION IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY, AND IF YOU PROVIDED US WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR INTENTION TO DO SO WITHIN 60 DAYS OF YOUR PURCHASE.
THE ARBITRATION OR SMALL-CLAIMS COURT PROCEEDING WILL BE LIMITED SOLELY TO YOUR INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY.
YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
YOU ALSO AGREE THAT YOU OR WE MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THE UNENFORCEABLE PROVISION WILL BE SEVERED AND THE REMAINING ARBITRATION TERMS WILL BE ENFORCED.
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE PURCHASE OF BALSAM HILL PRODUCTS) MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES OR BE BARRED FOREVER.

Visitors who register or participate in other site features such as marketing programs and “members-only” content will be given a choice whether they would like to be on our email list and receive e-mail communications and catalogs from us.
HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
Unfortunately no data transmission over the internet or electronic data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety and integrity of your information. Your information is contained behind secured networks to prohibit unauthorized access, and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.
If you have a personal password which enables you to access certain parts of our website or any other portal, app or service we operate, it is your responsibility to keep this password confidential. You are fully responsible for any activity that takes place by a party that is logged into our website using your user name and password, unless such activity is conducted by us or one of our agents. We ask that you not to share your password with anyone.
DO WE USE "COOKIES"?
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also collect your email address via cookies and pixels on the Website through the use of trusted third party partners. These partners may also combine your email information with other information to which they have access, such as mailing addresses, so that we may serve relevant marketing offers to you via email and direct mail, provided you have opted in to receive them.
We may contract with carefully chosen third-party service providers and data processors to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, even if disabling cookies makes it impossible to order products through our website, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.
DO WE DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described below. The term "outside parties" does not include our affiliates and website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.
Occasionally, we may provide your email address or physical address to marketing partners in an effort to make you aware of products or services in which you may have an interest. In addition, non-personally identifiable visitor information, including generalized or aggregated visitor information, may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and mailing addresses only) and general shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you. We do not share email addresses for this purpose. If you prefer that we do not share any of your information with these companies, please contact us or unsubscribe from our catalog mailing list per the instructions below.

Privacy Notice For California Residents
This Privacy Notice for California Residents is provided pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and applies to California residents and supplements our overall Privacy Policy.
Consumer Rights
As of 01 January 2020, California residents have the following rights:
Notice and accessYou have the right to know: (a) the categories of personal information we collect about you; (b) the categories of sources from which the information was collected; (c) the business or commercial purpose for collecting, disclosing, or selling personal information; and (d) the categories of third parties we have disclosed or sold personal information to for a business purpose and the categories of personal information disclosed.
You may request that Balsam provide you access to the specific pieces of personal information collected about you in a readily usable format. Please note that your access rights under the CCPA are not absolute.

DeletionYou may request that we delete any personal information that we have collected from or about you. As described in our overall Privacy Policy, there are some reasons or instances we will not be able to fully address your deletion request, such as if we need to complete a transaction for you, to detect and protect against fraudulent and illegal activity, to exercise our rights, or to comply with a legal obligation such as honoring warranty claims.
Opt-out of Sale of Personal InformationYou may request to opt-out of our sale of your personal information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes.
Due to the way our customer information systems work, if you exercise your right to opt-out, we will not only – moving forward – cease sharing your personal information to such third parties for use for their purposes, but we will also take you off our catalog list or, if you are not yet in our catalog list, you will not receive our catalogs even if you subscribe to the same.
You would still be able to see our products at our website and are welcome to sign up for our promotional emails.
Non-DiscriminationThe CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against a customer for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
Balsam will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
California consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us directly at customerservice@balsamhill.com with the subject line “CCPA Rights Request” or calling our Customer Service team at 800-350-7114.
Please describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Only you or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
We will verify your request using existing information that we have about you. We may request additional materials or information for the purposes of validating the authenticity of your request.
Balsam will use the information provided in connection with a verification request solely for the purposes of verification. We will not be able to implement your request if we are unable to verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. We will respond to your request within 45 days of your verified request, unless we need additional time, in which case we will let you know.
There may be other situations where Balsam is unable or not required to fulfill your CCPA rights request.
In such cases, we will respond to your request within the period required by the CCPA and provide relevant details regarding Balsam’s determination and any additional relevant information about your rights request.

Under the CCPA and existing California law, this qualifies as a “sale” of personal information.
