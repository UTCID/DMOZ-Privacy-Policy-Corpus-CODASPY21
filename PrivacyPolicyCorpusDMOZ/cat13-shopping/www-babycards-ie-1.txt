Terms and Conditions
Business Details
Sleepymoon Cards is owned and operated by Naomi Edwards and Natalie French with an email of hello@sleepymooncards.ie
Terms of Use
Please read these Terms of Use carefully as they contain important information about your rights and obligations. By placing an order on www.sleepymooncards.ie you fully and unconditionally agree to these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions may be altered at our discretion at any time and without prior notice and will be updated on this page. Please note that the terms and conditions applicable on the date of your order will apply to you.
Privacy
Sleepymoon Cards respects and cares about your privacy and will not use any customer information provided for any other purpose other than for the fulfillment and delivery of the order. Personal information such as your name, address, email address and phone number are only used to complete transactions you request. Sleepymoon Cards will use the necessary security safeguards to protect personal information against, loss, theft and unauthorised access.
Prices
Our prices are detailed on the website in Euros and are VAT inclusive. We reserve the right to revise prices without notice, however all orders will be delivered at the price displayed to the customer at the time of ordering.
Delivery
We endeavor to have your cards delivered to you in 3 working days from receipt of your order. Please note, that we are not responsible for delivery delays outside or beyond our control.
Customer Satisfaction
Our mission is to ensure that our customers receive the highest quality premium cards, in terms of both design and paper. All of our cards are printed using the highest quality digital printing press available.
There are certain factors outside or beyond our control:
a) The quality of the photo uploaded by our customers is outside our control so please refer to our photography tips or FAQ’s photo submission sections if you have any doubts over the quality of your chosen photo. If you use a photo that we recommend not using, we will not provide a refund.
b) Computer settings vary from computer to computer and may mean the card preview in screen may have ever so slightly different tonal representations from our printing presses.
c) If you approve a proof that has missing or wrong information, capitalisation or spelling mistakes or typos, we will not provide a refund. Therefore, it’s very important to review your proof carefully prior to approval and purchase.
In the event you receive cards, which you consider unsatisfactory and which fall outside of the above factors, you should return them to the above address within 7 working days from the day you received your order. If, in our reasonable assessment, and after allowing for the above, the complaint is justified, we will offer replacement cards or a full refund within 5-7 working days. Please note that any refund will exclude the return of cards to our office, but will include return delivery.
Secure Payment Gateway
www.sleepymooncards.ie have contracted Stripe and PayPal to process all our online payments. Both payment gateways offer a secure payment gateway system and at no time do Sleepymoon Cards have any access to the payment details provided by our customers. Your order will automatically be sent for processing once payment has been successfully confirmed.
Your Conduct
We ask customers not to upload any unlawful or offensive images or material, which could be damaging to third parties. In addition we ask customers not to upload any images or text for which they do not have appropriate and proper rights.
