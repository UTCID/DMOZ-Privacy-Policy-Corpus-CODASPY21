Privacy Policy
Your Privacy
We will not, under any circumstances sell your personal information to third parties. This includes profiles, purchase and email addresses. The information given to us by our customers is used ONLY to fulfill orders and communicate with them about their orders, delivery fulfillment or financing requests.
Your Security is Important to Us
Safe and Secure
We protect your transactions by encrypting sensitive data from the point of entry by the customer right through completion of the transaction. Your purchase is not debited when you make your purchase as most other sites.  No credit card numbers are stored in any way long-term and none are stored online.
Secure Sockets Layer or SSL, ("https" - hypertext transfer protocol secure) for short, is simply the method for submitting purchase information to our site. Secure Socket Layer is an encryption technology on the server that scrambles important data such as credit card numbers and order information when it is being stored or passed from one computer to another. When you enter your credit card information, you will see a small lock or key a near the bottom of your browser. We have not one or two, but three firewalls on our internal network so there is no way an intruder can get your email address or any other information. Your privacy is important to us.

Howard Miller offers a limited two year warranty on grandfather clocks and a one year warranty on mantel, wall and tabletop clocks.
If any problems occur with your merchandise, you should contact us and speak with a customer service representative. All you have to do is report the problem and we will take the rest!! If your product is still under warranty, NO cost will be incurred on your part to have the merchandise replaced or repaired.
