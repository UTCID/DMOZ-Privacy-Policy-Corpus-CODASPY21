Order Problems and Product Questions
If you experience problems while shopping at Kiefer.com, please contact Kiefer Customer Service, send an email to
or call 1-800-323-4071.
Credit Card Payments
When an order is placed on Kiefer.com, an amount is authorized on your credit card. This authorization will impact the amount available to spend on your credit card, and for that reason, we have decided to initially authorize just $0.50. If for any reason, your credit card is not approved, you're available to spend amount has then only been impacted by $0.50. Once confirmation has been received from our credit card processor that the transaction will be approved, the full amount of the order is authorized.
Amounts authorized at the time of the order are settled only when we ship the order, and only for the products we ship. If an amount has not been settled, the authorization will expire in 3 to 5 days from the initial authorization depending on your bank. That is when the $0.50 is removed from your account.
