Last Revised 6.30.2020
Your privacy is of utmost important to us.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what personal information may be collected through our websites and other online services, how that information is used, to whom it is disclosed to, and what Hickory Farms, LLC. does to protect it.  This Policy applies to personal information collected through websites, mobile applications, SMS messaging, and other services of the Hickory Farms brands or lines of businesses that adopt, link to, or display this policy (collectively, the “Services”).  Hickory Farms, LLC., 311 S Wacker Dr., Suite 2030, Chicago, IL 60606 (“Hickory Farms,” “we,” ”us,” ”our”, or “HF”) owns and operates all Services and is responsible for this  Policy.

Technologies we implement include, but are necessarily limited to:
(a)    Cookies.  A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device’s hard drive.  Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use both of them:
(1) session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and
(2) persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.
We use the following categories of cookies on our Website.
i.    Strictly Necessary Cookies.  These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have requested, such as maintaining a record of your purchased items (e.g. a shopping cart), cannot be provided.
ii.    Performance Cookies.  These cookies collect anonymous information on how people use our Website to help us understand how you arrive at our site, browse or use our Website and highlight areas where we can improve, such as navigation. The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established.
iii.    Functionality Cookies.  These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit our Website, your preferred language, and your search parameters. This information can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make your visits to our Website more tailored to your preferences. The information in these cookies may be anonymized.   These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
iv.    Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.  The cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks.  These cookies remember the websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties such as Google Ad Network advertisers.
Of course, if you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser’s settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website’s features or lose access to some functionality.
(b)    Web Beacons.  A Web Beacon is an electronic image. Web Beacons can track certain things from your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behavior. If you choose to receive emails from us, we may use Web Beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of our third-party marketing partners may use Web Beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners on our Website.  This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your Personal Information.  Please note that any image file on a webpage can act as a Web Beacon.
(c)    Embedded Web Links.  Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients.  Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.
(d)    Third-party Websites and Services.  We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The information collected can be gathered on our Website and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites.
(e)     Google Analytics.  The Website sends aggregated, non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the Website’s performance.  For more information on how Google Analytics supports the Website and uses information sent from the Website, please review Google’s privacy policy available at: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.

This information is also maintained at: California: Your Privacy Rights
Users in the European Union
If you access our Services from the European Union, you may be afforded additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  The legal basis for our processing of your personal data in connection with our Services is Art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR, which allows processing of Personal Information, or “personal data,” as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access our Services, you form a contract with us based on our Terms of Use, and we need to process your personal data to respond to your requests, ship products to you and satisfy our obligations with respect to the other purposes listed in this Policy.
As exceptions, we rely on your consent with respect to cookies per Art. 6.1(a) GDPR, and legitimate interests under Art. 6.1(f) EU GDPR, especially with respect to situations where we must process your personal data to comply with applicable laws (as a U.S. based company, we are subject to U.S. laws and must comply, just like EEA-based companies have to comply with EEA laws).
When you access our Services, you transfer your personal data to the United States of America for which the European Union Commission has not yet issued an unlimited adequacy decision.
We will process and keep your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, for our legitimate business needs, and for compliance with applicable law.
You have a right to request from us these EU GDPR rights concerning your personal data: access to data; rectification of data; erasure of data; restriction on processing; objection to data processing; and data portability. You can exercise these rights through a combination of actions: accessing the information in your account; exercising your opt-out options through our Services; and by calling 1-800-648-8075 or email us at: privacy@hickoryfarms.com.
If you have provided consent for direct marketing emails or other data processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
We do not use automated decision-making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) EU GDPR, that is, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or significantly affects you. Our Services’ customization technologies and e-commerce processes are automated, but do not produce legal effects or affect you significantly as contemplated by Art. 22(1) or (2) GDPR.
Changes to this Policy
If we make any changes to this Policy, a revised Policy will be posted on this webpage and the date of the change will be reported in the “Last Revised” block above. You can get to this page from any of our webpages by clicking on the “Privacy Policy” link (usually at the bottom of the screen).
Conditions of Use and Contact Information
Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Use. Please direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy to:  privacy@hickoryfarms.com or by calling 1-800-648-8075.
