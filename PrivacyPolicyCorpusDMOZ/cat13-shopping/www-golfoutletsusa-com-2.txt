Personal Data and other information is collected from you when you create an Account with us or when you otherwise disclose Personal Data or other information to us or third parties when using the Services. “Personal Data” means any information that may be used to identify an individual. Personal Data does not include aggregate information.

We and third parties with whom we may partner may collect location information in relation to a User’s Device and use of the Services (“Location Data”) with respect to you. If you use the Services, then you are providing consent to collect Location Data such as the physical location of your Device which will be used to provide you with certain features of the Services. This Location Data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you. Location Data is aggregated with data from Devices of other Users to enhance the quality of Content Users provide to us and to enhance the quality of the Services we provide to you. We may also share your Location data with third parties. Location Data is shared anonymously in a form that would not personally identify you.(c) Use Data.

However, we may log your IP address to give us an idea of which part of the Services you visit and how long you spend there. However, we do not link your IP address to any Personal Data unless you have logged into the Services or previously engaged in a transaction with us. Also, the Services may use a standard technology called a ‘cookie’ to collect information about how you interact with the Services. Please see “Cookies” below for more information.(e) Aggregate Data. Certain aspects of the Services are set up to collect and report aggregate information. Aggregate information is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of products, services or Users, from which individual identities or other Personal Data has been removed. In other words, information about how you use the Services may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Services. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and User’s needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Services. This Policy does not restrict what we can do with aggregate information.(f) Google Analytics. We use a tool called ‘Google Analytics’ to collect information about use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often Users visit the Website, what pages Users visit when Users visit the Website, and the other websites they accessed prior to accessing the Website.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique User the next time you visit the Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

If you use such functionality of the Services, then you should use caution when determining to whom you want to make Content available.

A cookie is a text file that is placed on your Device or computer by a server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your Device or computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by the server that issued the cookie to you. A clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is used in conjunction with the Services, which allows us or third parties with whom we may partner to measure the actions of Users who interact with the portion of the Services that contain the clear GIF. We and other third parties use clear GIFs to measure traffic and related browsing behavior, and to improve your experience when using the Services.
