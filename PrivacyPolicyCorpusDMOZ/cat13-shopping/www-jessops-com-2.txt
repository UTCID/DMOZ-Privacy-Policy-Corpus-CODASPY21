Where is my data stored?
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our third party data storage providers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You must not share your password with anyone.
Many of the third parties we work with who help us run our business are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Because of this, their processing of your personal information will often involve it being transferred outside of the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;
by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same legal protection it has as if it never left the EEA; and
where we use organisations based in the United States, we may transfer your personal information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protections to those your personal information has when it is in the EEA.
To keep this privacy policy as short and easy to understand as possible, we have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used. You can contact us at cs@jessops.com for the details as to how we protect specific transfers of your data.
How long do we retain your data for?

If you tell us that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, we promise to stop sending them to you and will delete any additional data we no longer need to hold about you within 90 days of your unsubscribe request.
Where we have processed your data for any other reason (such as where you have contacted us with a question in connection with potentially purchasing a product) we will retain your data for 2 years.
If you upload photos to your account for the purposes of our photo printing products and services, we will retain those photos for up to 6 months.
