Bauhaus 2 Your House is not responsible for delays in shipments due to
circumstances beyond our control, such as acts of God, international
port delays and closures, terrorism, or other customs, freight, or
shipping delays. Every effort is made to meet our estimated shipping
dates, but failure to do so does not justify their cancellation.
Warranties
Bauhaus 2 Your House reserves the right, at its sole discretion to
change, modify, add or remove any portion of these terms and conditions of use,
in whole, or in part at any time. Designs, materials, construction, production

Bauhaus 2 Your House reserves the right to modify and/or improve all
products that we offer for sale.
Bauhaus 2 Your House warrants its products to be free from
defects in material or workmanship, given normal use and care, for a period of
1 Year from the date as indicated on the invoice, subject
to the limitations set forth:
During this warranty period, Bauhaus 2 Your House will,
at its option, repair or replace, free of charge to the original owner,
any part or assembly found to be defective. This warranty is not transferable
and terminates when a third party becomes entitled to use the product during
the warranty period. Claims must be in writing. All claims must include the
name, address, and telephone number of the purchase, unit model number,
general description of the product, description of the defect(s),
photographs, and documentation supporting the date of initial delivery.
Bauhaus 2 Your House will contact the customer to arrange

our estimated shipping dates, but failure to do so does not justify
their cancellation. Factory Direct -- products made to
order -- are not returnable.All canceled orders will be subject to a
minimum 10% charge.
Receipt of Goods
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RECEIVING YOUR GOODS IN A
TIMELY MANNER. The goods shall become the property of the Purchaser at
the time It arrives at your front door. If delivery is prevented by
difficult access, incorrect Information, or if the Purchaser wrongfully
fails to arrange to receive the delivery as per the arrangements with
the Delivery Service, the Purchaser is still responsible for the
goods. ANY DAMAGE OR COSTS INCURRED FOLLOWING DELIVERY OR ATTEMPTED
DELIVERY SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PURCHASER. FAILURE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE OR RECEIVE GOODS IN A TIMELY MANNER IS NOT THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF BAUHAUS TO YOUR HOUSE.
You will be issued an email at the time of shipping from the delivery service with
tracking information; we are not responsible for filtered content. Items
returned to the Bauhaus 2 Your House warehouse after repeated attempted
delivery (services make at least three delivery attempts and leave
notice) are the property of the purchaser, and will be re-shipped at the
purchaser's expense. Damaged product will not be repaired or
replaced unless the shipping error is determined to be the fault of
Bauhaus 2 Your House (i.e. order shipped to wrong state). An order canceled at this
point will be assessed a 50% restocking fee plus the cost of the original delivery.
Damage Return Policy
Claims for defective or damaged items must be filed with us within 3 days
of delivery, in writing, with images. Please inspect your items immediately upon delivery.
All shipments are picked up by the transportation company and signed for in
good condition. (Bauhaus 2 Your House's
liability ceases at that time). When you receive product from our
freight carriers, it is extremely important to inspect the carton/crate
for any damage or even an indication of the possibility of damage
before signing any documentation. You will be asked to sign a delivery
receipt, which is essentially a legal contract that indicates you are
receiving the product in perfect condition. All delivery receipts
contain a box to note any "visible" damage on the carton/crate. This is
your insurance that you will have the ability to be awarded the freight claim;
without notation of damage (or the indication thereof) there is no recourse. If
damage is noted, you must keep product in original shipping box or
container for inspection by carrier. Enter a claim with the
transportation company. If you have any questions regarding this policy
or the process involved, please feel free to contact us directly at
(888) 272-5331 or email Customer Service.
Receiving Glass and Marble
While our glass and marble pieces are shipped using industry standards and
best practices, they are vulnerable materials, and even under the best conditions,
damages sometimes occur. IT IS THEREFORE CRITICAL THAT YOU BE AWARE AND ADVISED OF HOW TO
RECEIVE THESE PIECES. Damage to glass and marble pieces MUST be noted at
the time of delivery. These items arrive crated, you will need
to carefully inspect them while they are intact, or de-crate them
for proper inspection. FAILURE TO INSPECT ITEMS AT TIME OF DELIVERY, OR
SIGNING FOR DAMAGED PRODUCT "IN GOOD CONDITION" MAY MAKE YOUR DAMAGE
CLAIM OR CREDIT CARD REBUTTLE IMPOSSIBLE.
