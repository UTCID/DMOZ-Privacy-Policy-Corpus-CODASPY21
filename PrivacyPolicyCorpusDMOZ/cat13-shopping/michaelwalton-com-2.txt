Payment
With the exception of IN STOCK ITEMS, all my work is made to order and by me only. Please contact me regarding my delivery timeline. Expect to wait from 4 -16 weeks for website orders. I require a minimum of 25% deposit to secure order and estimated delivery with the balance due when I am ready to start the order. Select pay by Check to complete online order and I can bill you through paypal for 25% deposit. I will accept payments by arrangement on an individual basis. A temporary hold is put on your paypal. I will adjust the invoice prior to charging for 25% deposit and set up regular payments if preferred. I'm very flexible. If you prefer select "check" option at checkout and the order will come through. We can then work together and I can charge your paypal.
All transactions will be processed in US$. I accept Credit Card payments through PAYPAL, CHECK or MONEY ORDER drawn on a US bank. Payments are also accepted by arrangement.
Shipping
Shipping is calculated at cost. Miniature Furniture will be sent by insured USPS or UPS. Full size furniture will be shipped by your shipper of choice. Assembled houses can also be sent Greyhound ($1000 limit insurance). You can also pickup at my Chicago workshop.
Damage or loss in TransitIn the unlikely event of items damaged or missing from a package this must be reported to me within 7 days. It is imperative that you open all packages on receipt. All packaging must be retained by the customer for inspection by us or the relevant postal service. I do not accept any responsibility for damaged or lost goods in transit. You will have to file a claim with the relevant carrier. I will assist you with the necessary receipts etc.
Return of Goods
I am here to answer all your questions about my furniture before purchasing. I will not entertain any complaint after 7 days. Custom orders are non-refundable. If by arrangement I do accept a return it will be subject to a 30% re-stocking fee, with the balance to be applied to another item.
Pricing and Modification of My Range
I reserve the right to alter prices without prior notification. As all items are handmade, pieces may vary from those pictured because of differences in materials used, custom changes by client etc.
