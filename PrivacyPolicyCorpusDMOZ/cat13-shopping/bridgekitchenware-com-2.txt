SHIPPING RATES AND METHODS:
Free Ground Shipping within the Continental USA on all orders of $99 or more. Shipment method is at our discretion.
We ship all orders within the Continental USA by Ground UPS or USPS Priority Mail. If you are located within an area that UPS has designated a Local Surcharge Area, we will notify you of any additional handling fees imposed by UPS or or offer shipping by the US Post Office. For orders to be shipped to Alaska or Hawaii, if they can be shipped via the USPS, we will do so. If they must be shipped via UPS, an additional fee may be required. We will contact you in this situation and allow you to cancel your order if you wish.
On Domestic USA orders, we address verify all billing addresses of credit cards. Please be sure to provide us with the exact information that appears on your credit card statement to avoid any delays in processing your order.
Please be sure to check your shipping address carefully before submitting your order and be sure to include any apartment suite or floor to the address. Be sure to include (Street, Road, Avenue, Lane, Apartment #, Floor, Suite #, Business Name, Correct Zip Code, etc).
PLEASE NOTE: UPS now offers a program called My Choice which allows packages to be left at your shipping location without a signature. However this option absolves UPS and Bridge Kitchenware for any loss or theft of the package once it has been delivered. If you are concerned that the package may be stolen, please include a note on your order requiring a signature for delivery.
If there is an error in the shipping address, and UPS is required to correct this error to make the delivery, they will pass an Address Correction fee ($12.00) onto us, and we will in turn pass this fee onto you.
We also offer expedited shipping using UPS 3-Day Select, UPS Second Day Air, as well as UPS Next Day Air. If you require these express methods, please contact our Customer Service Department Customer Service for a quotation of these services. If a quotation is not required, simply enter the Service that you wish or the date that the items "Need to Be There" in the comments section of the order form. Please remember that these services only expedite the shipping time. We try to get all orders placed on Monday-Friday prior to Noon East Coast time, out the same day, but order volume and the weather may prevent this. Also order with SALE ITEMS may take longer, as these orders are filled in the order they are received.
Items that are marked "Oversized" may incur additional shipping charges. If you are not sure if your item is considered oversized, please email our customer service department before placing your order. Also, there are items on our site that we do not ship, they are marked Store P/U and are only available for Customer Pickup.
If your order is to be shipped outside the Continental USA or to an APO address, we can ship it via the US Postal Service International Priority Mail -- provided that they offer Insurance and Return Receipt/Proof of Delivery to your location. We will charge the actual rate charged to us by the US Postal Service, plus $6.00 for handling. Orders to be shipped outside the Continental USA via UPS (any service) can be applicable to a UPS Customs Clearance fee. This fee is the responsibility of the customer and can start at $35.00 USD.
