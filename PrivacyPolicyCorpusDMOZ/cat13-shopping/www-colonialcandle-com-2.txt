(You will likely not be on a SSL until after you have added something to your shopping cart, or when you start checking out). If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from “HTTP” to “https.” Some browsers and firewalls won't permit communication through secure servers.
