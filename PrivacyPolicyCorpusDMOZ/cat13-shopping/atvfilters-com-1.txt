OUR STORY
WHY K&N?
K&N is the home of the original red oiled air filter. In the early 1960s, two motorcycle racers, Ken Johnson and Norm McDonald (K&N), developed a ground-breaking new idea for an oiled air filter. Five decades later, K&N® is still innovating industry-leading filtration technology, and offers outstanding protection for everything from top-fuel dragsters to commuter vehicles across the globe. Thank you for helping us reach 50 years in business!

— Michael from Colorado, Cold Air Intake
Improve Vehicle Performance
K&N premium aftermarket performance products help your car, truck, motorcycle, dirt bike, or ATV perform its best—helping you obtain improved power and an enhanced driving experience from your vehicle. You’ll enjoy increased horsepower, torque, and acceleration—all from the vehicle you already own.
Love Your Car, Love
the Environment
Over 100 million disposable air filters end up in landfills each year. Choosing a washable, reusable product that lasts for the life of your vehicle helps to reduce unnecessary waste.
Protect critical systems
When using a poorly-designed disposable air filter, dust, dirt, and contaminants can make their way into your engine—causing damage and premature wear. In addition, an inefficient oil filter can allow oil contaminants to build up within the engine, reducing its working lifespan. K&N performance protection products are designed to keep contaminants where they belong—out of your engine.
