Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device and to remember a user’s actions and preferences over a period of time.Cookies can be ‘first party’ or ‘third party’ cookies depending on the domain that sets them. In relation to our website, first party cookies are set by us and information is collected and used by us in accordance with the terms of this Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy. Third party cookies are set by third parties and information is collected and used in accordance with their policies.
