The personal information you submit to us will not be shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties in any form, for any purposes, at any time. We will also not disclose your sales history to third parties for any purposes, at any time. Information on items you purchase will not be shared with other businesses or customers, online or off.

We use the latest security and encryption technology to protect your credit card and other information. All orders placed through the shopping cart are made using secure server software (SSL). All your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, is encrypted so that it cannot be read by anyone else on the internet.
We're confident that our security system is the best in the business, and you should be, too. That's why we guarantee that every transaction you make with us will be 100% safe. If unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping with us, you will pay nothing.
