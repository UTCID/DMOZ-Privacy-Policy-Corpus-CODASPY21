Terms and Conditions
By using this website or purchasing any items from PRO Car Studio,
you agree to be bound by all the Terms and Conditions stated below. Do not use this website or place an order if you do not agree to all of these
Terms and Conditions.
For the purpose of this agreement, the company name PRO Car Studio will be taken to mean the company along with its subsidiaries, affiliates,
officers, partners, members, employees, vendors, service providers, and consultants.
Parts Disclaimer (Off-Road Race Parts)
Parts we sell may not conform to road, safety, and/or emissions laws.
UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE, YOU SHOULD ASSUME ANY GIVEN PART IS DESIGNATED ONLY FOR FORMALLY SANCTIONED RACE USE ON A RACING VEHICLE THAT MAY NEVER BE USED
ON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY OR STREET. In other words, PRO Car Studio does
not implicitly or explicitly confirm the legality or safety of using any parts we sell. If you plan on using a certain part for normal street use on public roads, you must research the safety and legality (with reference to federal, state, and local laws)
of that part.
FOR PARTS THAT AFFECT EMISSIONS, WE HAVE AN EMISSIONS WARNING AT THE TOP OF EACH PRODUCT DESCRIPTION; YOU MUST READ THESE IMPORTANT WARNINGS. Certain part types, like some ECU tuners,
are not emissions legal for public road use, and we will have an appropriate emissions warning to reflect that.
For other part types, like intake systems, emissions certifications (i.e. a CARB EO #) are possible. For these part types, if you live in California and your application is not CARB Compliant / Exempt, then you cannot purchase it for public highway or street use. If your application is not CARB Compliant / Exempt and you're shipping to California, our system will let you know on the final checkout page.
Some parts may also not meet the safety requirements originally
set by your vehicle's manufacturer. You, the buyer, acknowledge the ramifications of having parts installed on your vehicle.
Most importantly, ALWAYS wear your safety belt, even on very
short drives! If you have a dedicated race vehicle, we highly recommend installing a 3-point or 5-point harness system.
Indemnification for Damages / Losses / Accidents
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless PRO Car Studio against any incidental or direct damages, losses, injuries, accidents, or additional costs caused by any installing or using any part purchased from it,
or as a result from using any of the information (including pictures) provided over the phone or on its website, social media sites, or other online platforms. If you are unsure about how to install a part, or do not have
the correct tools, we highly recommend having the part installed by a certified, experienced professional.
Product Warranties
All original manufacturer warranties apply (if any). With the sole exception of SiriMoto branded parts (warranty page), PRO Car Studio itself does not offer
specific warranties for any of the products it sells. If a manufacturer's warranty applies, information about it should be
included with your product or available on the manufacturer's website. These warranties do vary, so please read them carefully.
Site Content Disclaimer
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the content and information on this website is provided on an "AS IS" and without any representations, warranties, or conditions of any kind, either express or implied.
Any installation help, guidance, or tips provided by PRO Car Studio should always be doubled checked by a certified automotive professional with experience in the
appropriate area.
Data Privacy
In general, we only use your private personal information as necessary to complete your order(s).
Please see our Privacy and Security page for details.
Returns and Shipping Rules / Procedures
There are other terms, rules, and procedures laid out in our Ordering and Shipping
page and Returns and Cancellations
page. You agree to these terms, rules, and procedures, which are designed to ensure that everything runs as smoothly and quickly as possible.
Pricing and Errors
All prices shown are in U.S. dollars. Any taxes and/or shipping charges are additional and will be shown separately. We try our very best to make sure all our
products are priced correctly; however, an item may slip through the cracks. If an item
is mispriced, we might contact you with an updated price. This will
be done before the order is processed and you will always have the
opportunity to cancel without any penalty.
Our site may also contain informational errors, including incorrect pictures, stock status, and product data. We strive to minimize all of these, but they are
inevitable. If we detect such an error before your order has processed, we will contact you and give you options, including the opportunity to cancel without
any penalty.
Finally, our prices may change from time to time without prior warning. You agree to check all charges (including shipping and taxes) before placing an order.
Conduct Transactions Electronically
In order to purchase from us, you must have a valid email that can be used for order communication and support.
You agree that all of your communication and transactions with us might entirely be conducted electronically at our option, and that any oral conversations might be recorded.
If we conduct non-electronic communication or transactions (such as a phone order), you will still be governed by the remainder of these Terms and Conditions.
You are responsible for printing or making an electronic copy of these Terms and Conditions for your own records.
Limitation of Liability
PRO Car Studio's LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF
A PRODUCT SOLD BY IT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT (INCLUDING TAXES AND SHIPPING), EVEN IF THE DAMAGES ARE CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE.
THE TERM "DAMAGES" ABOVE WILL BE TAKEN TO INCLUDE DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, AND SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS,
EVEN IF WE ARE WARNED IN ADVANCE BY YOU OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH DAMAGES.
Applicable Law and Venue
THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
YOU CONSENT THAT IF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE REQUIRED TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTE, ALL CLAIMS, FILINGS, AND COURT PROCEEDINGS MUST
BE MADE WITH THE VENTURA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT LOCATED IN VENTURA, CALIFORNIA.
Termination of Agreement
If you wish to terminate this agreement, you can simply discontinue your use of this website, provide us written notification, and cease communication and product purchases with us.
PRO Car Studio, reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without notice, to block your access to this site or block you from purchasing products.
Severability
In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable
and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
