K-Swiss Privacy Policy
Cookies and Data Collection
Sharing information with third parties
CCPA Privacy Policy
K-Swiss uses cookies only to allow you to use the kswiss.com website in the most efficient manner. Cookies allow us to enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. By way of example, our use of cookies enable us to “remember” the items in your shopping cart, recognize you when you return to the site, and collect other non-personal identifiable information to analyze visitor behavior such as IP address, browser type and other unique device identifiers.
If you wish, you may have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you may choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Please note, however, that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our website.
We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies, including web beacons, to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our website and about your interaction with our communications, including advertising and e-mails. If you object to web beacons, you may follow the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies. We will still know how many of our e-mails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access devices, but we will not identify you as an individual.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, K-Swiss does not sell, rent or trade any personal information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we share such information with third parties. We may disclose personal information about you to third parties who provide services to us and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We may need to share personal information with these third parties so that they can perform these services; however, we limit the personal information that we give to them and authorize them to use this information only for the purpose of performing those services.
In proceeding with your online order, you agree that both your name and address and those of the delivery name and address (if different) will be checked using third parties such as credit agencies. If you are providing a delivery name and address that is not your own, you must have that person’s permission to give us their personal information and for us to use it for the purposes specified. By providing their name and address, you are telling us that you have their permission.
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with certain business agents and vendors, so that they can provide marketing analysis and advise us on advertising strategies. This information does not identify individual users. From time to time, we also may share non-personal information (such as the number of users who visited the website during a specific time period or who purchased a specific product through the website) with our marketing partners, advertisers and others. This information is usually shared in an aggregated form.
We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; if we have been advised by counsel; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of K-Swiss or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.
As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, sale of all or a portion of our assets or the purchase of online stores or other assets. In such cases, information about customers will likely be transferred. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the privacy policy in effect.
Personal information submitted to or collected through this website may be stored and/or processed in the United States for the purposes described in this privacy policy. By using K-Swiss products and services (including our website), you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
If you would like to opt-out of receiving ads tailored by 3rd party tracking you may choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Please note, however, that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our website.

Personal information for children under 16
If you are under 16 years old, please get the consent of your parent or legal guardian before you give us any personal information about yourself. Your parents or guardian can send us their consent by email, although we may follow up by phone or other means in some circumstances. They will need to give us their name, email address, street address, telephone number, and any other identifying information that we may request. We need this information to verify that they have provided the necessary consent. Your parent or guardian should reach us using the form at https://kswiss.com/pages/contact-us or contact us by using the email address: privacy-compliance@k-swiss.com. You can also contact us by phone at (888) 344-5040 or (855) 201-7134.
IF YOU ARE UNDER 16 YEARS OLD, DO NOT CONTACT US UNTIL AFTER YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN HAS SENT US AN EMAIL CONSENTING TO YOUR CONTACT.
We do not intentionally collect personal data about children under the age of 16. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information about children under the age of 16, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible, except where we are required by applicable law to keep it.
When we know a child is above the age of 16, but considered a minor under applicable law, we will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to using that child's personal information.
How we protect your personal information
Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information is important to us. We have implemented industry standard security technologies including firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-malware protections, multifactor authentication, and monitoring systems to ensure our networks, systems, and data are secure.
Additionally, we employ strong physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to keep your personal information safe, including:
Controlling access to your personal information
We follow a “least privilege” information access model, which means all access must be authorized and limited to the minimum needed for an individual’s role at KSGB.
Monitoring access to your personal information
We regularly review access and activity logs to ensure your personal data is only used according to our Privacy Policy.
Protecting your personal information at rest
All the sensitive information we store is housed within secure facilities and data centers protected by 24x7 access controls, video monitoring, locked storage locations for physical media, strong data encryption, and other techniques appropriate to the sensitivity of that data.
Protecting your data in transit
Communications between your computer and our websites are protected using strong encryption techniques; for example, we use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 security protocol and only use certificates from trusted Certification Authorities.
Regular security testing
We regularly review and test our security controls to find, correct, and prevent weaknesses. Our safeguards are also assessed each year for alignment and compliance with industry best practices and data security requirements like those outlined in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
What happens in case of a data breach?
We will notify you promptly in the event of any breach of your personal data which might expose you to serious risk.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice. You can find the date this Policy was last revised at the top of this page.
Please check this page periodically to ensure you are fully informed about our current privacy practices.
