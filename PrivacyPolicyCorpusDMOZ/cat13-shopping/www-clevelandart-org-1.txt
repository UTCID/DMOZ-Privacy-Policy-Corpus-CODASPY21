Terms and Conditions
The Cleveland Museum of Art (the “CMA”) serves its publics through www.clevelandart.org (including websites accessed via mobile devices as well as downloadable mobile applications, collectively, “Websites”), application program interfaces (“APIs”) and platforms outside CMA where CMA content is hosted, (“Affiliates”) in support of the CMA's mission to create transformative experiences through art, “for the benefit of all the people forever.”  Users accessing these Websites, “APIs,” “Affiliates” or parties external to CMA (collectively, “Third-Parties”), agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions of Use, which CMA may change at any time, without notice, and in its sole discretion. Users are encouraged to visit this page from time to time to review current terms and conditions. The Website, API, and Affiliate sites may contain other proprietary information, notices and limitations, the terms of which must be observed and followed.  You agree that you will not in any way modify, add to, delete from, or tamper with any Content or feature of the Website, API and Affiliates or interfere in any way with their proper functioning.  CMA reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Website, API, and Content in conjunction with Affiliates by anyone who violates these Terms and Conditions of Use or any applicable law or whose conduct is harmful to the interests of CMA or Third Parties.  We may take steps to prohibit access and/or use without prior notice to any such user. With the exception of use regulations as described within these Terms and Conditions , unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and exploitation of the Content is not permitted.  You are authorized to use Content (as defined within these Terms and Conditions), depending on the nature of the Content. All rights not expressly granted within the below Usage Regulations section are explicitly, specifically, and completely reserved. Consult the Image and Data Services Frequently Asked Questions for further information as related to uses defined in these Terms and Conditions. Usage Regulations  (1)  Open Access Content with Creative Commons Zero (CC0)Creative Commons legal tools help entities like CMA legally share knowledge and creativity to build a more accessible and innovative world. Open Access “Content” (images, data, software, and documentation or other information contained in these files or others) is designated with Creative Commons Zero. Creative Commons Zero (CC0) is a public domain dedication tool that, when applied to content, relinquishes all copyright and related rights that the dedicator may have in a work. CC0 Content may be used free-of-charge for both commercial and non-commercial purposes without the prior consent or permission of CMA, including copying, modification, distribution or performance. CMA uses CC0 for two categories of Content. The first is Content in which CMA owns all rights, such as some of the Content its employees create. The second is Content that CMA digitizes and reasonably believes is in the worldwide public domain. When CMA uses CC0 on Content that CMA digitizes and reasonably believes is in the worldwide public domain, it is dedicating any copyright it may have in the digitized version to the public domain—it does not change or affect the underlying copyright status of the Content that has been digitized. CMA has applied CC0 to digitized images of public domain artworks, portions of its metadata, which may, from time-to-time, include a reference or a link to materials as to which CMA owns the copyright.  If CMA includes a reference or link to materials that are not under CC0 and so indicates, then that information is not under CC0 and CMA retains any copyright it has for these materials. CMA makes no statements, representations or warranties as to and disclaims any responsibility for any Third Party’s rights in and to any Content identified as CC0 Content and you are at your own risk for any use of such Content. For more information about CC0, please visit https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain.   (2) Open Access Collection Application Programming Interface (API)   CMA API provides the public with Open Access to a portion of metadata and images in the CMA's collection that, upon reasonable investigation, it believes are in the public domain, but CMA makes no representations or warranties that such metadata or images are in the public domain, and to certain other content that CMA has created, compiled, and presented in which CMA waives all copyright under CC0.
Use of CMA’s API is subject to the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, including without limitation the provisions on Trademarks, Authorized Uses, Security, Privacy, Links to Third Party Sites, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Indemnity, and Applicable Law and Jurisdiction.
CMA’s Privacy Policy applies to CMA's API. CMA will monitor, collect, and store IP addresses, usage information to monitor service load, and analyze and improve the API.
CMA does not provide technical support in connection with CMA API and does not guarantee availability of the service or accuracy of the Content. There may be times when the API is not available due to development, maintenance, or otherwise.
At its sole and absolute discretion CMA may restrict access to or discontinue the API or any functionality associated with the API. CMA may limit the number of transactions a user may send or receive through the API, which may, for example, ensure even performance for all users, or may in the future require access through assigned keys.
Users are encouraged to refresh API data regularly for the most updated Content available; information may change and CMA may add to, delete, or otherwise modify Content.
(3) Copyright, Proprietary Rights and Other Restricted Content  Content not identified as Open Access with Creative Commons legal tools, including Creative Commons Zero (CC0), may be used only for limited non-commercial, educational, and personal use, or for fair use as defined within the applicable United States Copyright Laws or other applicable copyright exceptions and limitations that may apply. Unless otherwise noted, users who wish to download or print any materials authored by CMA from this Website for such uses may do so without CMA’s express permission.  You may not sell any Content not identified as Open Access with Creative Commons Zero (CC0) for any purpose. Anyone wishing to use any of the Content not identified as Open Access with CC0 must request and receive prior written permission from CMA. CMA reviews all written requests and permission may be granted on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of CMA.    Images of CMA’s objects under copyright or with other restrictions may be available through Image and Data Services and the request form. A processing fee of $75 applies for image services. Additional fees may also apply depending on the type and nature of the request. Certain works of art, as well as images of those works of art, may be protected by copyright, trademark, or related interests not owned by CMA. Permissions must be secured from any Third-Party rights holders. The responsibility for ascertaining whether any such rights exist and for obtaining all other necessary permissions remains solely with the user and CMA will have no responsibility in connection with identifying or securing such necessary rights for any Content on the Website.   Reproduction of any images © Artists Rights Society (ARS) or © VAGA is prohibited without written authorization from the following: 536 Broadway, 5th Floor New York, NY 10012 Tel: 212-420-9160 Fax: 212-420-9286 www.arsny.com  (4) CitationWorks designated as CC0 do not require attribution or citation. Copyrighted content, content with proprietary rights, or that is otherwise restricted for limited non-commercial, educational, and personal uses should be cited including the URL “www.ClevelandArt.org” in addition to all copyright and other proprietary notices contained on the materials.
