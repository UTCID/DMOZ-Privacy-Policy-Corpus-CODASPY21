Privacy Policy
At Grounds for Change, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect about you to process your order and communicate with our opt-in mailing list members only. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
How do we protect customer information?
When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection with your Web browser encrypts the information you input before it is sent to the Web server. We then retrieve all orders using an encrypted SSL connection, ensuring the safety of your personal and credit card information. We do not warehouse credit card numbers on our server and all customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
Will we disclose the information to outside parties?
Grounds for Change will never sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to others. This information is for our private records only.
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Grounds for Change.
