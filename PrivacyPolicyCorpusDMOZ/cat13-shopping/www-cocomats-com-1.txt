Privacy Policy
CocoMats.com collects customer information when you make a purchase or voluntarily sign up for our email newsletter. We use this information to process orders, enhance our customer's shopping experience, and communicate with our customers about products, services, and promotions. We do not share the information you provide us online with any outside company or third party. When you place an order at CocoMats.com, we collect your name, billing address, mailing address, IP address, phone number, credit card information, and any information you supply voluntarily. While we collect your credit card information for your order, your credit card information is not saved after your order is processed. We collect your email address when you order from our website for transactional purposes which you cannot opt-out of. This email address will only be used for order confirmation, shipping confirmation, invoices, or any necessary email messages needed to fulfill your order. CocoMats.com maintains a record of your product interests and purchases to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. We also monitor site use and traffic patterns through to improve our web site design and the products and services we offer.
Your Rights
At any point you have the right to request a copy of any information we hold on yourself. You may request to update this information. You may request that we no longer contact you. You may request that we delete this information.
Use Of Cookies
A "cookie" is a small piece of information that many web sites use to help make shopping online easier. This information is stored on your computer's hard drive. CocoMats.com does not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. When you visit the CocoMats.com Web site, your cookie helps us keep track of your shopping preferences. If you choose to register with us, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. Your cookie also assists us in keeping track of your shopping cart. If you request to receive emails from CocoMats.com, your cookie helps us deliver messages that we think might be of interest to you.
Security
Protecting your order information is our priority. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than CocoMats.com Online. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser: When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection.

The CocoMats.com Web site may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These web sites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the web sites. CocoMats.com has no responsibility for linked web sites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.
