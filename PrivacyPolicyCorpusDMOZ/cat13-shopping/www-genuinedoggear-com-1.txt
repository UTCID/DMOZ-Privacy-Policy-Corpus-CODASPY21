Sylvan & Sons/Genuine Dog Gear Privacy Policy Protecting your privacy is a top priority to us. Here's how we collect, use and protect any personal, business or data information you provide to us via our web site, email, telephone, fax or mail.
What We Collect. While visiting our standard web site (noted in your browser address as pages ending in .html) information is stored in a log file for the purpose of analyzing what pages are accessed, which files are downloaded, and what errors occur. We review which top domain addresses visit our site. This process does not collect any personal information about you or your computer.
When you complete any form on our site, your information is written to a secure file. When you shop our online store, a SESSION ID tracks movements and your IP address is stored for authentication and verification reasons only.
This is standard in all shopping cart programs. Your credit card information is stored securely via GeoTrust SSL, in a different location than your contact information, and is removed from the server when transactions are complete. Our online store uses cookies to identify you and your movement through our store. A cookie is a small file stored on your computer, which expires by a certain date. Our cookies do not track your movement throughout the Internet and do not, ever, send us information about you when you are not on our site.
What We Do With It.
After you shop with us, your name, address, telephone number and email, along with your order are kept on file for two reasons:
To reference should you have questions regarding your order;
To notify you of any special offers or new information we've posted on our sites.
This information is never sold, traded or distributed to others. When you register for updates about our site, we store your name and email address in a secure area. This information is used only to send you updates about our site... We do not distribute this information to anyone else.
What You Can Do.
You have the option to opt-out of any notification altogether, and be removed from our email list. Though we cannot remove your ordering information, you may request to be removed from product update notifications. Each email includes a special opt-out link you can click. It is our policy to immediately respond to these requests.
If You Have Questions. If you have questions about our privacy policy, or have a dispute, please email us. You may also contact us by other means. From time to time, we may make changes to this policy. Those changes will be reflected on this page.
