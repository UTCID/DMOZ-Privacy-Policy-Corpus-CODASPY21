Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

Third-party service providers, as well as Conn’s HomePlus, may collect personally identifiable information through cookies, web beacons and other storage technologies about your online behavior throughout time, as well as across multiple websites and services.
