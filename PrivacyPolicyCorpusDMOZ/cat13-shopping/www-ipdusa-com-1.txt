YOU SHALL COOPERATE AS FULLY AS REASONABLY REQUIRED IN THE DEFENSE OF ANY SUCH CLAIM.
MISCELLANEOUS
Governing Law; Limitations; Venue. Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, these Agreements are subject to the law of the State of Oregon, United States, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and IPD agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Portland, Oregon to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that arises in connection with these Agreements.
If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also apply to you:
You and IPD agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the IPD Service or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and IPD are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the termination of your IPD account. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by these Agreements, and as administered by the AAA. You and IPD agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and IPD agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights of IPD, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of the IPD products, services, and Information are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and IPD agree that these claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by courts of competent jurisdiction in Portland, Oregon, and that applicable Oregon and/or Federal law shall govern, without regard to choice of law principles, and further you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts with respect to any such dispute.
YOU AND IPD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.
Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
Return Policies; Exchanges. IPD's return policy can be found at https://www.ipdusa.com/faq.asp?FAQ_ID=2 and you agree to those terms. At IPD's discretion, credit for partial returns may be less than invoice or individual component prices due to bundled or promotional pricing.
Changed or Discontinued Product. IPD's policy is one of ongoing update and revision. IPD may, from time to time, revise and discontinue Product and/or Information at any time without notice to you and this may affect information saved in your online "cart." IPD will ship Product that has the functionality and performance of the Product ordered, but changes between what is shipped and what is described in a specification sheet or catalog are possible.
Assignments. You may not assign any of your rights, obligations, privileges, or performance hereunder without the prior written consent of IPD. Any assignment other than as provided for in this paragraph shall be null and void.
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful or unenforceable in any respect, the court shall reform such provision so as to render it enforceable (or, if it is not possible to reform such provision so as to make it enforceable, then delete such provision); and, as so reformed or modified, fully enforce this Agreement.
Notices.
Official correspondence must be sent via certified mail to:
IPD 11744 NE Ainsworth Circle Portland, OR 97220 USA
U.S. Government Restricted Rights. The materials on the Website are provided with "RESTRICTED RIGHTS." Use, duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in applicable laws and regulations. Use of the materials by the Government constitutes acknowledgement of IPD's proprietary rights in them.
Termination. IPD may terminate or suspend your use of the Website for any reason. Termination or cancellation of your use of the Website shall not effect any right or relief to which IPD may be entitled, at law or in equity. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to you will terminate and revert to IPD.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement is complete and effective at the time you begin use of the Website. With the possible exception of separate, additional licenses for the use of a particular IPD product or service offering, THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND NO OTHER AGREEMENT, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXISTS BETWEEN YOU AND IPD.
