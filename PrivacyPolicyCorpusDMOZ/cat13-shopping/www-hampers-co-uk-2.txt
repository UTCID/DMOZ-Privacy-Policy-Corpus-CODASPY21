COOKIES
To improve your experience on our website we also need to collect your cookies. A cookie is a piece of information shared between a website and your computer's hard drive. This is so that the website can remember who you are, e.g. with the login credentials.
We use cookies in the following ways:
- To help us recognize you as a unique visitor, (just a number) when you return to our website. This would technically also allow us to match your preferred interests with specific content in our site. In practice we are not that technically savvy, so unlikely to use cookies  for this purpose.
- To compile anonymous aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our website. This helps us improve the background of our website.
Two types of cookies may be used on our website. The first are session cookies, which remain in the cookies file of your browser until you leave our site. The second are persistent cookies which remain in the cookie file of your browser for the life of the specific cookie. Most of our web pages also contain electronic images known as Web beacons that allow us to count users who have visited these pages. This helps us to formulate the offerings that we make on our site. Web beacons collect a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page from which the web beacon originates.
Disabling/Enabling cookies
You can accept or decline the use of cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. Please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our website. To find out more on how to disable or enable cookies visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
A popup will appear the first time you visit our website, asking you for permission to collect your cookies. Once approved, we consider you allow us using you cookies till further request.
LEGITIMATE INTEREST
In some situations, we can use your data to reach our legitimate goals in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests, like sending you personalised offers following your purchase, and using your address details to send you promotional material that might interest you.
