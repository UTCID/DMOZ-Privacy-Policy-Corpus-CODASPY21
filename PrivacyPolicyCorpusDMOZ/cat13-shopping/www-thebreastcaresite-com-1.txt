Overview
There are several types of breast cancer, though some are very rare. The most common form in a woman’s lobules (the part of the breast where milk develops) or in the ducts (the tiny tubes that deliver milk to the nipple). Cancer that remains in its place of origin, either in the ducts or the lobules, is considered “in situ,” or “in place.” Invasive cancer occurs when the malignant cells break through the ducts or lobules and spread to the surrounding breast tissue and/or the lymph system and other parts of the body.

Overview
It’s important to start exercising as soon as possible, preferably before or during the course of adjuvant treatment.
The sooner you start, the less likely you are to get stuck in the vicious cycle of feeling fatigued, not exercising, feeling more fatigued and even less willing to exercise, and so on.
Once you start, you will probably find yourself eager and motivated to continue.
Studies found that breast cancer survivors who were instructed to exercise were very motivated to do so and were able to stick with the program.

Breast cancer is no laughing matter.
But it could matter if you laugh.
Bill Cosby once said “Through humor, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers. And once you find laughter, no matter how painful your situation might be, you can survive it.”
Women surviving breast cancer can know with comfort - life is what you make it.
