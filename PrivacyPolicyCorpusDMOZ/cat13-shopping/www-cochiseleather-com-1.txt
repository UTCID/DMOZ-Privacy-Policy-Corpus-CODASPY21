Price/Product Information
We make every attempt to avoid errors in pricing and product information.  If a mistake does occur, we reserve the right to correct it and we apologize for any inconvenience it may cause.  We also reserve the right to substitute conchos and buckles on our products when they are no longer available to us.
Privacy Policy
Our privacy policy is quite simple and straightforward.    We will never send you emails and/or mailings other than in connection with your order unless you have requested otherwise.  When you order from us all of your information is kept strictly confidential and is shared with no one.
We will never sell your name or mailing address.  Our policy is when you order from us all information is kept confidential.
Our customers are very important to us and we treat them as we expect to be treated by others.
We will sometimes call you with a question on your order, if you DO NOT want to be contacted in this method please let us know.  However, we would like to emphasize that it is the easiest way for David LaFlair to confirm a question on your custom order so their is no delay on it's construction and delivery.  Many of our items are truly customized and he needs to talk to you personally to make sure that everything is correctly measured.
Guarantee
We guarantee our workmanship and quality of materials.  Leather naturally has imperfections resulting from injury to the animal or conditions of nature.  In such cases, we will avoid using these pieces or use the particular scar (such as brand marks) to enhance the character of the product.  In all events, our policy is to give you a finished piece of which you can be proud.  Since leather does not always dye uniformly, and hides can differ in their ability to absorb dye, some colors may not be exactly as shown on the website.
Price/Product Information
We make every attempt to avoid errors in pricing and product information.  If a mistake does occur, we reserve the right to correct it and we apologize for any inconvenience it may cause.
Product Modification
We reserve the right to add or subtract bullet loops on gunbelts and any other items that may have bullet loops to provide "balance" on the product.
