For our business purposes, such as: to operate and improve upon our business and lawful business activities; to maintain our programs, accounts, and records; for research; to determine your satisfaction with our products and services; to detect and prevent fraud or misuse of our services; and for any other business purpose that is permitted by law;

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may collect your name and email address, as well as other data such as your phone number and ZIP code. We use this data to contact you with relevant offers and follow-ups when necessary. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, or contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. Participation is completely voluntary. Information collected may be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as set forth in the applicable terms or official rules, including without limitation to notify the winners and award prizes, and file winners' information as required by law.

You can also accept or decline cookies through your browser settings. To learn more, please look at the cookie settings available in your specific web browser(s)
Who Else Has Access to Data You Provide to HerRoom:
Andra Group does not sell, rent or give away your personal data to anyone. We do supply data for the purpose of billing and shipping your order. In other words, we get approval from the credit card company when you make a charge and we give the shipper (such as but not limited to UPS, DHL and FedEx) your address.
The other form of third party data that may be used is personally identifiable data submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them or if you complete a "tell a friend" form on our site, you're sharing third party data.
Additionally, we may release account data when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to 1.) comply with the law, 2.) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or 3.) protect the rights, property, or safety of Andra Group LP and our users, or others.

If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us regarding special promotions or offers you may click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email. As an alternative to unsubscribing, you also have the ability to "opt-down" to receive a limited number of promotional emails per week. Please be sure that if you use more than one email address to shop with us, send your messages from each email account you use. You may not opt-out of transactional or administrative e-mails, for example e-mails about your account, transactions or policy changes for your account.
How We're Protecting Your Privacy:
Our Properties have security measures in place to protect from the loss, misuse and alteration of data under our control. Our servers use encrypted methods for those pages which contain personally identifiable data, including your credit card and address. We routinely and zealously monitor and upgrade our security systems to ensure that we use the best security technology available.
We at Andra Group LP are committed to a safe and secure web experience for our visitors. If, you have any additional questions or concerns contact us.
Tracking Services:
In addition to any data you voluntarily submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking services such as cookies, web beacons, HTML5, embedded scripts, e-tags, cached browsers/web logs to automatically (or passively) collect certain data from your device whenever you visit or interact with our properties or third-party Properties. This data may include your device ID, the version and type of internet browser you use, and your operating system (OS).
We may also collect your password data when you login to our properties, as well as device and connection data. During visits, these tools may be used to collect and measure session data, including page response times, download errors, time spent on site and page interaction data. Certain features of our services are only available through the use of tracking services. You may encounter tracking services/cookies from our third-party service providers that we have allowed on our services to assist us with various aspects of our operations and services.
We use Google to serve first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Services. To learn about Google Analyticsâ€™ current available opt-outs for the web, click here. To learn more about how Google uses cookies in interest based advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy located here. You can opt-out of receiving interest based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you by clicking here.
Please be aware that if you choose to block certain cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those cookie-dependent features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. Tracking services are used for a variety of purposes, including administration, preventing fraudulent site and/or purchase activity, improving security, and allowing you to use our properties. Tracking services may also be used to analyze the performance of our properties, including as part of our analytic processes to enhance content available on our properties. Tracking services may also be used to tell us whether you are a new or returning customer and help us analyze features in which you may have the greatest interest. Tracking services may also be used to deliver content and ads relevant to your interests on our properties and third-party Properties based on how you engage with our advertisements or content, as well as to track the content you access.
Location Functionality:
Data acquired by your use of our properties may be integrated with data from third-party platforms to identify your location. If your location services are enabled, Andra Group may collect location data intermittently as you use our properties. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services within the device settings.
Targeted Advertising — Interest-Based Advertising:
We may use cookies and trackers to collect data about your visits across our properties and third-party Properties. Data may be sent from additional sources to serve targeted ads. In the process of serving our ads, we utilize third party advertising platforms including ad networks, ad servers, analytics providers, data exchanges and more. The third parties may utilize cookies and other tracking techniques to send advertisements and links that appear on our properties directly to your devices. Third party tools may also throttle the number of instances of ads you see and help measure the performance of our marketing campaigns. In addition, third parties may use data gathered from your visits to our properties to deliver targeted, interest-based ads to you on external Properties and apps.
A few of the ad service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single opt-out location for disabling ad targeting. If you opt out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of our properties and third-party Properties. If you need more info on advertiser use of tracking services and your option to opt out, visit networkadvertising.org. If you would like to learn about how interest-based data is collected, if the services we use belong to an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or you would just like to know your choices about restricting your data's usage, go to aboutads.info. Some mobile devices allow you to regulate the use of your data to deliver interest-based ads on your mobile device. Check the settings on your specific device to see which options are available to you.
Please note that the opt out option is cookie-based and will only work on the exact computer, mobile app or browser on which the opt out is applied. You may also decline or accept cookies in your browser settings. For more information, take a look at the browser settings on your web browser for cookies.

Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal data is used or processed.
Right to Object. This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal data is processed.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account data. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us.
