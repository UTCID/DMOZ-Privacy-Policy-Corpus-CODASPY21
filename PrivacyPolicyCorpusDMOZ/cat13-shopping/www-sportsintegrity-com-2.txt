The Website is operated by SportsIntegrity.Com LLC. ("SportsIntegrity.Com LLC").  When used herein, the terms "we," "us" or "our" includes SportsIntegrity.Com LLC and the SportsIntegrity.Com LLC Entities.
Your use of the Website (and any other feature, content or application offered by the Website) is at all times subject to these Terms of Use, as the same may be modified by us, and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Please read these Terms of Use carefully.
1. Acceptance of Terms of Use. By accessing AND USING THE Website, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use.  FOR EXAMPLE, SECTION 19 contains an arbitration agreement which states that you must arbitrate instead of going to a court before a judge and jury.  If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, YOU MAY not access or use the Website. These Terms of Use may be changed, modified, or altered by us in our sole discretion at any time without prior notice. If we materially change the Terms of Use, we will notify you through a notice, updated Terms of Use on the Website or by email (sent to the email address specified in your account, if any), prior to or upon the change(s) becoming effective.  Accordingly, when you access or use the Website, you should check the date of the Terms of Use and be aware of any changes since the last version.

In order to participate in or use certain other services, programs (including any customer rewards or loyalty program), promotions, discounts, vouchers or coupons that may be run from time to time with respect to the Website ("Offers"), you may be required to agree to additional or different terms and conditions ("Offer Terms"). If there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and any Offer Terms, the Offer Terms shall control and the non-conflicting provisions in these Terms of Use will continue to apply. For example, if you seek to redeem a coupon code on the Website, your redemption of the coupon code is subject to the specific Offer Terms applicable to that code and to the non-conflicting provisions of these Terms of Use. If an Offer does not contain Offer Terms, then only these Terms of Use apply. Under these Terms of Use, unless otherwise prohibited by law, any Offer: (a) is valid only at the website identified in the Offer and at no other store; (b) applies to in-stock merchandise only and not to gift cards or services; (c) is not valid for cash or cash equivalents; (d) is limited to one Offer per person; (e) must be entered at checkout and/or in your account to be redeemed; (f) may not be combined with any other coupons or offers; (g) may only be used once; (h) expires on the date specified in the Offer, or, if none, the later of five years from the date of issue or the date required by applicable law, and (i) cannot be reproduced, modified, sold or traded or used to pay any tax, such as sales tax, or any value added service. In addition, some Offers may be in the form of a voucher or coupon.  If you purchase a voucher with a promotional value beyond the amount paid, you may redeem the voucher for the promotional value until the expiration date, or for the amount paid after the end of the applicable promotional period. We reserve the right to limit, change, or cancel any Offer or associated order, without prior notice, even after you have attempted to redeem the Offer or placed your associated order. By using or participating in an Offer, you indicate your acceptance of all applicable terms and conditions, including these Terms of Use and the Offer Terms, if applicable.
