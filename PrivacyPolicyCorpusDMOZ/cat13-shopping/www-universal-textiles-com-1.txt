We do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party including but not limited to your name, address, email address or any payment information.
However, we share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you, as set out in this statement:
Companies essential to our operations to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers, and delivery companies
Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners, website hosts and CRM providers who help us run our business
Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies
Companies approved by you, such as social media sites
We may provide third parties with aggregated but anonymised information and analytics about our customers and, before we do so, we will make sure that it does not identify you and complies with all relevant data transfer security protocols.

Where you have provided explicit authorisation to do so, from time to time we'll send you marketing messages via email, SMS, mail or other electronic devices/means to keep you aware of what we're up to and to help you see and find our products.
You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. You can do this:

By contacting dataprotection@universal-textiles.com
Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don't receive further marketing messages. Please note that it might take a few days for all our systems to be updated, so you might get messages from us while we process your request.
Stopping marketing messages will not stop service communications (such as order updates)
