In these areas we may ask for your name, address, email address, credit card and other information needed to complete your order or fulfill your request.
In order to make improvements to our site, we may use this information to help show us how customers use the site.
What information we do not collect
We do not gather sensitive personal data (e.g. health, genetic, biometric data; racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual orientation, and criminal convictions). We expressly request that you do not provide any such sensitive data to us. Additionally, our services are not directed to children under 13. If you learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without consent, please contact us.
How we use the information we collect
We have a strong tradition of providing excellent customer service. Our goal is to bring this tradition to the online environment by providing a listing of our products and services.
The information we gather when you visit our site may be used in aggregate to improve the products and services we offer you. In the end, we hope this information will help us tailor our communications so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don’t. This is a means of receiving feedback from our customers, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments. We read every email we receive.
Please note that we do not sell or share email addresses with other companies.
What information we do not share with others
We do not share, sell or trade email addresses, information collected as part of a survey or specific details about you or your household. We do not contribute to or participate in shared or cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your personal information. We do not release credit card or financial information for use by other companies. For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server.

Requesting: You may request a copy of any data we hold about you. Upon request, we will provide a relevant digital file containing the personal data we hold on record about you.
Correcting: The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you change email address, or if any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please contact us so we may correct our records.
Deleting: You have the right to request erasure of your personal information. Unless there is a compelling reason for the data not to be erased (for example, if we need to use that data to fulfil our contractual or legal obligations), your personal data will be deleted on request.
