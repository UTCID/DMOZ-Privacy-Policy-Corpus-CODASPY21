Once you have selected an item and are ready to purchase, when you select Add to Cart your payment and order details are transferred by secure connection to PayPal our payment gateway. This means that the information is encrypted and cannot be read by anyone other than Paypal. You can see that the pages are secure because the address in the address bar changes from being http:// to https//. You will also see a padlock symbol or key in the bottom bar of your browser.
PayPal Information Security: Paypal is committed to handling customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card and bank account information are stored only in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. PayPal maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic information.
