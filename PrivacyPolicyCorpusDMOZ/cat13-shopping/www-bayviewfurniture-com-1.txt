Others With Whom We Share Your Information.
The Bayview Furniture Company: All of the above information that we collect, as described
above, may be shared among all Bayview Furniture entities: stores, website and private sales.
Service Providers: We also may disclose information to outside companies that
help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work
with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b)
assist us in distributing emails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data
collection; (d) provide us storage and analysis; (d) provide fraud prevention; and
(e) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in our agreements with them.
Other Companies: We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.
Business Transitions: We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that Bayview Furniture or one of its properties, affiliates, or subsidiaries goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Bayview Furniture to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.
Bayview Furniture specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its websites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.
Compliance with Law: We may provide access to information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our legal liability, and to protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this website or the public.
Bayview Furniture partners with advertising companies to place our advertising on publisher websites on the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This technology involves the use of third party cookies that allow them to develop personalized advertising so that it directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you. You may choose to opt-out of this service we have with our third-party advertising partner. We may also use Bayview Furniture cookies to provide similar enhanced online marketing to you based on your interests and preferences. You may also choose to opt out of these enhanced online marketing ads.
Your Choices Regarding Use Of The Information We Collect
You have several choices regarding our handling of your nonpublic personally identifiable information.
Direct Mail or Telephone Marketing: If you shop at the Bayview Furniture or Private Sales stores and wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail or telemarketing calls, please either write to Bayview Furniture Customer Care at 2181 E Pass Rd, Gulfport, MS 39507. If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address, and state one of the following:
"NO MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by mail);
"NO PHONE OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by phone);
"NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive either).
Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering
(sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive
some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified
marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us
time to carry out your request.

information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third
parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify
the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and
affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you
are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a
written request to the following address: Bayview Furniture Customer Care, 2181 E Pass Rd, Gulfport, MS 39507. Please allow 30 days for a response.
