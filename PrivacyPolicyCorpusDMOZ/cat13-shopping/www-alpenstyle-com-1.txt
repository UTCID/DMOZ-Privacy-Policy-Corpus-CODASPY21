If a product is not in stock when you place your order,

will be available. Anticipated delivery dates are
dependent on our suppliers and other factors beyond

Card
The checkout allows you to securely pay with your

Shipping
Info
Orders will be shipped Monday - Friday (except
holidays). All orders placed after 2 pm PST will be
shipped the following business day. We use the
following shipping options: Our experience has shown
that the majority of all orders shipped to the east
coast arrive within3-5 days of shipping.
Due to the various AlpenStyle warehouse
locations throughout the
United States
and preferential rates by distributors , some shipping
carriers may be changed from the originally specified
order (i.e. all Skjaeveland and Vrikke orders ship Fed
Ex, Geiger ground orders ship UPS ground only, never
Fed Ex ground).
We do not mark up carrier rates nor do we believe in
charging for handling shipments. For both Fed Ex and
UPS we use the current rate tables for either carrier
to determine shipping costs to your delivery address,
based on the carrier and type of delivery you choose.
FOB Origin Freight Collect
The buyer assumes title and control of the goods the moment the carrier signs the bill of lading. The buyer assumes risk of transportation and is entitled to route the shipment. The buyer is responsible for filing claims for loss or damage. Buyer pays and bears freight charges.

your chest/bust, keeping the tape straight across
your back.

Measure
around the base of your neck. Pull the tape tight
enough for a snug but comfortable fit.

the elbow and measure from the center of the neck
(backside) to elbow and down to wrist.

Measure
around the fullest part of the hips, usually about
