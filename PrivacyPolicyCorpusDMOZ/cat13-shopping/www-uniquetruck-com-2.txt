Unique Truck Equipment has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a secure server software SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.
You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.

When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf (i.e. packaging, mailing, shipping, customer reviews). We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
