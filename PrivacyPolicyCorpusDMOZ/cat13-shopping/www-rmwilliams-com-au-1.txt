BOOT REPAIR CONDITIONS
*This service is only available in Australia
R.M.Williams boots are constructed in such a manner that under normal wear and tear they can be repaired several times in their lifetime. But like any good product, if not properly cared for, irreparable and often unseen damage can occur which is not evident until the boots are stripped down for repair.
During the stripping process it may be discovered that additional work is required to enable the original repair request to be carried out. If this is found to be the case, appropriate costs may be applied. R.M.Williams Pty. Ltd. accept these boots for repair under the condition that no responsibility will be taken where the boots are found after stripping to be incapable of repair. If this occurs your boots will be returned to you in the stripped state, and a full refund will be applied. You have 2 months (60 days) after purchase to return your boots to the R.M. Williams boot room for repairs to be made otherwise the purchase is void. To R.M.Williams Pty Ltd, I have read the above conditions under which you accept my boot for repair, upon payment of this repair product you agree to be bound by the above conditions.
THANK YOU for trusting us with the repairs to your R.M.Williams boots. In doing so you have availed yourself of the skills practised by the craftsmen and women in our boot factory and the quality of the materials we use in the making of all new boots. The success of the repairs carried out on your boots will depend as it always does, whether they are new or old boots, on the care and maintenance you continue to give them.
