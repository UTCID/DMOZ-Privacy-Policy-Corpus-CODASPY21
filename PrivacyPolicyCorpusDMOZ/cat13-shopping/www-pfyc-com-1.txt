PFYC - Terms of Use
PFYC Website Terms of Use Last Updated: October 1, 2015
AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND PartsForYourCar.com ("PFYC")
Note to Children: YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OLD TO REGISTER FOR SERVICES OR TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS ON THIS
SITE OR TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF THROUGH THIS SITE. REGISTRATION FOR SERVICES OR THE PURCHASE
OF PRODUCTS BY ANY PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 16 IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
The PFYC Site is made up of various Web sites and Web pages operated by PFYC, 11800 Rt 45, Salem OH 44460 (collectively, the "PFYC Sites"). This Terms of Use applies to the PFYC Sites and does not
apply to the content of third parties.
The PFYC Sites are offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions,
and notices contained herein. Your use of the PFYC Sites constitutes your agreement to all such terms,
conditions, notices and all applicable laws. PFYC reserves the right to change the Terms of Use at any time
without prior notice and by using the PFYC Sites subsequent to any revision of the Terms of Use, you agree to be
bound by such changes.
Accounts and Passwords.
If a particular PFYC Site, or any product or service offered on any PFYC Site ("Service" and collectively
"Services", and collectively "PFYC Sites/Services") requires you to open an account, you must complete the
registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the
applicable registration form. You then will choose a password and a user name. You are entirely responsible
for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible
for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify PFYC immediately of any
unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. PFYC will not be liable for any loss that
you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your
knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by PFYC or another party due to someone
else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else's account at any time, without the
permission of the account holder.
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
Your use of the PFYC Sites is at your own risk. While PFYC uses reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy,
correctness and reliability of the PFYC Sites' content, we make no representations or warranties as to the
accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any information or material on the sites. Prices and
availability are subject to change without notice. Further, PFYC makes no representation of any kind that
all content, materials and services on the PFYC Sites are appropriate or available for use in all geographic
locations, especially some locations outside the United States, and accessing such from certain locations may
be illegal and prohibited. Those accessing the PFYC Sites from such locations act on their own initiative
and we are not responsible for their compliance with applicable laws.
Products you purchase on the PFYC Sites may be accompanied by a manufacturer's warranty. This is your only
warranty with respect to the products. Except as otherwise specifically provided, PFYC does not itself
warrant any of the products offered for sale on the PFYC Sites. PFYC is not responsible for any damage
to your vehicle arising from any products sold on the PFYC Sites.
How products affect your new vehicle warranty. Parts offered for sale on the PFYC Sites may impact your
new vehicle warranty. It is generally illegal for a dealership to void your warranty simply because you
have made modifications to your vehicle. It is the dealerships responsibility to prove that your modification
directly caused or affected the failure. However, some dealerships are more performance-oriented and willing
to work with customers on these issues. You should consult with your local dealership regarding their
warranty policies. If you have other questions, or just want a second opinion, we suggest you also consult
with Pontiac at 800-PMCARES. For further information and more details regarding this law, check out the following links:

ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES AND/OR OTHER HARMFUL MATERIALS. IF YOUR USE OF THE PFYC SITES OR THE CONTENT
RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, PFYC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.
THE SITE, THE PRODUCTS AND THE CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
PFYC, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. PFYC MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE CONTENT,
SERVICES, TEXT, GRAPHICS, AND/OR LINKS APPEARING ON THE SITE.
Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PFYC NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, CONTENT
PROVIDERS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, ARISING FROM THE
USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PFYC SITES OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED THROUGH
THE PFYC SITES, EVEN IF PFYC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
REMEDY: IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PFYC SITES, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE
TO CEASE USING THE PFYC SITES. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH A PRODUCT PURCHASED THROUGH A PFYC SITE, YOUR
