From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to submit a review of a product offered on this Site.

All information you submit to a Third Party Operator will be subject to the privacy policies, procedures and practices of the Third Party Operator.

What Are "Cookies" and How Are They Used?
To enhance your experience with the Site, we use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place on your computer to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on the Site. We also may use cookies to display to you products, programs, or services that you may find of particular interest. We may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs" or "pixel tags") to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used in conjunction with cookies that conform to our cookie policy.
Third parties present on the Site, such as advertisers, may also place cookies on your browser.
If you wish to prevent cookies from being accepted, most Internet browsers allow you to do so- e.g., in Internet Explorer, click “Tools,” then “Internet Options” and adjust your cookie settings on the “Privacy” tab (e.g.: the “Block All Cookies” setting blocks all future cookies and renders all existing cookies unreadable by websites). For more information, please check your browser's technical information.
Preventing your browser from accepting cookies may disable or interfere with shopping features on our sites or other sites that you may visit.
