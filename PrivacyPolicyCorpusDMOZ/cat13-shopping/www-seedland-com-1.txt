Email Security
We promise to never sell your email address to a third
party. We respect your privacy and the reason you placed your trust in Seedland,
Inc. by giving us your email address.  Nor do we sell your
addresses to any other companies.  We may at times send you
catalog or special sale information only related to our
company.  You can ask to be excluded from those mailings
should you desire.
Web Shopping Security
Seedland, Inc. maintains a secure server environment -
transmitting all important data in encrypted form.  Security at both our server
location and our sales/shipping location is under strict guidelines as to authorized
access and availability.  We understand the need to protect your confidential data
entrusted to our company.
ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
SEEDLAND.COM
A Secure Store
To further provide increased
security, all credit card data is downloaded and deleted from
our secure server daily.  Once downloaded, this information
is then stored in a separate computer, totally off-line from the
Internet so as to never allow for the chance of a hacker or
other individual securing your data from our firm.  This does
require you to enter your credit card information every time you
make a purchase, but we feel this small inconvenience is worth the
improved security of this method.
Shopping
& Credit Card Security
Seedland uses a secure server (SSL) backed by a Thawte SSL Server
Certificate.  This certificate uses the latest Thwarte Security
Certificate.  If you are using Netscape 4 or higher, or IE
4 or higher, then you should have no problems.
By using a certificate from Thawte coupled with our
SSL Secure site, Seedland, Inc. can communicate securely with our web customers. SSL
protects client communications, including credit card orders, sensitive personal
information, and ensures that foreign hackers do not detect passwords. SSL security makes
eavesdropping on web traffic almost impossible.
Trophyhunter.com uses Verisign
server Certificates.
Your credit card
information is not maintained on our online
store database.  When your order is processed (daily) all credit card
information (number / name) is removed from any online
access.  This ensures a higher standard of security by preventing or minimizing the chances
of this data being stolen by a third party.  The only
information we maintain online for your convenience
is your shipping information should you wish to create an online
account.  Credit card information must be re-submitted each
time a purchase is desired.
