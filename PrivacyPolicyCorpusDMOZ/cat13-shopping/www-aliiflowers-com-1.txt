Hawaiian Flowers, Leis and Gifts – Terms and ConditionsFragrant Hawaiian Leis – Please Read Before OrderingWe classify certain fragrant Hawaiian leis as ‘sensitive’ due to the nature of their flowers. FedEx and UPS will not allow us to insure these leis.These include leis made entirely or partially with:Micronesian ginger PlumeriaTuberoseAlii Flowers makes every reasonable best effort to pack sensitive leis with extra care and packaging material to preserve them during shipping.Sensitive leis are shipped by FedEx Priority which is overnight to inter-island, California and many west coast locations. Other areas are two business days.Late arriving orders may be shipped UPS which is two days to states outside Hawaii and overnight inter-island.Alii Flowers will guarantee the freshness of sensitive leis sent overnight if a signature is obtained at delivery.If your order is being sent to an area with two day shipping only you are ordering at your own risk. Your sensitive lei is not guaranteed and will not be refunded if it arrives in poor condition. Condition problems typically present with browning on white flowers or softening of the bloom. In any case if your lei arrives in unsatisfactory condition please let us know. In some cases we may have recourse with the shipping company.To verify shipping times please contact us with your destination zip code. You can also contact Federal Express directly. The origin zip code for sensitive leis is  96701.Our lei makers take great pride in using the freshest available flowers. Our packers and shippers have worked with these remarkable Hawaiian flowers for years and use industry best practices to insure they arrive in good condition. However, on rare occasions a box with a sensitive lei may be exposed during shipping to temperatures that might damage the lei. For this reason Alii Hawaiian Tropical Flowers cannot guarantee sensitive leis that require two day or more ship times.Advance Order LeisSome leis may require a three to seven day advance order. This is in advance of the shipping date, not the arrival date.This is due to the types of flowers needed and skill to create the lei. Advance order times are clearly indicated in the relevant product descriptions.Orders with delivery dates not attainable due to late ordering may be cancelled or delayed.General Terms and ConditionsProducts shown on our website are available for shipping to all 50 US states with the following exceptions: maile – not sent to California; Song of India foliage – not sent to Arizona.Some flowers may be sent in bud for a longer life.Most standard dendrobium will be double spike unless limited by weather, in which case single spike plants may be sent. This sometimes happens in the winter months.Some flowers may not be available at the time you place your order. This is due to seasonality or high demand. In those cases we will substitute a comparable flower with an equal or higher cost unless your order selects our ‘No Substitutions’ option when placed.Hawaiian flower assortments are not sent arranged.
