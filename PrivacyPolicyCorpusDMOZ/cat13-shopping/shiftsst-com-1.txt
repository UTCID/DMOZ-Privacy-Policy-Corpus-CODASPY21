Privacy Statement
By using the power and technology of the Internet, Silver Sport Transmissions (SST) is able to exchange information with our customers and vendors in innovative, personalized and efficient ways. We rely on our customers to provide basic data, including mailing and email addresses and information needed to complete purchasing transactions. In addition, SST may provide online forums and surveys for customers and vendors to answer questions and encourage open dialog on topics relevant to our products and services.
In order to maintain clear standards of privacy and security with the information we are provided, SST has established the following Principles of Privacy for our organization and customers.
Our Principles of Privacy:
We do not, and will not sell or provide our secure, proprietary database of customers to any outside parties.
Personal information, including the name and contact information for individual customers, is private to SST.
When you place orders, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.
Users may choose, at their sole discretion, to participate in online forums and surveys. Any personal or private information that such users choose to disclose in online forums and surveys is considered to be public information, and SST expressly disclaims all responsibility for its privacy or protection.
In addition, SST may at its discretion uses cookies to authenticate users. We use cookies to make sure our users are who they say they are.
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Your browser needs to accept these cookies for the site to function properly.
If for some reason you believe SST has not adhered to these principles, please notify us and we will use all reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly.
