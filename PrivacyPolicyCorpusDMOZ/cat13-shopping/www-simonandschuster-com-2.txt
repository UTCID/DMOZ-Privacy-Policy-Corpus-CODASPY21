Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify S&S's acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of S&S's offer to sell. S&S reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.

We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Sites or any portion of the Sites, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that we provide.

Please allow thirty days for S&S to address your complaint prior to filing arbitration as set forth below.
Except for disputes relating to the infringement of your or our intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, copyright and patents) or where S&S is seeking a preliminary injunction (“Excluded Disputes”), you agree that all disputes between you and S&S (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to these Terms or your use of the Sites, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules. Neither you nor S&S will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and, where consistent, New York law. The arbitration will be conducted in New York, NY, in the English language by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s Rules. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either S&S or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. At your election, desktop or telephone arbitration, if available, can be used for claims of less than $10,000. In-person arbitration hearings will be conducted at the place of your residence at the time the dispute is submitted to arbitration. S&S will pay the costs for arbitration (not including your attorney’s fees) for claims under $5,000 where you are successful. In all other cases, you will bear 50% of the cost of any arbitration. In all cases, you alone will be responsible for your attorney's fees. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrators will not have authority to award punitive or exemplary damages. You agree that any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms or the Excluded Disputes will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York, NY and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.
MISCELLANEOUS
The failure of S&S to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit S&S's rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. No waiver by S&S of any of these Terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of S&S. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms. S&S may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without any notice to you. Terms may not be assigned by you without S&S's prior written consent. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Section titles are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against S&S by virtue of S&S having drafted them. No amendment to or modification of these Terms, or action, or delay, will be binding unless in writing and signed by S&S. Provisions of these Terms that would logically survive termination shall survive the termination of these Terms for any reason (including without limitation, Disclaimer of Warranties Waiver, Limitation of Liability; Waiver and Arbitration).
SPECIAL TERMS FOR PIMSLEUR SUBSCRIPTIONS

(“S&S”). By using any of the Pimsleur Subscription Services, you accept these Subscription Terms and agree to be legally bound by them, as well as S&S’S PRIVACY POLICY and TERMS OF USE, of which these Subscription Terms are a part. If there are any discrepancies between these Subscriptions Terms and S&S’S PRIVACY POLICY, or the Subscriptions Terms and any other provisions of the TERMS OF USE with respect to the Pimsleur Subscription Services, the Subscription Terms shall govern. In addition, if you purchase Pimsleur Subscription Services through a third-party platform (typically an in-app purchase) (“3rd Party Platform Purchases”), certain aspects of your subscription will be subject to the terms and conditions of such third party, as set forth in Paragraph 14 below.

We are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from unauthorized use.

To see if Pimsleur Subscription products are accessible with your specific device, visit www.pimsleur.com/c/pimsleur-coursemngrapp.
4. Payment. The purchase of Pimsleur Subscriptions is only available to customers with billing addresses in the United States. The Fees charged to your Payment Method (both terms defined below) may vary from billing period to billing period due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize S&S to charge your Payment Method for these amounts. If you purchase directly from Pimsleur, you can access and edit your credit card or PayPal information (“Payment Method”) used to pay for your Pimsleur Subscription on the Pimsleur.com website. To do so, click on the “Your Account” link, which appears at the top of each page of the site, log in, and then follow the links to the “Details” section of the active Subscription you would like edit. For any 3rd Party Platform Purchase, your billing relationship will be directly with the applicable distributor (defined in Section 14). The applicable third-party distributor will charge you for any fees incurred and you must contact the distributor to make any changes to your payment method.
4.1 Recurring Subscriptions. S&S may offer recurring Pimsleur Subscriptions in one or more term lengths (e.g., monthly, six-month, annual, etc.). These Pimsleur Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each term unless cancelled in accordance with these Subscription Terms (or otherwise terminated in accordance with the Terms). The term lengths available and the Fees for each will be as described on the Sites. By providing Payment Method information for your recurring Pimsleur Subscription, you are agreeing to pay the periodic subscription fee and any applicable taxes and service fees (“Fees”) in connection with your use of your Pimsleur Subscription. The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method automatically at the beginning of your Pimsleur Subscription (or, as described in Section 9, at the end of your Trial Period or the close of your Introductory Rate period, where applicable), and at the beginning of each renewal period thereafter, unless you cancel your Pimsleur Subscription or the Pimsleur Subscription and/or Service is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms. S&S reserves the right to change the pricing of Pimsleur Subscription products at any time. In the event of a price change, S&S will attempt to notify you in advance by sending an email to the address you have registered for your account.  If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your Pimsleur Subscription as described in Section 6. If you do not cancel your Pimsleur Subscription after the price change and prior to the start of your new Subscription period, your subscription will be renewed at the price in effect at the time of the renewal, without any additional action by you, and you authorize Pimsleur to charge your Payment Method for these amounts. If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such discrepancies if you do not notify S&S within 60 days after they are posted to Your Account under the Payment History section specific to a given Pimsleur Subscription.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES. PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.
4.2 Fixed Term One-Time Subscriptions. S&S may, in addition to or in place of recurring Pimsleur Subscriptions, offer other fixed-term, one-time Pimsleur Subscription options that do not automatically renew at the end of the subscription term. By providing Payment Method information for your fixed-term, one-time Pimsleur Subscription, you are agreeing to pay a one-time subscription fee for the subscription period and any applicable taxes and service fees in connection with your use of the Pimsleur Subscription. Fixed-term, one-time Pimsleur Subscriptions cannot be cancelled and are not eligible for a refund. If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such discrepancies if you do not notify S&S within 60 days after they are posted to Your Account under the Payment History section specific to a given Subscription.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES. PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.
5. No Refunds. ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, except as provided for under Pimsleur’s 30-day Money-Back Guarantee pursuant to the terms set forth. As described further in Section 6, and unless subject to specific terms for 3rd Party Platform Purchases as set forth in Paragraph 14, even if you cancel your Pimsleur Subscription during a subscription period, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Fees for the remainder of that subscription period.  In rare circumstances, we may provide a credit, refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our subscribers (“Credits”).  The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole discretion.  The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.
6. Cancellation of Recurring Subscription. You can cancel your recurring Pimsleur Subscription at any time by contacting us at (800) 578-8284 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or by logging in to your account at accounts.pimsleur.com, locating the specific Pimsleur Subscription under “Subscriptions”, clicking on the “Cancel Subscription” link for that Subscription, completing the “Cancel Subscription” form, and clicking “Confirm” on that page. If you cancel your Pimsleur Subscription during a free Trial Period (defined below), access to your Pimsleur Subscription will immediately terminate. If you cancel your Pimsleur Subscription after a Trial Period (should there be one) and during
a paid subscription period, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of the then-current
billing period.  You will have continued access to your Pimsleur Subscription for the remainder of your paid billing period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID.  You must cancel your Pimsleur Subscription no later than 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the last day of your current subscription period to avoid paying the Fees for the next subscription period. (For the purpose of clarity and without limiting the foregoing, if your Pimsleur Subscription is scheduled to renew on January 1st, you must cancel by 11:59 PM ET on December 31st to avoid being charged for a renewal.) After cancellation of your Pimsleur Subscription, you will continue to owe any accrued amounts due under these Subscription Terms and not yet paid.
7. Payment Failure for Recurring Subscriptions. If you fail to pay any renewal Fees as a result of expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, your Pimsleur Subscription may automatically be cancelled and access will be discontinued. (After an initial payment failure, S&S may, in its sole discretion, make additional attempts to charge your payment method for any outstanding Fees before electing to cancel your Pimsleur Subscription.) In the event of cancellation, the status of your Pimsleur Subscription in the Subscription History section of Your Account on Pimsleur.com will indicate “Cancelled”. You will need to repurchase a new Pimsleur Subscription to regain access and no new introductory offers will be available. Your lesson history from the cancelled Pimsleur Subscription will be retained if you subsequently purchase the identical Pimsleur Subscription under the identical user name and password.
8. Promo Codes. From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion. Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion. Unless otherwise stated in the promotion’s terms and conditions, promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, must not be offered for sale or other consideration, are not redeemable for 3rd Party Platform Purchases, and may be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by S&S in its sole discretion. If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.
9. Introductory Offers.S&S may, but is under no obligation, to make available introductory offers for new or certain former subscribers at its sole discretion. Introductory offers may include a free Trial Period or a discounted Introductory Rate (each as described and defined below).
9.1 Trial Period. S&S may provide a limited free trial period (“Trial Period”) to new subscribers and certain former subscribers at its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times. S&S reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period. The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period offer. If S&S provides you with a Trial Period, you must provide valid Payment Method information to S&S in order to access your Pimsleur Subscription product during the Trial Period. S&S will not charge you in connection with the Trial Period. If you do not cancel your Pimsleur Subscription by the last “day” (defined below) of your Trial Period, you authorize S&S to begin your paying Pimsleur Subscription and automatically charge your Payment Method for your first periodic Fee at the end of your Trial Period.  A “day” for the purposes of these Subscription Terms and as relates to trial subscriptions begins at 12:01 AM Eastern Time on the day you complete the sign-up process, regardless of what time of day you actually sign up. S&S WILL NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT YOUR PAYING SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN. IF YOU WISH TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL THE TRIAL PERIOD PRIOR TO 11:59 PM ET ON THE LAST “DAY” OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD. You will only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for your Pimsleur Subscription. If you exceed this limit, S&S may charge your Payment Method for any Trial Period after the first, or suspend your use of the Pimsleur Subscription, in its sole discretion.
9.2. Introductory Rate.S&S may also offer an introductory discount on Fees for a specified period (“Introductory Rate”) to new subscribers and certain former subscribers at its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so, and Introductory Rates may not be available at all times. S&S reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for an Introductory Rate. The specific terms of the Introductory Rate will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular introductory offer. Following the end of the Introductory Rate period, your Pimsleur Subscription will automatically renew at the then-applicable full Fees for the Pimsleur Subscription type that you have selected. S&S WILL NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR INTRODUCTORY RATE HAS ENDED. IF YOU WISH TO AVOID ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR PIMSLEUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO RENEWAL AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 6 ABOVE. Limit one (1) Introductory Rate offer per person and per email address. If you exceed this limit, S&S may charge your Payment Method for the full Fees for the Pimsleur Subscription you have selected, or suspend your use of the Pimsleur Subscription, in its sole discretion.
10. Quality of Service. The perceived quality of the audio content is dependent on the playback quality of the device, the type and level of ambient noise surrounding the user, and the quality of any external speakers/headphones used. Different people may perceive significant differences in audio quality depending on these factors. The speed to download your Pimsleur lessons is dependent on the speed of your Internet connection.
11. Updates and Testing. S&S reserves the right to update and change Pimsleur Subscription content and features at any time. In addition, S&S reserves the right to test various aspects of Pimsleur Subscriptions. S&S reserves the right to, and by using our Pimsleur Subscription Services you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice.
12. Pimsleur Subscription-specific Emails. S&S may send you emails regarding the Site Content or your Pimsleur Subscription from time to time.  You agree that S&S may send you these types of emails to the email address that you provide.  Because these emails are necessary for you to access your Pimsleur Subscription, you agree that you will receive these emails even if you have opted out of receiving other email from S&S. If you do not want to receive these types of emails, you may cancel your Pimsleur Subscription at any time as provided in Section 6.
13. Access to Subscription Services and Accounts. We may take any of the following actions in our sole discretion at any time, and without giving you prior notice:
change or discontinue the Pimsleur Subscription Services;
change how we offer and operate Pimsleur Subscription Services (e.g., to begin charging a fee to access features or Site Content that we previously made available without charge);
remove Site Content from the Pimsleur Subscription Services;
restrict, suspend or terminate your access to one or more Pimsleur Subscription Services or features thereof.
We will not be limited to the remedies above if you violate these Subscription Terms. If S&S terminates your access to the Pimsleur Subscription, you must immediately stop using such Service. However, if you have paid for a Pimsleur Subscription and we discontinue the Service before the end of a paid subscription period, or we terminate your account before the end of a paid subscription period for reasons other than your breach of these Terms, we will refund a prorated portion of the applicable Pimsleur Subscription fee corresponding to the portion of the paid subscription period for which our action caused you not to have access to the relevant Service. If S&S terminates your access to your Pimsleur Subscription because you breached these Subscription Terms (or any other provision of the Terms of Use), you will not be entitled to any refund.
14. Subscriptions Obtained Through Third Parties. If you obtain a Pimsleur Subscription as a 3rd Party Platform Purchase through a third party entity (a “distributor”) that maintains your subscription account and collects your payments for the Pimsleur Subscription Services, that subscription is subject to the distributor’s terms, and the provisions of these Subscription Terms concerning subscription purchase, billing, cancellation/refunds, and payment do not apply to that subscription to the extent these Subscription Terms conflict with the distributor’s terms. When you access a Pimsleur Subscription through a portal provided by such a third-party distributor, and the distributor transmits subscription content to you, the provisions of these Subscription Terms concerning access to and delivery of such content do not necessarily apply, and in the event of a conflict, the distributor’s applicable terms govern. For 3rd Party Platform Purchases, your billing relationship will be directly with the applicable distributor, and not with S&S. Any fees charged for your Pimsleur Subscription will be billed by the applicable distributor using the payment information you have provided to such distributor. To cancel a Pimsleur Subscription obtained as a 3rd Party Platform Purchase, please follow the cancellation instructions and adhere to the deadlines set out by the applicable distributor.
If you do not agree to these Subscription Terms, you should immediately stop using the Pimsleur Subscription Services.
OUR RIGHT TO UPDATE THESE TERMS
S&S reserves the right to modify or add to these Terms at any time without prior notice ("Updated Terms"). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Sites so that they are accessible via a link on the homepage or otherwise, and that your use of a Site after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.
