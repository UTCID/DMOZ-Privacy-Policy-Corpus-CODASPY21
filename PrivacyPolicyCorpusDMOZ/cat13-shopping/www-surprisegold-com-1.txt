Firstly, I'd like to assure visitors to this site, that we are not affected by the heartbleed virus, as it only goes for https pages. As we don't take credit card payments here, we have no need for https pages.The Privacy Policy of this website is very simple. The only data collected, are the names and email addresses of customers or potential customers, when they make contact for advice on custom designs and if they order, the postal addresses to send the jewellery items to. When a customer sends payment for an order, it is by bank transfer (preferred), cheque or credit card, but in the case of credit cards, the transaction is handled by PayPal, so no credit card details are collected here. Under no circumstances will customer's or potential customer's names or contact delails be released to any third party.                                 unique engagement rings   wedding rings
