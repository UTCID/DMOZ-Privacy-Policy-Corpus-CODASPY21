Purchasing Any type of Gun From Gorilla Surplus (www.gorillasurplus.com) A Firearm is defined as below in Canada.
These are air guns with both a high muzzle velocity (greater than 152.4 metres or 500 feet per second) and a high muzzle energy (greater than 5.7 joules or 4.2 foot-pounds). The “muzzle velocity” is the speed of a projectile at the instant it leaves the muzzle of a gun, normally expressed in metres per second or feet per second. The “muzzle energy” is the energy of a projectile at the instant it leaves the muzzle of a gun, expressed in joules or foot-pounds. Air guns need to meet both standards to be classified as firearms for purposes of the Firearms Act.
These high-powered air guns are subject to the same license and registration requirements as a conventional firearm. Owners and users are also required to store, transport, display and handle them safely in accordance with the regulations supporting the Firearms Act.
Please note all guns, pellet guns, BB guns, airsoft guns, or any other type of gun purchased fall below the FPS regulations and therefore IS NOT A FIREARM as per the Firearms Act.
YOU MUST BE 18 YEARS OLD IF YOU ARE BUYING A KNIFE, BATON, OR AIRGUN.
