Static vs. Sticky Decorative Films are available in both static cling and adhesive varieties.
Adhesive films offer durability and long-lasting beauty, while static cling varieties are reusable and repositionable. Both styles require the same simple installation. Static cling films can be used on a variety of surfaces, including plastic and plexiglass. To adjust the style or sunlight in a room, static cling films can be easily changed out for seasons, holidays and special occasions
Easy installation

Decorative Films are easily installed in less than 30 minutes, using a few simple tools. Watch the video below for step-by-step installation instructions.
