"We love your website and use it frequently during our assessments and intervention for children with severe disabilities."
Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital
"Access + Engagement = SUCCESS!
HelpKidzLearn has consistently provided high-quality creative supports for students who struggle with access."
Dr Caroline Musselwhite Ed.D. CCC/SLP: American Author and Inclusion Expert
"I love a product (ChooseIt! Maker 3) that does a job well. To be able to create an app, that is differentiated, personalised and accessible and can be shared to any number of iPads, that can then work offline is genius!"
Carol Allen, School Improvement Advisor (ICT and SEN)
"My school district has used HelpKidzLearn for several years. We have seen students show their great learning potential through the use of your adaptive games and activities."
Diane Roth, Speech Pathologist
"HelpKidzLearn has helped my students engage in meaningful activities. With an adaptive switch, they are able to participate in activities that they would otherwise not be able to participate. I use this website for skills such as counting, reading, listening, attending, and cause and effect. It is extremely useful in my classroom."
Tara Hill, Special Needs Teacher for students with Profound Mental Disabilities
"HelpKidzLearn has become my go-to tool for teaching students basic cause/effect. My students respond well to HelpKidzLearn activities. When paired with a wireless switch even my students who have gross motor and fine motor disabilities can be involved and have shown great progress with cause/effect."
Hope Jones, Preschool Special Needs Teacher for Developmentally Delayed Students
