With years of experience, our team provides some of the most hard-wearing, functional, and beautiful office workspace solutions available on the market to businesses just like yours.

Office furniture designs should inspire employees and encourage them to assist each other with crucial tasks in the workplace. That is why our workstations and desks some in endless different variations to suit any individual requirement. If workers need to pick each other’s brains or collaborate on a job, they can do so with ease using some of our next-level solutions without having to move around the building or rely on an interoffice communication system.
It’s also vital that employers focus on the health and wellbeing of their team members who spend a lot of time sitting down at their office desks. That is why we stock a full range of height adjustable standing desks that improve circulation and limit the number of days individuals might take off sick due to lumbar discomfort. Workers who don’t have to leave their stations for ten minutes every hour to stretch their legs will become more productive each day, and so the products have the potential to increase profits while keeping everyone happy and content.
We believe that asking employees to sit in cubicles all day long is not the right strategy for business owners who want to improve their companies. Our furniture designs inspire your employees and help bring the firm's ideas to life by encouraging spontaneous meetings and discussions. That is why so many entrepreneurs and professionals have already invested since we started trading way back in 2011. There is no getting away from the fact that people work better when they feel better, and that’s the result our designs aim to create.
The quality of seating is also a major problem for many professionals who want to ensure their team members don’t place too much strain on their lower back. Thankfully, we stock a plethora of chairs, stools, and acoustic seating solutions for any situation or environment. The last products assist in workplaces that can become too noisy to make telephone calls or too busy to avoid distractions. Sometimes having a quiet area where workers can sit and perform small tasks will make everyone’s life that little bit easier.
Of course, there a plenty of other parts of the office in which our products could create improvements for business owners. Our reception desks and boardroom tables are second to none, and they come in a range of different colours and sizes to ensure the items blend well with all office themes. Indeed, the largest boardroom table in our range can accommodate no less than forty people, but there are lots of smaller designs too.
Storage can often become somewhat of a hassle in smaller spaces, and so we’ve become the one stop shop for filing cabinets, lockers, and other solutions of that nature. Anyone who takes a look at the appropriate pages on this site will discover hundreds of items that could help their operations to become organised and ensure the office never becomes untidy. We also supply a huge range of presentation materials like whiteboards that could provide some much-needed visuals for work projects and meetings.
With an emphasis on durability and stunning aesthetics, every member of the Urban Hyve team strives to satisfy the requirements of our clients while remaining as competitive as possible in the marketplace. We even offer a free workplace design consultation that’s become a popular choice for new customers who want to get the best results from their purchases. Anyone who wants more information about that just needs to visit the appropriate website page.
As if that wasn’t enough, we now provide free shipping on all online orders, and buyers have the option to use Afterpay if they wish to pay for their goods at a later date without accumulating interest. Our team promises to do everything possible to ensure customers feel 100% satisfied with their purchases, and assistance is only a short phone call away if anyone needs advice or guidance. Those who want to visit us in person should head on down to our Sydney, Melbourne, or Western Sydney showrooms and start a conversation. There is always a friendly face around to offer support.
