Much of the information that we collect automatically is collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies, as well as through your web browser or device. The House relies on partners to provide many features and to process and collect data about your use of our Services and other sites.
Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing the website. These pieces of information allow the websites to remember important information that will make your use of those sites more useful. Our sites and other websites use cookies for a variety of purposes. We use third party cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and process information about your browsing and buying activity on our website.
We contract with one or more third party site analysis service partners to provide us with a data collection and reporting service. When you access our site, a third party site analysis service partner may use cookies and other technologies on our behalf and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on our website. Such data collection may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partner. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browsers Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you wont have access to many of our features that make your web experience more efficient.
Beacons
Our HTML-formatted emails may contain a web beacon to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email. We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users. The web beacon will be deleted when you delete the email. Emails in plain text (if applicable) rather than HTML will not include the web beacon.
Pixel tags
We use pixel tags (also sometimes also known as web beacons), which are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript, to understand how consumers interact with our site online, including on websites and in mobile apps. Pixel tags are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to read and place cookies and transmit information to us or our partners.
Mobile Identifiers
When accessing our website on a mobile device or using any of our mobile applications, we will have access to your location if you have enabled location services on your device. We will also have access to your mobile device ID, which is unique to your device and does not by itself contain any personally identifiable information.
How We Use the Personal Information that We Collect
When you supply us with personal information, the information you provide is added to our customer file. We may use the information we collect for the following purposes:
To contact you regarding promotions, discounts, and other Services, provided by The House or our third party business partners, and when you request email bulletins or newsletters.To contact you in response to an inquiry, complaint, or incident report.To provide you with our products and services, including to complete transactions, take steps to enter into a contract for sale or for services, process payments, fulfill orders, and send service communications.To enable additional features on our Services and to provide you with a personalized service.Create custom audiences on social media sites and search engine platforms and to understand and respond to your comments and reviews of our Services on social media sites and search engine platforms.To provide you with the best service, improve and grow our business, and understand the effectiveness of our marketing, including by understanding our customer base and purchasing trends.To understand how our Services are being used, track site performance, and make improvements.To deliver tailored advertising on our Services based on your preferences or interests across services and devices and measuring the effectiveness of ads.To detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be fraudulent or illegal, and to comply with legal requirements regarding the provision of products and services.
How We Share Your Information
Service Providers
We engage the following types of vendors to perform functions on our behalf such as: delivery services, customer information management, customer communications and marketing services, billing and collection, order fulfillment, auditing and accounting, professional services/consultants; analytics services; security services; and IT support. These companies are restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to deliver or provide you our products and services. There are limited circumstances in which the service provider collects data directly from you when their privacy policies may also apply.
Content Providers
On some of our sites, we provide content that is created by a third-party website. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information collected is shared between our third-party sponsors and us.
Social Media Platforms
Where you choose to interact with us through social media, your interaction with these programs typically allows the social media company to collect some information about you through cookies or other tracking mechanisms that they place on your device. In some cases, the social media company may recognize you through its digital cookies even when you do not interact with their application. Please visit the social media companies respective privacy policies to better understand their data collection practices and the controls they make available to you.
Third-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers
We partner with companies that assist us in advertising about our Services to others who may be interested in the Services. These companies may use tracking technologies to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide analytical services, interest tagging, and ad targeting.
In addition, some advertisements on our site are promoting products and services from third-party companies. These companies are called network advertisers. Network advertisers collect information when you visit our site. The information is collected using technology, so you may not realize it is being collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they can show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you.
Our privacy policy does not apply when you click on an advertisement and leave our site. You must read the privacy policy of that advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on its site.
Business Partners and Sponsors
To enhance your experience on our Services, we provide information to a select group of companies that offer products and services that may be of interest to you (our business partners).
On occasion, we offer promotions  such as sweepstakes  in conjunction with a sponsor. We may share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product or otherwise fulfill the promotional offer. We may share your information with those sponsors that can send you other special promotions. In addition, we will occasionally send e-mail promotions to our users on behalf of third-party sponsors regarding lifestyle-related products or services.
Sale of Businesses
We may sell certain of our businesses or assets to other companies in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy. When such transactions take place, visitor information (including personal information) may constitute a part of the transferred business assets. In the event that we, or any of our affiliates, sell some, all or substantially all of our assets to another company, visitor information (including personal infromation) likely will be disclosed and transferred as an asset to such company.
Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of our Users and our Sites
We will disclose personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, sweepstakes/contest rules, or assert or defend other legal claims; to a regulator or consumer protection authority with jurisdiction over us, or to protect the safety, integrity, and security of our Services, users, and information.
We are not responsible for what third parties do with any information that you make available in public areas of our Services. As such, we advise that you exercise great care in determining what information you choose to make publicly available through our services.
Additional Information About Our Data Practices
Sharing of Aggregated Data
We may share aggregated or deidentified data at our discretion, including with marketing agencies, media agencies and analytics providers. These other companies will not be able to relate this data to identifiable individuals.
Combination of Information
We may combine information from the Services together and with other information we obtain from our business records. Additionally, information collected about you from a particular browser or device may be linked to information collected from another computer or device that we believe relates to you.
Sharing of Medical or Health Information
To the extent that we receive health information about you, that information is subject to electronic disclosure to extent permitted by applicable law.
Choices You Have About Our Collection, Usage and Sharing of Your Information
How You Can Access Your Communication Preferences
Communication preferences are permissions that you have granted us to communicate with you on specific areas of interest. You may review and made modifications to your communication preferences by clicking Contact Us located at the bottom of all of our web pages or send an email directly to privacy@the-house.com. Please include information in the email that will help us identify you so we can assist you with your inquiry or request.
E-mail Communications
When you register with us or give us your contact information, you may have an opportunity to limit e-mail communications from us and our third-party marketing partners. At any time you can request that we not send e-mails to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us at privacy@the-house.com.
Direct Mail Communications
When you subscribe to our email newsletters or otherwise do business with us, please tell us if you do not want to receive our direct mail marketing offers for any or just certain products and/or services. We will mark your account for a three-year period. You will not receive any direct mail offers from us during this three-year period for those products and/or services that you have indicated to us that you are not interested in receiving. If you change your mind, just get in touch with us and ask that we include you in future offerings. Please note that because marketing campaigns are planned a few months ahead of time, you may continue to receive marketing offers for two to four months after making a request. Write to us at The House Mail Preference Service, P200 S. Owasso Blvd. St. Paul, MN 55117 to opt out from specific future mailings.
Third Party Ad Tracking and Serving
Our third party advertising and business partners may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by following instructions on the NAIs website: https://www.networkadvertising.org/.
The Type of Security We Provide
We use a combination of physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the information we collect through the Services. While we use these precautions to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee the security of the networks, systems, servers, devices, and databases we operate or that are operated on our behalf.
There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the web so that other people using the same computer wont have access to your information.
Children
Our site is not directed to or intended for, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. If you are under sixteen, please do not submit any personal information through our website. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their childrens internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information on our website without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal informationto us through this website, please contact us.
International Users
Our site is operated and hosted in the United States. Information that you provide to us and the data that we collect as a result of your visiting and using our site will be collected, processed in and transferred to the U.S. and is subject to U.S. law. The privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. may not be equivalent to or adequate under the laws in your country of residence or from which you access this site. By visiting this site or by providing us with your personal information you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S.
California and Nevada Privacy Rights
Persons with disabilities may obtain this notice in alternative format upon request by contacting us at privacy@the-house.com.
California Shine the Light
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to privacy@the-house.com. Our website currently does not honor browser do not track signals.
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of Personal Information, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information. The CCPA defines Personal Information as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a specific federal privacy law, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below.
