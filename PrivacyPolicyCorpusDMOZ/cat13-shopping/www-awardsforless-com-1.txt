We respect your privacy!
We at Awards For Less respect your privacy and assure you that the information we collect is only used to process your order and remains confidential. We will not, under any circumstances provide your information to outside people or companies.
We understand that our business is based on the relationships with our customer and will strive to maintain that trust. Again, your information is secure with us.
Your transactions are secure!
This site uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology in order to ensure optimum confidentiality of your information. SSL technology secretly encodes information that is sent over the Internet between your computer and our store, helping to ensure that the information remains confidential. The SSL protocol maintains the security and integrity of the transmission channel by using encryption, authentication, and message authentication codes.
At Awards For Less, we do not store any of your credit card information. We pass it on to the payment gateways and banks to process the financial transactions, but by no means do we store that information. This ensures that your sensitive information is safe.
