Privacy Policy:
General
Your use of this website is governed by our Terms of Use.
Accordingly, this Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with our Terms of
Use.
Information Collection and Use
KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. is the sole owner of any information
collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to
others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. KINGDOM OF
PETS Ltd. collects information from our users at several different points on
our website. We stress that all personal information is always treated as
personal and confidential, unless specifically stated otherwise.
An example of this is that when you sign up to a KINGDOM OF PETS
newsletter series (6 Day Courses or free trials) your email address is only
recorded so that we can send you KINGDOM
OF PETS newsletters
and/or free trial.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if
you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct,
update or remove the personal data you provided to us. This can be done by
clicking the “change subscription options” link at the bottom of any email from
us or by sending us an email.
Success Stories and Reviews
We only use names, photos and testimonials or reviews of
people who have given us permission to do so. If you have feedback about any KINGDOM OF PETS product then please email us.
Please state whether or not we are allowed to use your feedback as a
testimonial.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Links
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware
that KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such
other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to
read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information
collected by this Website.
Security
This website takes certain precautions to protect our users’
information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
information is protected both online and off-line. However, there is
unfortunately no way yet for the industry to guarantee that the information you
transmit through the Internet is entirely secure.
Notice to Parents
This website is not specifically directed at or intended for
children. Our public forums, such as the chat rooms and message boards, are
considered non-confidential communications. Much of the content in these public
areas, including the content within specific messages, comments or postings is
provided by and is the responsibility of the third party creator of the
communication or the person posting the information. KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. does not
control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any public forum
and, therefore, KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. specifically disclaims any liability with regard to
public forums and any actions resulting from a user’s participation in any
public forum. KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. has no responsibility for such content and is merely
providing access to such content as a service to its users.
The best way for you as a parent to protect your child’s
online privacy and safety is through supervision and parental guidance. Visit
the sites that your child uses. Good communication with the child will help him/her
be more aware of the risks involved in providing strangers with personal
information, especially when using chat-rooms or e-mail. We strongly recommend
that you supervise your children’s activities when using these services as you
would in any public area.
For your information, as a parent or legal guardian of a
child under 13 years old, you have the right to review your child’s personal
information gathered by Internet sites. You may ask to have your child’s
information deleted from their records and refuse to allow any further
collection or use of your child’s information. KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. does not
collect information from registrants who indicate to be under 13 years old.
Notification of Changes
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
via the Privacy Policy links on the website so our users are aware of what
information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we
disclose it.
Thank you for visiting this KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. website.
