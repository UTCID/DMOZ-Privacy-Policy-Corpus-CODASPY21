Terms and Conditions
Terms & Conditions Published on Website – November 2015
These are the Terms & Conditions for www.msmugs.com and all other websites operated by Mclaggan Smith Mugs Ltd ("our websites").
Our websites are operated by Mclaggan Smith Mugs Limited (?we?, ?us? or ?our?). This page together with the documents expressly referred to within it state the legal terms and conditions (?Terms?) under which you may use our websites and under which we sell any of the products listed on our websites (?Products?) to you. By using our websites you agree to be bound by the Terms that apply to your use of our websites. If you do not agree to these Terms please refrain from using our websites.
These Terms will apply to any contract for the sale of Products by us to you (?Contract?). Please read through these Terms carefully before placing your order and retain a copy for future reference. Please note that before placing an order you will be asked to agree to these Terms.
Before you place an order, if you have any questions relating to these Terms please contact us by e-mailing sales@msmugs.com, or call us on +44 (0)1389 755 655 between 9.00am and 5.00pm UK time (Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays in Scotland). Our customer services operators speak only English. Please note that all calls made from UK landlines will be charged at your standard landline rate. Mobile phone and international call charges will vary.
We may revise these Terms at any time by updating this page. You should visit this page periodically to review the Terms because they are binding on you. Continued use of our websites constitutes your agreement to all such revised terms. Every time you order Products from us, the Terms in force at that time will apply to the Contract between you and us.
INFORMATION ABOUT USMclaggan Smith Mugs Limited is a limited company registered in Scotland under company number 108315 and has its registered office and main trading address at Jamestown, Alexandria, Scotland. Our VAT number is GB264794127.
HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US You will be guided through the process of placing an order by a series of simple instructions on our websites. Please take the time to read and check your order at each stage of the order process.
You will have the opportunity to review your order and to correct any errors before placing your order. You will find further instructions on our websites.
You complete and place your order by clicking on the button marked Pay Now. After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order and setting out the details of your order. However, please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order is an offer to purchase the Products and no contract exists between you and us for the sale of any Products at this point.
We will confirm our acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Products have been dispatched (?Dispatch Confirmation?). The Contract between us will only be formed when we send to you the Dispatch Confirmation.
The Contract will be exclusively in the English language. We will not file a copy of the Contract.
In using our websites and by placing an order you warrant that you are legally capable of entering into a binding contract with us. You may only purchase Products from our websites if you are at least 18 years old.
If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in stock or no longer available, or because of an error in the price on our websites, or because of our inability to obtain authorisation for your payment, we will inform you of this by e-mail without undue delay and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Products, we will refund you the full amount without undue delay.
DESCRIPTION AND PRICE OF PRODUCTS We take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of Products appearing on our websites are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto our system. Although we aim to keep our websites as up to date as possible, the information, including the descriptions of Products, appearing on our websites at a particular time may not always reflect the position at the time you place your order.
The images of the Products on our site are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer, tablet or mobile phone (your ?Device?) will display those colours accurately to reflect the colour of the Products. Your Products may vary slightly from those images. Our websites contain a large number of Products. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products on our websites may be incorrectly priced. We cannot confirm the price of a Product until your order is accepted by us. If we discover an error in the price of the Products you have ordered we will inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price. Prices for our Products may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order that we have confirmed with a Dispatch Confirmation.
The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.
The price of a Product does not include delivery charges, which are payable by you in addition. Our delivery char
PAYMENT
We use the services of a payment provider for all on-line purchases and when you place an order on our websites you will be re-directed to Barclaycard or PayPal's websites (depending on your chosen method of payment) in order to process your payment and enter your card details.  At no time do we have access to your card details.  All correspondence in respect of payment issues should be directed to the respective payment provider.  Visit www.barclaycard.co.uk or www.paypal.com for further details.  Barclaycard and PayPal are audited annually under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and are  fully approved Level 1 payment services providers.
Offers and promotional discount codes offered by us are valid only for use as part of a purchase made via our websites or by telephone order, unless otherwise stated. Such promotional discounts are not valid for use as part of a purchase in any other shops.
Offers and promotional discounts are only available subject to their specific terms and conditions which will be shown on our websites.
YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL
If you are a consumer (that is, you enter into the Contract for a purpose outside your trade, business or profession), you have a legal right to cancel the Contract, without giving any reason, during the period set out below. This means that during the relevant period if you change your mind or for any other reason you decide you do not want to keep a Product, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the Contract and receive a refund.
However, this cancellation right does not apply in the case of Products which have been personalised to your specification.
Your legal right to cancel a Contract starts from the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, which is when the Contract between us is formed. If the Products have already been delivered to you, you have a period of 28 days in which you may cancel, starting from the day after the day you receive the Products.
To cancel a Contract, you must inform us by giving a clear statement of your decision to cancel. You can inform us in writing by sending an e-mail to sales@msmugs.com or by sending a letter to us at: Customer Services, Mclaggan Smith Mugs Ltd, Jamestown, Alexandria G83 8BS.
You may wish to keep a copy of your cancellation notification for your own records.
You can also inform us by calling the customer services team on +44 (0) 1389 755 655. Our customer services operators speak only English.
If you send us your cancellation notice by e-mail or by letter, then your cancellation is effective from the date you sent the e-mail or the letter to us. If you call us to notify us of your cancellation, then your cancellation is effective from the date you telephone us.
EFFECTS OF CANCELLATION
If you cancel the Contract, we will refund to you all payments you have made to us under the Contract. We will also refund you for the costs of delivery if the cancellation is due to receipt of defective products, unless you have chosen a delivery option other than our least-expensive delivery option, in which case we will refund you up to the amount that our least-expensive delivery option would have cost you.  Delivery charges will not be refunded if cancellation is due to any other reason.
We will refund you without undue delay, after receipt of cancellation and, if requested, once the Products have been returned to us. We will refund you using the payment method you used to pay for the Products, unless you expressly agree otherwise. You will not have to pay any fees as result of the refund.

Quality & Environment:
Whilst making and printing mugs isn’t exactly an environmentally friendly process we take heart that our mugs are reusable and sturdy enough that many remain in use after years of wear.  We have regular energy audits and strive to implement more recommendations to further reduce our carbon footprint.
Care & Use of Mclaggan Smith Mugs:
Due to Health Regulations, lead has been removed from ceramic glazes leaving our mugs more vulnerable to staining.  Mugs should be rinsed shortly after use and any stains may be removed with a weak solution of bleach.  Some colours are susceptible to fading with repeated dishwasher use, depending on the hardness of the water in your area; we therefore recommend hand washing with occasional dishwasher use to maintain colour quality.
