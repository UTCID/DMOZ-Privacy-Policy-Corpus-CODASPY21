4 Helpful Patient Care Items
Staff Writer
October 7th 2019
There are many
different care items on the market for elderly patients. As a caregiver, it can
be difficult to know which ones are necessary and most helpful. If the adult
you are caring for has incontinence issues, you want to invest in high-quality adult diapers.
Read on for
information about 4 helpful patient care items.Adult Diapers
Adult diapers
are a critical patient care item if you are caring for someone with
incontinence issues. The key to finding the
perfect
diaper
is to try out
various brands and absorbency levels. In some cases, adults need a variety of
diapers for different times of day and activities. For example, they might need a high-absorbency tab style brief during the night but a lower-absorbency pull up in the daytime. Have your
patient test out diapers in different brands, styles and absorbency's until they find the one that is
the perfect fit.Abdominal Binders
Abdominal
binders are necessary for adults who have strains or weaknesses in their back,
abdominal area, or rib cage. The binders conform to the body, providing support
and comfort. These binders come in various sizes with different numbers of
panels so that you can find the one that fits comfortably for your patient. Binders
are also used to help patients recover after abdominal surgery.Compression Stockings
Compression
stockings are important for patients who spend a lot of time sitting or in bed.
Elderly adults who have trouble walking are at risk for blood clots.
Compression stockings improve blood circulation to help prevent blood clots.
These should be worn when the patient is sitting or lying down for a prolonged
amount of time.Positioning Aids
Positioning
aids are items placed in beds to help patients feel more comfortable. These
positioning aids are made of foam with removable/washable covers. They are
perfect for elevating the head, feet, or legs for optimal patient comfort.
Invest in a few of these to keep your patient as comfortable as possible.
Being a
caregiver comes with many responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is
making sure your patient or loved one is comfortable. There are many different patient-care
items that can help make things easier for your patient or loved one. Testing them out and
finding what works best for each person is important. Adult diapers, abdominal
binders, compression stockings, and positioning aids are all items that your
patient or loved one might need. Fortunately, all these items can be ordered online through
LL Medico.
