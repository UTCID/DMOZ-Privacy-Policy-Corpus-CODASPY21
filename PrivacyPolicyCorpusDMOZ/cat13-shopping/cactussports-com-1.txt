Cactus Sports is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. Information collected during the ordering process is used for processing your order. All information you provide to us electronically is kept confidential and will not be applied in ways to which you have not consented. If consenting to allow Cactus Sports to contact you, contact will be made on a limited basis and will allow you to opt-out at any time. We will not sell or disclose any information that identifies you to a third party.
We also collect information about your use of our website through the application of "cookies." This information helps us customize our website and allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website and for what purpose. We have implemented remarketing tools with Google. We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We, along with third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on customer’s past visits to our website. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings found on Google.com. We will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on DoubleClick cookie unless we have robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative (i.e. opt-in) consent to, that merger.
