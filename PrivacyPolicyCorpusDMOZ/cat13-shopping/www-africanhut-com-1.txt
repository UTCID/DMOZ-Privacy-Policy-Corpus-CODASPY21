If you placed your order on/before 12/3 your order will leave our warehouse no later than 12/14 and will arrive in time for Christmas.

Frozen and regular items can not be purchased in the same order. Frozen products require special handling, and except for destinations with zip codes 84000-93999 that can ship with the UPS Ground option, Next Day Air or Second Day Air shipping is required. These shipping options are a lot more expensive per pound than Ground shipping. Please place a separate order for your frozen/perishable items and choose Next Day Air, or Second Day Air at checkout.
