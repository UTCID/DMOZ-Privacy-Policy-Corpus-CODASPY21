I Have Created an Account with WHSmith.co.uk Previously, Why Do I Need to Create a New One?
When we upgraded WHSmith.co.uk in May 2019, existing customer accounts were not moved across to the new website. This means that if you created an account with us before May 2019, your data has been permanently deleted and you no longer have an account with us.
You can create a new account on our current website here. Creating a new account is quick and easy, but alternatively you can still shop with us as a guest if you prefer.

What are the Benefits of Creating a New Account?
By creating a new account, you can track your orders online, review your order history, save your details for quicker checkout and request to cancel your order online. If you choose to checkout as a guest instead, you will need to re-enter all your details each time you shop with us, and call our customer services team to make any enquiries about your order.

Do You Still Have my Orders, Details and Data Saved from my Previous Account?
No - your order history, card details, address, personal details and data has been permanently deleted with your previous account. If you opted to receive marketing emails from us, however, then we will have saved your email address in a separate database, and we will retain this data unless you request for it to be deleted.

What if I Have an Outstanding Order on my Old Account?
Your order should have been processed as normal. If you have an unfulfilled order on your old account that is late or causing you concern, please contact our customer services team on 0333 6005000 Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm to check its status.

Will I Still be able to Request a Refund, Return or Exchange on Items Ordered on my Previous Account?
You will still have the right to request a refund, return or exchange but will be unable to do so using the website. Instead, you will need to contact our customer services team on 0333 6005000 to check if you are eligible and to place the request.

Will I Still Receive Emails from You if I Don't Create a New Account?
Yes - if you opted to receive marketing emails from us when you created your previous account, then you will continue to do so even if you do not create a new account. This is because your email address will have been saved in our marketing database, which is separate to your account.
If you no longer wish to receive these emails, you can click 'unsubscribe' at the bottom of any of our emails.
