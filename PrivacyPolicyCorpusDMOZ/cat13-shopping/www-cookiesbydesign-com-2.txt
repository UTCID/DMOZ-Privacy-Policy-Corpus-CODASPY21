SUBMISSIONS
CBD is pleased to hear from its customers and welcomes your comments regarding CBD products and services, including this Site. Unfortunately, however, CBD's long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas (including operating ideas, designs, and original artwork, etc.), suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested (see below). While we value your feedback, we request that you be specific in your comments regarding our services and products, and that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials. It is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by CBD's professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.
If, at our request, you send or post (i.e., via contests) certain specific submissions, or, despite our request that you not send us any creative ideas, suggestions or other materials, you do so anyway (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the exclusive property of CBD. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of CBD, and CBD shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, CBD shall exclusively own the copyright and all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe, and CBD shall be entitled to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, license, create derivative works from and distribute such materials or incorporate such Submissions into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to those who provide the Submissions. In addition, you warrant that your Submissions do not violate any person's so-called "moral rights" or other similar or analogous rights under any applicable laws in any country or region of the world. Applicable law may restrict or limit the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. If so, without limitation of the foregoing, you agree that, in no event, shall CBD's total liability exceed $5,000.
You agree to indemnify CBD for any and all claims, damages, losses, and causes of action arising as a result of your Submissions or your failure to comply with the Terms of Service.
Please refer to the GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE SERVICES below for additional information concerning Submissions.

CBD SERVICES AND RULES FOR USE
As a convenience to its visitors, CBD may provide, from time to time and at its sole discretion, one or more Services, such as e-mail functions, polls, surveys, and other services. These Services are provided by CBD to you and others subject to the Terms of Service, the Guidelines set forth below, the Privacy Policy, and other rules that may be published from time to time (collectively, the "Rules") by CBD. CBD currently provides the Services free of charge to users who agree to be bound and abide by the Rules. CBD reserves the right to change the nature of this relationship at any time.
REGISTRATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
In consideration for your use of the Services, you agree to (i) comply with the Rules, (ii) provide accurate, complete and true information about yourself as may be required on any registration form for Services ("Registration Information") in order to create your User Account, and (iii) maintain and update, as applicable, your Registration Information with current and complete information.

As part of your User Account, you will be responsible for creating, and maintaining the confidentiality of your password. We urge you to memorize your password or keep it in a secure place, away from the rest of your User Account information, as sharing your password with others may lead to unauthorized access to your User Account and the information therein. You agree that you will (i) immediately notify CBD of any unauthorized use of your User Account, and (ii) ensure that you properly exit all Services at the completion of your use session. CBD shall have no liability for any loss or damage arising from your use of a User Account, the Site or any Service, or your failure to comply with these requirements.
GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE SERVICES
You are entirely responsible and liable for all activities conducted by you, and/or any other user of your User Account and of the Services.

Intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, including, but not limited to, any regulations having the force of law while using or accessing any Services;
Invade the privacy or violate any personal or proprietary right of any person or entity; or

LINKED SITES
This Site may frame, and/or contain links to or advertisements about, non-CBD web sites. Other web sites may also reference, advertise, or link to the Site. CBD does not endorse or sponsor other web sites and is not responsible for the content of such web sites. CBD expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on non-CBD web sites, and denies all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other web sites and advertisements.
NON-UNITED STATES RESIDENTS
CBD makes no representation that the Site Content, including products or merchandise offered for sale on the Site, and their copyrights, trademarks, patents, and licensing arrangements, are appropriate or available for use in locations other than the United States.

CBD may also, in its sole discretion and at any time, discontinue this Site or Services or limit or restrict any user's access thereto, for any reason. You understand and agree that CBD may take any one or more of these actions without any notice to you, prior or otherwise. Should CBD take any of these actions, it may, in its sole discretion, immediately deactivate and/or delete any or all information about and concerning your User Account, including your Registration Information. You understand and agree that CBD shall not have any liability to you or any other person for any termination of your access to any Services and/or the removal of information concerning your User Account.
