14. NOTNEUTRAL PRIVACY POLICY.
notNeutral is committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you as
to what information may be collected from you when visiting our web site, how such information will be used by
us, with whom such information may be shared, your choices regarding the collection and use of such information,
your ability to update, correct or delete such information and the security procedures that we have implemented
to protect your privacy.
Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, and may change them at any time. If we
decide to change any of the provisions of this privacy policy, we will inform you by posting a notice on our web
site. This privacy policy, and any dispute arising under it, is governed by our terms of use policy, as
described in our Legal Notice.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any web sites to which you may link
from our web site, including such web sites' use of any information (such as IP address, browser type or
operating system) collected when visitors to our web site click to such other sites. We strongly encourage you
to read and become familiar with the privacy practices of third party web sites.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
notNeutral collects three types of information about users of our web site:
(1) NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION: When you visit our web site, we automatically collect and
aggregate certain non-personally-identifiable information indicating, among other things, which pages of our web
site you visited, the order in which they were visited, the products and services you viewed or searched for,
and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the logging of your Internet Protocol
(IP) address, the operating system used by the computer from which you connect to our web site and the type of
browser software you are using. Although such information does not identify you personally, we can determine
your Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of your point of connectivity from your IP address.
(2) Cookies: We also use "cookies" -- small text files placed on a user's computer hard drive by our
servers when a user visits our web site -- to help us determine how users, in the aggregate, use our web site,
and to maintain the "clickstream" information we need for you to shop at notNeutral.com. Essentially, cookies
are your identification card for our servers and allow us to track your orders on our web site, serve you more
efficiently and personalize your experience at notNeutral.com. Cookies are read only by the server that placed
them and are unable to execute any code. We do not use cookies to store personally-identifiable information.
Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether your web browser will accept cookies. For more
information on how to do so, please consult the documentation accompanying your browser software. Please note
that if you disable cookies, our ordering and checkout process may not work for you.
(3) PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:
We collect certain personally-identifiable information depending on how you use our web site. Personal
information is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could
reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. When you order products
from us, we collect your full name; shipping and, if different, billing address; email address; phone number;
credit card number (with expiration date); and, if you provide them, your facsimile number and company name
("Order Information"). We also collect any comparable information you supply about the person to whom you send a
gift. We will retain a record of all your on-line purchases.
If you choose to become a registered user, we collect a login name, your full name, mailing address, email
address, phone number, and a password ("Registration Information"). You do not have to be a registered user to
place an order for our products, but registered users can complete their product orders more quickly than
non-registered users.
We collect and compile a database of the name, personal email address, and/or mailing
address of those users who choose to provide us with such information when registering for our Opt-In email list
("Contact Information").
HOW WE USE (OR DO NOT USE) THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with how we use and do not use the information we collect from
you. To serve you better, we may combine information you provide us from various sources, whether online or in
person:
(1) NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:
notNeutral uses non-personally-identifiable information in aggregate form to build a higher quality and
more enjoyable online experience at notNeutral.com. We statistically analyze the collective characteristics and
behavior of our users and visitors, and measure demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our web
site. (2) PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:
notNeutral uses order information and registration information solely for internal business purposes, such
as processing product orders, and to enhance your shopping experience with us. We use contact information solely
to provide occasional e-mail notices regarding our web site, our physical store and/or product updates that may
be of interest to individuals on our contact information database. We will also use the contact information to
provide catalogs and other mailers if a user provides a mailing address. we will not send you any e-mail notices
or otherwise contact you regarding our company, products and services unless you affirmatively request such
information from us. If you do not want us to use any order information, registration information and/or contact
information we collect from you in the manner described above, please do not provide it to us. Please note that
if you do not provide us with certain personally-identifiable information, you may not be able to order products
from us.
notNeutral will not sell any Order Information, Registration Information, or Contact Information to any
third party. We will not share or give any Order Information, Registration Information or Contact Information to
any third party, except that we may disclose such information (in whole or in part) to: (i) the issuers of the
credit cards used to make purchases on our web site to verify identity of purchasers and to process payment,
(ii) vendors that we use to provide certain services in connection with the processing and/or shipping of
product orders, such as UPS, (iii) a service or technology provider to provide and maintain the technical
operation of our web site, to protect the integrity and security of our web site or to correct technical
problems or malfunctions in its operation; (iv) our independent accountants, legal advisors and other advisors
and representatives to advise us in the operation of our web site or our business; or (v) to a judicial or other
governmental authority if applicable law requires such disclosure, or to defend against claims that may result
in our liability.
UPDATING AND/OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION:
You may update or delete your personally-identifiable information from our records at any time. If you
would like to correct, change or update your Registration Information or Contact Information, please send us an
e-mail at service@notneutral.com regarding your corrections, changes or updates. You may also correct, change or

e-mail notice to terminate your status or such notices, or (ii) by sending us an e-mail at
questions@notneutral.com, with your name, personal e-mail, password (if applicable) and request to be removed as
a registered user or to stop receiving e-mail notices and to have your Registration Information or Contact
Information deleted from our database.
SECURITY
We take reasonable steps to ensure that your Order Information, Registration Information and Contact
Information remains accurate, timely and secure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee or warrant the complete security of any
