What Information Does Organic Cotton Plus Collect?

We use cookies, which is a feature of your browser used to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user, but may be correlated with identity information in our log files. You can decline cookies through your browser preference options, but you may not be able to use some of our services properly as a result, such as the option to save your user name and password.

How Does Organic Cotton Plus Use The Data It Collects?
We use the Data collected from you primarily to process and fulfill your orders, to notify you of the status of your orders, to send our e-mail newsletter, or to send you targeted marketing information, special product offers, or other information that we believe might interest you. In every such e-mail, we will have instructions on how to unsubscribe and avoid receiving any future e-mails from us.
We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline - such as information related to your catalog subscription and orders - with the Data you have given us online, to provide a more customized experience for you when you visit our Site.

All of your personal information including your credit card information and sign-in password are stored in encrypted format at all times. This Website, and more importantly all user information, is further protected by a firewall based security system.
