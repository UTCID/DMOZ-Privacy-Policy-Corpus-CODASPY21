How Does Tervis Use "Cookies"?
We and some of our third-party service providers use "cookies". A "cookie" is a small text file written by an Internet server to a Website user's browser where information is exchanged between them, and which is stored on a computer's hard drive to allow us to recognize and track users on our Website to assist us in providing our customers with a productive online experience. Cookies enable us to store information about your use of our Website, such as the areas you visit and the length of your stay. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies and can be reset by using the 'Help' portion of the toolbar to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Should you choose to disable any cookies associated with the Website, you will not be able to take full advantage of all the Website's features, but you should be able to navigate the Website without difficulty.
Does Tervis Share My Information With Third Parties?
We may share certain personal information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example; we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain features, send e-mails, print our mailings, run our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, authorize and process your payments, and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness. These third-party service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes.
Your information may also be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as a part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of Tervis or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in corporate control.
Is My Information Safe With Tervis?
Protecting your personal information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. To support this technology, users must have an SSL-capable browser. While we use such sophisticated security technology to secure users' ordering information, user name, and password, we cannot guarantee that any electronic commerce is totally secure.
To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from 'http' to 'https.'
If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please place your order by phone at 1-866-886-2537.
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your user name, password, and any account information. It is important for you to be responsible and protect your user name, password, and computer against unauthorized users. It is important to sign off when you have completed using a computer accessible by others. Please see the Website Terms of Use for further details.
