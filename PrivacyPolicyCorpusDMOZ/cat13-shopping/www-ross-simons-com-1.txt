About Us
Our Privacy Policy
We do not share your credit card information with anyone other than the banks and processors required to process your transaction.
We currently contract with online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We provide information to a third party to provide financing on qualifying purchases through our web site, call center, and retail stores. Such financing offers are subject to credit approval. We use the services of third parties to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use our own Javascript and cookies as well as those provided by the third parties on this site. You have the right to decline our cookies and turn off JavaScript via your browser. By declining the use of cookies or JavaScript, you may not be able to use certain features on the Web Site. California residents click here for more information about your privacy rights.
The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our affiliates and marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with marketing partners, please contact Customer Service.
If you agree to receive email from our marketing partners, we will share with them your e-mail address and the information as described above, so they can send you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. Additionally, for each e-mail our partners send you, we request they include a description of the opt-out process to enable you to stop receiving future e-mails.
We also track aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site or used to contact you for marketing purposes.
We contract with third party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site, as well as to conduct direct email re-marketing and to send catalogs to our customers whom we think may be interested in our products and services. The third parties may collect information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. The third parties may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on our site or on other sites that you visit. The third parties may also pool the information that they collect with other sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving a catalog or an email. The information is collected through the use of a pixel tag or other proprietary software, which are the industry standard technologies used by most major web sites. If you do not wish for cookies or pixel tags to be placed on your computer, most commercially available web browsers permit you to set your preferences. By declining the use of cookies, pixels, or JavaScript, you may not be able to use certain features on the Web Site.
It is our policy not to accept an order online unless you provide us an email address, a physical address and a phone number. By making an online purchase, either directly through our website or through a third party payment service like PayPal or Apple Pay, you give us express and explicit permission to use your personally identifiable information (your name, your email address, your street address and your phone number) to send you emails, send you mail, and make phone calls regarding the status of your order as well as for marketing purposes.
If you do not want to receive promotional email from us in the future, you may unsubscribe. You can also contact Customer Service at 800-835-0919 or write to us at the address shown below, and tell us that you do not want to receive promotional email from our company.
If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, you may unsubscribe. You may also let us know by contacting Customer Service at 800-835-0919 or writing to us at the address shown below. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list.
Those who supply us with their telephone numbers may receive phone calls regarding items that might be of interest for future purchase. They may also receive phone calls from us with information regarding orders they have placed with us. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please contact Customer Service at 1-800-835-0919 or by writing to us at the address shown below. Please provide us with your exact name, address and correct phone number.
