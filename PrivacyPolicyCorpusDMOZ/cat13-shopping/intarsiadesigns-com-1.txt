Adverts, Privacy & Security
Theres some legal info were required to give, so heres the small print
Adverts:
If you click on an advert and buy something we get a small commission as a thank you from that company. It doesnt make any difference to what you pay, so what do you care? If you do care, dont click the ads, simple as that.
Privacy:
If you make a comment after a blog post, other visitors will be able to see it. Its a way to share your thoughts, ideas or helpful suggestions with other woodworkers.
If you send us info via the contact form, or email, thats between you and us and is completely confidential. Your email address and any other personal details will never be shared without your permission.
Security:
When you make a purchase you can choose to create an account or not. Its up to you. If you do, well keep details like your login, to make it easy for you next time you visit. If you dont want to do that, thats fine.
We never see your financial details. Ever. Thats all handled by Paypal and, as you can imagine, they have just about the most secure systems in the world. Theyre as safe as it gets.
If you have any questions, or want to know what info we have on file for you, just ask. Any time.
