Sharing Your Information
Wayside Gardens recognizes that gardeners may want products other than the high-quality plants, bulbs and accessories that we offer. Therefore, from time to time, Wayside Gardens may make customer information available to other reputable companies whose products or services we think you might find interesting. Please remember that, although Wayside Gardens endeavors to select only reputable companies who share our commitment to customer privacy, we are in no way responsible for the actions or policies of these other organizations.
Wayside Gardens may also from time to time contract with third party vendors to provide ads to our customers via the Internet or to send direct mail or catalogs to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. In order to do so, such vendor may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website using a “cookie”. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser or mobile device by websites, mobile apps, and advertisements that you access or use. This data is stored on your browser or mobile device and helps website and mobile apps to remember things about you to improve your experience with the website. Third-party vendors may then pool the anonymous information that they collect from this website with other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving direct mail or a catalog. If you do not wish for cookies to be placed on your computer, most web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place. However, please keep in mind that these technologies are an important part of how the website works; removing, rejecting or limiting the use of cookies or other similar technologies might affect the availability and functionality of the website.
If you do not want to share your information with such other companies, email us at info@waysidegardens.com, or send a postcard to: Mailing Address Don't Share, Wayside Gardens Company, 1 Garden Lane, Hodges SC 29695-0001.

Security Measures
We work hard to protect the security of your information by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the current standard for secure transactions over the Internet. There are some simple measures that you can take to promote protection of your information. First, to help protect the security of your account, do not share your password with others. Also, remember to "log-off" after using any of our on-line services when you have finished using the website. While Wayside Gardens strives to protect your information by using SSL and through measures to protect our system, such security cannot be ensured. Consequently, Wayside Gardens does not ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.
Encryption
What is Encryption?
Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble sensitive information while it is in transit to Wayside Gardens.
Please take a moment to read about the steps that we have taken to help protect your information and make your online transmissions safer. We also invite you to review the steps you can take to help protect yourself further.
How Does Encryption Work?
Encryption is based on a key that has two different parts. The public part and the private part. The public part of the key is distributed to those you want to communicate with. The private part is for the recipient's use only.
When you send personal information to WaysideGardens.com, you use Wayside Gardens's public key to encrypt your personal information. That means, if at any point during the transmission your information is intercepted, it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once Wayside Gardens receives your encrypted personal information, we use the private part of our key to decode it.
What Kind of Encryption Software Does Wayside Gardens Use?
Wayside Gardens currently uses the industry-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. But we continue to keep up with the current technologies in order to provide the best security for our customers.
What Information Does Wayside Gardens Encrypt?
Wayside Gardens encrypts all personal information you give us when you place an order online. Remember, if you feel uncomfortable providing any of this information online, please feel free to email one of our representatives at info@waysidegardens.com.
How Safe is Encryption Really?
Providing encrypted information online is as safe as doing it over the phone.
Privacy Policy Changes
WaysideGardens.com may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to better serve you. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
