DeliveryOur roses are dispatched on an overnight service or can be delivered on a date you request. We will do our very best to deliver on time but the service is not guaranteed and can be subject to conditions outside of our control.Minor/Superficial Damage: To rose plants during packing/transit to flowers, buds, leaves, stems will NOT be replaced or refunded as the plant still remains a first quality specimen & will quickly recover from such minor damage. We deliver online orders to UK and Europe only. However we can supply roses to the rest of the world IF you can supply the correct import licenses. Prices are on request. Please contact us to arrange overseas delivery.Only Bare Root roses can be delivered outside UK (Potted Roses are NOT available).See our Delivery Costs for postage charges.GuaranteeWe will replace any rose purchased in the autumn which has not grown by the 1st June 2019 provided we are satisfied that the rose was cared for in a proper way. No replacements or refunds can be given if loss is due to abnormal weather conditions bad planting lack of maintenance neglect planting in old rose beds and any other conditions beyond our control. In the event of a refund or replacement you will need to send us either the plant or a photograph (at cost to the customer).All descriptions colours and heights described in our catalogue are as accurate as possible. We believe all goods grown and sold by us to be of the description and kind specified at the time of sale but give no warrant expressed or implied as to the growth or productiveness.All goods must be inspected on arrival and should there be any cause for complaint please notify us within three days of receipt.Please NoteAt certain times of the year these rule apply.  Potted roses received during winter and early spring may be only recently potted and as such the compost will readily fall away when you come to plant.  This is quite normal, however you might find it beneficial to leave the rose in the pot a little longer to establish.
