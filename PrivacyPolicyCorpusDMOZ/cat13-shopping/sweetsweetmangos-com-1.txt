Website Visitors
Like most website operators, sweetsweetmangos collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. sweetsweetmangos's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how sweetsweetmangos's visitors use its website. From time to
time, sweetsweetmangos may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
sweetsweetmangos also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on sweetsweetmangos.com
blogs/sites. sweetsweetmangos only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.

Certain visitors to sweetsweetmangos's websites choose to interact
with sweetsweetmangos in ways that require sweetsweetmangos to gather

depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at sweetsweetmangos.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with sweetsweetmangos are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to

the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
