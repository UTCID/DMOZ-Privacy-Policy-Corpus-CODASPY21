Ensure your Birkenstock product is authentic by purchasing on www.birkenstock.com/us or through an authorized Birkenstock reseller.
We partner with the finest independent and national retailers in the country to provide the highest level of customer service.
COUNTERFEITS
When you choose a Birkenstock shoe or sandal you’re not only choosing footwear that will last for years with proper care, but you also get the reassurance that your footwear has been produced following our strict manufacturing standards, environmental practices and use of natural, responsibly-sourced materials.
All Birkenstock brand sandals and footbeds are made in Germany and our shoes and boots are made in Europe.
Counterfeits or copies are inevitably cheaply-made imitations that do not offer the same comfort, quality or assurances of genuine Birkenstock brand products. They can be made with questionable materials in unregulated factories.
AVOIDING COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT
The ONLY way to be absolutely sure that the item you are buying is a genuine Birkenstock is to purchase from Birkenstock.com/US or through an authorized Birkenstock dealer.
Be wary of websites that offer “Birkenstock” products on sale or at deep discounts. If you are offered a “Birkenstock” at a price that seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Any website that offers to ship you Birkenstock products from another country into the U.S. is operating illegally. You may receive a counterfeit product or nothing at all.
Bottom line, be cautious and ONLY shop from authorized retailers.
