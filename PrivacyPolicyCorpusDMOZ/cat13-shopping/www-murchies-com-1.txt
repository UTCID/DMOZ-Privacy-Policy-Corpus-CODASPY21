PRIVACY POLICY
We at Murchie's are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information you provide during online purchasing to process your online orders only. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Murchie's may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to either comply with law, enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or protect the rights, property or safety of Murchie's, our users, or others. We collect no other personal information about you other than what you provide during the checkout process.
PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED
In order to process your online order, we require your name, email address, shipping address and card billing address, credit card number, expiry date and security code from the back of the card, and a contact phone number. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
