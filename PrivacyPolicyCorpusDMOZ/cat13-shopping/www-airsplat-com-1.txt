AirSplat Shipping Policy & Free Shipping
AIRSPLAT SHIPPING POLICY
Orders are processed between 8AM - 5PM PST Monday through Friday. See our Return Policy for information on AirSplat's return policy.
Shipping and Billing Policy:
Free Shipping Promotion: To help save you money, we offer free FedEx SmartPost shipping for orders over $79 (with the use of coupon code ILUVAS). The free shipping promotion is only good for FedEx SmartPost shipping to the 48 contiguous states and has a weight limit for packages up to 10 lbs.
**Some orders requiring special care and may take an additional day to process. These orders are as follows: - Out of stock item orders- Orders for pre-order items- Wholesale orders or mail orders - High $ amount orders that require verification with financial institution - Orders requiring changes such as shipping method correction, item correction, address correction, etc.
Our shipping charges are calculated live from FedEx. This fee is paid directly to FedEx. Shipping may be calculated online through our shopping cart by selecting items and using our Shipping Calculator located on the View Cart page.
Total delivery time for your order is a two-part process - Part 1 is Processing Time: This is the time it takes from when you submit your order to when it will leave AirSplat’s warehouse. - Part 2 is FedEx In Transit Time: This time is determined by FedEx and is the time it takes the package to leave AirSplat and arrive at your door step. This time takes anywhere from 1-7 Business Days depending on the delivery address and shipping method selected. AirSplat offers Standard Overnight, 2-Day, Express Saver (3-Day), and standard Ground shipping methods. FedEx delivers to residential addresses Tuesday-Saturday and to commercial addresses Monday-Friday. To view a map of corresponding transit time with FedEx SmartPost, please refer to the map below.
Delivery Time Calculation and Example:
Order is placed on Saturday. Monday will be the next business day. The order will be processed and picked up from AirSplat by FedEx on Monday and it will leave the AirSplat facility. This is the end of processing time. In transit time is detailed below: - Next Day Air shipping method – package will deliver Tuesday - 2nd Day shipping method – package will deliver Wednesday - 3-Day Select shipping method – package will deliver Thursday - FedEx Ground shipping method – package will deliver in 1-5 business days depending on your zone (please reference map above)                - Pink Zone – package will deliver Tuesday                - Blue Zone – package will deliver Wednesday                - Orange Zone – package will deliver Thursday                - Green Zone – package will deliver Friday                - Purple Zone – package will deliver following Monday               - Grey Zone – package will deliver following Tuesaday
FedEx SmartPost – Delivery time is typically one day slower than FedEx Ground. This service combines the reliability of FedEx Ground with final delivery typically provided by the U.S. Postal Service (which means the final transit time may vary).
A confirmation e-mail with a tracking will be sent once the package has been shipped. Current shipment status may be checked with FedEx at 1-800-463-3339 or at www.fedex.com. Tracking information is available with FedEx 24 hours after package has left The AirSplat warehouse.
We accept Master Card, Visa, & Amazon Payment through our 256 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
We also accept money orders and personal checks. Payments by check or money order will require 7 days to process and clear. Unfortunately, orders using checks or money orders as payment will not be shipped until the payment clears with the bank, no exceptions. For orders with payment by check or money order, please proceed through the ordering process until a credit card is required. Please print out this page and mail it in along with your check or money order.  For mailing address, please email sales@airsplat.com.
FedEx does not ship to PO Box addresses. Orders that have PO Box shipping addresses will be contacted by a AirSplat representative.
AirSplat does not ship C.O.D.
For your protection, AirSplat only ships to verified billing addresses. Orders shipping to an address other than the verified billing address will have all addresses automatically screened for fraud and are subject to automatic cancellation if fraud is suspected.
Purchasers must be 18 or over, or purchasing with parental consent.
We track all IP addresses and report fraudulent activity. Please keep in mind, credit card fraud is a Federal Offense
Order Cancellation
If you wish to cancel an order you just placed, please email our order processing department at sales@airsplat.com. In the SUBJECT LINE of the email, please use the following text:
CANCEL ORDER SO# ______ and include your order number.
It is very important to follow this format to help ensure the proper cancellation of your order. Because AirSplat works very quickly to ship out all orders, we do not guarantee your order will be cancelled prior to it being processed and shipped.
