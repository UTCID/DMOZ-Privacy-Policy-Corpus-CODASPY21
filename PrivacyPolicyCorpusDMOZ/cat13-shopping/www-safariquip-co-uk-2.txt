We also use anonymous web statistics to help us improve the way the site works and make it easy to navigate. The statistics are provided by Google Analytics which also uses cookies. This information is general in nature and completely anonymous. At the time of writing this, the Information Commissioners Office (responsible for enforcing cookie regulations in the UK), uses Google Analytics in the same way we do.
In June 15 we are running a trial with Cloud-IQ using cookies to identify shopping basket abandonment points on this website.
