Terms & Conditions
This page is provided to let you know what our company policies are for our website. Please feel free to contact us if you have anymore questions regarding horizenhydroponics.com
SHIPPING POLICIES
Horizen Hydroponics typically uses UPS Home Delivery or 2 day* to deliver products for the contiguous 48 states. For Hawaii, Alaska or international the shipping price may vary due to the methods of delivery to that area. The website will not charge shipping for international orders or orders weighing over 150 LBS. Please contact us for a quote for international orders. Also note that UPS will not deliver to a P.O. Box. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping or would like a quote.
*IMPORTANT: We try our best to get same day orders processed if the order arrives in time for processing. However, when selecting Next Day, 2nd Day or 3 Day shipping options, please be advised that these options are promised from the time of shipping, not from the time the order was submitted. Please understand that it takes time to process the payment, pick your order from the warehouse, properly pack it in a box, label it and get it ready for shipping.
Free shipping is for ground shipments only. Expedited shipping is available on free shipping items. The cost difference between standard ground shipping and expedited shipping will be the customers responsibility if requested.
Due to the amount of internet fraud, we will only ship credit card sales to the billing address of the card holder. We also require a valid contact (phone number or E-mail address) to fulfill orders. Please call us if you would like to place an order to a different address. We apologize for any inconvenience.
SPECIAL ORDERS
Some products are shipped directly from the manufacturer. If you order an item that is out of stock, we will email you asking you if you would like to wait for it to come in and we will offer a comparable product if one is available. Special order pricing includes a special handling fee. They are only returnable if the item arrived damaged or if the product is defective. Also, we should add that tracking information for special orders is not emailed, but is available upon request.
BACK ORDERS AND SUBSTITUTIONS
We strive to keep our website up to date with current stock shortage information. Occasionally, an item sells out before we are able to update the website. Items temporarily out of stock will be shipped as soon as received back in stock. If a product is no longer available, we will offer to substitute a comparable or better item. If no comparable product is available, we will promptly refund your money.
