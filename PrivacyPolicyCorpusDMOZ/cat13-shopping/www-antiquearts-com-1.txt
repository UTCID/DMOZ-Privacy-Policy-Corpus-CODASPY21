This site is maintained and operated by
AntiqueArts.com, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIAS.COM Inc.
('TIAS'). TIAS is committed to respecting your privacy.
Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable
information (any information by which you can be identified),
you can be assured that it will only be used to support your
customer relationship with TIAS and our merchants.
This statement regarding the privacy of the
information you provide online covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice,
Access & Accuracy, Security, and Oversight.
Awareness
TIAS provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware
of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can
make about the way your information is collected and used.
On some TIAS web pages, you can make
requests, purchase products or ask to receive materials. On
these pages, we collect your name and contact information.
In order to tailor our subsequent
communications to you and continuously improve our products
and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us
with information regarding yourself, your experience with our
products and services, and your contact preferences.
How we use it
TIAS uses your information to better understand your
needs and to provide you with better service. Specifically, we
use your information to help you complete a transaction, to
communicate back to you, to update you on services, products
and benefits, and to personalize our web site for you.
From time to time, we may also use your
information to contact you for market research or to provide
you with marketing information we think would be of particular
interest.
Who we share it with
TIAS will not sell, rent, or lease your personally
identifiable information to others. Unless we have your
permission or are required by law, we will only share
the data you provide online with other TIAS entities
and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to
complete the activities described above. Such TIAS entities
and/or business partners, including those located in other
countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect
to the use of this data. To grant or deny permission to share
your information with others, contact postmaster@tias.com
Choice
TIAS will not use or share the personally identifiable
information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the
ones described above without letting you know and offering you
a choice.
If you wish to have your personally
identifiable information removed from our system, you can
contact us at postmaster@tias.com and
ask to be removed from our mailing list.
If you received a mailing from us, (a) your
email address is either listed with us as someone who has
expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving
information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you
have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing
relationship with us. We respect your time and attention by
controlling the frequency of our mailings.
Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to
cease receiving email from us, or to change your expressed
interests. If you wish to do this, simply follow the
instructions at the end of any email.
If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via
this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please
forward a copy of that email with your comments to abuse@tias.com for
review.
Access &
Accuracy
TIAS strives to keep your personally identifiable information
accurate.  If you wish to correct your information, you
may contact us at postmaster@tias.com
with corrected information.
You can review and change your current
mailing lists and personal information at any time by clicking

Security
TIAS is committed to ensuring the security of your
information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we
have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
we collect online. Read about why your order data is secure at
TIAS.
While you are shopping at TIAS, we may place a temporary
cookie on your computer system.    We use the
cookie for two purposes: to keep track of the number of users
accessing our site and for keeping track of your shopping
carts.   The only time we use cookies to correlate
with names is to tie the items ordered to the name of the
person doing the ordering in our shopping cart application.
Cookies are the most reliable and easiest to implement way of
doing this.  We do not share our cookies with other
sites, nor do we use cookies from other sites and when you
close your browser, the TIAS cookie will automatically be
deleted.  Click here for a
full explanation of our cookie processing.
