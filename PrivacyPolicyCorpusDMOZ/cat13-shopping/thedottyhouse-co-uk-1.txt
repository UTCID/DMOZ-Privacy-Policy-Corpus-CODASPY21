about their privacy policies.
Other Important Privacy Information
Below, you will find additional privacy information that you may find important.
European Privacy Rights

If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing;
You have a right to request from us, a “data controller” as defined in the law, access to and rectification of
your personal data;
You have a right to object to the processing of your personal data; and
You have a right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.
When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services/products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of The Dotty House as described in the “How We Use Personal Data” and “Reasons We Share Personal Data” sections above. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in “Where We Store and Process Personal Data” below.
Security of Personal Data
The Dotty House is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities held within two locations within the UK. When we transmit highly confidential data over the links to cloud apps into one app which your client can download.
Where We Store and Process Personal Data
Personal data collected by The Dotty House will be held securely and we take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable UK & EU law.

Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine the retention periods include:
How long is the personal data needed to provide the products and operate our business? Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.
Has The Dotty House adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?
