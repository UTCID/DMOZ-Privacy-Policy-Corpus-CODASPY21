If we become aware that a person under 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us without verifiable parental consent, we will remove such personally identifiable information from our files.
What Information Do We Collect?
Nutru Inc. will not collect any personally identifiable information about you through our website unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

The types of personal information collected include: name, shipping address, billing address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card information to complete purchases, and other general questions relating to areas of interest on our website.
How Do We Use Your Information?
We may use the information we request from you to notify you of Nutru Inc. products and services, sales and promotions, or other matters that may be of interest to you. The information we collect from you may be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries and/or agents, and may be used to provide services and other information that you request from us. Sharing your information enables our partners to follow up with you on information you request, to complete your transaction or to perform other services that you may request from us. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information. We may also use your information for market research purposes.
We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:
We have your consent to do so.
We need to share the information in order to provide the product or service you have requested.
We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Nutru Inc. to provide a product or service for you on our behalf and to provide other services, including, but not limited to, payment processing, shipping, order tracking, promotional fulfillment, and customer service. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us, unless they have your consent to do so.
We need to respond to a valid legal process. This includes a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, and any other instance when we believe we are required to do so by law.
Nutru Inc. may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our users with affiliates or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.
Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless you consent otherwise). Also, in the event that Nutru Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
How Do We Use Cookies?
We use "cookies" to help us provide a better user experience by measuring which website areas are of greatest interest. We may also use cookies when you register for further information.

How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?
In an endeavor to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical and electronic procedures to safeguard and secure personal information we collect. We cannot guarantee 100% security of any information that you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

How Do I Correct My Information or "Opt-Out"?
Please assist us in keeping your information current by notifying us of changes to your name, address, title, phone number or email address.
