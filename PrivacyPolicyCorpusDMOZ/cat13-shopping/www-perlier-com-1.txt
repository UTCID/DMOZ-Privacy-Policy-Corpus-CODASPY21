INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS:
This site, and all of its contents, including but not limited to articles, other text, photographs, images, illustrations, graphics, video material, audio material, including musical compositions and sound recordings, software, logos, titles, characters, names, graphics and button icons, excluding user content (collectively “proprietary material”), are protected by copyright, trademark and other laws of the united states, as well as international conventions and the laws of other countries.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY:
PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LISTED ON THE SITE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
Inventory information is generally available on the Site for domestic (U.S.) merchandise. This information can be used to estimate the likelihood that merchandise will be shipped with 2-4 business days after you place your order. However, we cannot guarantee that a product listed as "In stock" will actually ship right away, as inventory can change significantly from day to day. In rare cases, a product may be in stock when you place your order, and sold out by the time your order is processed. However, if an item that is marked "In stock" in your shopping cart when you place your order is sold out at the time your order is processed, we will notify you by e-mail or phone that your order will not be filled and your credit card will be refunded.
PROMOTIONAL CODES:
Occasionally, Perlier offers promotions through e-mails and other collateral sources. Upon agreeing to receive promotional materials from Perlier, you will receive e-mail promotions and offers that may include special codes for free shipping or other discount offers. To be eligible for these promotions, please sign up on the bottom of our website.
By using our Website, you acknowledge and agree that excessive abuse or misuse of promotional codes and other promotions may result in cancellation of the order or item. In order to allow fair redemption and distribution of promotions to our registered clients, Perlier may restrict redemption to one per person, per household, per email, per IP address or per order for any reason in Parlier’s sole discretion. Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or discontinue with or without notice. Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise shared. They are not redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason. Offers cannot be applied to previous purchases. Only one promo code can be redeemable per order.
SHIPPING POLICY:
Standard shipping generally is free with all orders of $100 or more, excluding taxes and after any promotional discounts are applied. Occasionally, Perlier offers promotions that feature free shipping with no minimum purchase requirement or a lower minimum purchase requirement.  Perlier reserves the right to modify its shipping policy at any time, without advance notice.
All orders will be processed within 48-72 hours of receipt. Processing time does not include weekends or federal holidays.
For an additional charge per address, we can expedite order processing to enable same day shipping or next day (contingent on the time your order was placed) for an additional $25 charge to most destinations in 4 business days (processing time included).
Standard Delivery
USPS Ground will typically deliver your package within 4 - 10 business days from receipt of your order. Most of the orders shipped with Standard USPS Ground option on the East Coast can be expected sooner (within 2 - 4 business days). To determine when your package will arrive, please determine the number of Shipping Days to your location from the map below and add 2-3 additional business days for order processing.
Hazardous Materials
Certain items considered Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT), which include alcohol-based products (e.g., perfumes, etc.), are required by the U.S. Department of Transportation to be shipped by ground-only transport due to air transport restrictions and regulations.
United States Postal Service has been selected as our premier delivery service. However, some packages may be delivered by an alternative carrier. For more information, please call our order department at (877)737-5353.
