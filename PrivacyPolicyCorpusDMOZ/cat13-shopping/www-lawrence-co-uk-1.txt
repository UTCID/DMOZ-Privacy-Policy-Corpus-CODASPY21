If the courier is unable to speak with you they will attempt to deliver the products for a second time on the following working day.

We will contact you to ask for this information.

We will not be responsible for supplying the products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.
This clause 15.15 only applies if you are a consumer .

17.1 You can always end your contract with us. Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:
(a) If what you have bought is faulty or mis-described you may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the product repaired or replaced), see clause 20;
(b) If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see clause 17.2;
(c) If you have just changed your mind about the product, see clause 17.3. You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions and you will have to pay the costs of return of any goods;
(d) In all other cases (if we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind), see clause 17.6.
17.2 Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do. If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) to (d) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:
(a) we have told you about an upcoming change to the product or these Terms which you do not agree to (see clause 9.2 and clause 10.4);
(b) we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;
(c) there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;
(d) you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong (including because we have delivered late (see clause 17.15)).
17.3 Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013). For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund. These rights, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, are explained in more detail in these Terms.
17.4 When you don't have the right to change your mind. You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of:
(a) products made to your requirements and specification including without limitation presses, press blankets and paper or metal cut to order;
(b) products sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them;
(c) sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software, once these products are unsealed after you receive them; and
(d) any products which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery
but this will not affect your legal rights as a consumer in relation to products that are damaged prior to delivery or not as described.
17.5 How long do I have to change my mind? You have 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the goods, unless:
(i) Your goods are split into several deliveries over different days. In this case you have until 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the last delivery to change your mind about the goods.
(ii) Your goods are for regular delivery over a set period. In this case you have until 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the first delivery of the goods.
17.6 Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind. If you do not have any other rights to end the contract (see clause 17.1), you can still contact us before it is completed and tell us you want to end it. If you do this the contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid by you for products not provided but we may deduct from that refund (or, if you have not made an advance payment, charge you) reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.
18. How to end the contract with us (including if you have changed your mind)
18.1 Tell us you want to end the contract. To end the contract with us, please let us know by doing one of the following:
(a) Phone or e-mail. Call us on 01273 260260 or e-mail us at artbox@lawrence.co.uk. Please provide your name, home address, details of the order (including the order number) and, where available, your phone number and e-mail address.

You must either return the goods in person to where you bought them, post them back to us or (if they are not suitable for posting) allow us to collect them from you. Please call us on 01273 260260 or e-mail us at artbox@lawrence.co.uk for a return label or to arrange collection.

18.3 When we will pay the costs of return. We will pay the costs of return:
(a) if the products are faulty or mis-described; or
(b) if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these Terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong
In all other circumstances you must pay the costs of return.
18.4 What we charge for collection. If you are responsible for the costs of return and we are collecting the product from you, we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection.
18.5 How we will refund you. We will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.
18.6 Deductions from refunds. If you are exercising your right to change your mind:
(a) We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.
(b) The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer delivery of a product within 1-2 working days of dispatch at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours of dispatch at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.
18.7 When your refund will be made. We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible. If you are exercising your right to change your mind and we have not offered to collect the products, your refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us. For information about how to return a product to us, see clause 18.2. In all other cases, your refund will be made within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind
19. Our rights to end the contract
19.1 We may end the contract if you break it. We may end the contract for a product at any time by writing to you if:
(a) you do not make any payment to us when it is due and you still do not make payment within 7 days of us reminding you that payment is due;
(b) you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to provide the products, for example, your delivery address; or
(c) you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the products to you or collect them from us.
19.2 You must compensate us if you break the contract. If we end the contract in any of the situations set out in clause 19.1 we will refund any money you have paid in advance for products we have not provided but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your breaking the contract.

Summary of your key legal rights
This is a summary of your key legal rights. These are subject to certain exceptions. For detailed information please visit the Citizens Advice website www.adviceguide.org.uk or call 03454 04 05 06.
The Consumer Rights Act 2015 says goods must be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality. During the expected life of your product your legal rights entitle you to the following:
· up to 30 days: if your item is faulty, then you can get a refund.
· up to six months: if your faulty item can't be repaired or replaced, then you're entitled to a full refund, in most cases.
· up to six years: if the item can be expected to last up to six years you may be entitled to a repair or replacement, or, if that doesn't work, some of your money back.
20.4 Your obligation to return rejected products. If you wish to exercise your legal rights to reject products you must either return them in person to where you bought them, post them back to us or (if they are not suitable for posting) allow us to collect them from you. We will pay the costs of postage or collection. Please call us on 01273 260260 or e-mail us at artbox@lawrence.co.uk for a return label or to arrange collection.
21. Price and payment
21.1 Where to find the price for the product. The price of the product (which includes VAT) will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the price of product advised to you is correct. However please see clause 21.5 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the products you have ordered.
21.2 Changes to our prices. Prices for our products may change from time to time but any changes will not affect orders you have already placed.
21.3 Our Invoice. An automated invoice is created upon sale of our products. The invoice displays our VAT number. A VAT breakdown of your order will be available upon request.
21.4 We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT. If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the product, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the product in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.
21.5 What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product's correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product's correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated in our price list, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.
21.6 When you must pay and how you must pay. We accept payment with Visa, Mastercard, American Experess and Paypal. You must pay for the products before we dispatch them. We will not charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch the products to you.
21.7 Credit card security. When you place an order for products via our Site, your credit card number will be encrypted using 128 bit encryption. Credit card numbers are only decrypted once they reach our computers. We do not hold credit card numbers in clear text on any website, including our Site.
21.8 We can charge interest if you pay late. If you do not make any payment to us by the due date we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 3% a year above the base lending rate of Barclays Bank Plc from time to time. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.
21.9 What to do if you think an invoice is wrong. If you think an invoice is wrong please contact us promptly to let us know and we will not charge you interest until we have resolved the issue.
21.10 If you are shopping from outside the UK. Your credit card company will convert the transaction into your own currency. All transactions will be charged in pounds sterling and will be converted at the applicable exchange rate by your credit card company.
22. Promotional offers, gift vouchers and promotional codes
22.1 A promotional offer, gift voucher and/or promotional code, unless otherwise specified, cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotional offer, gift voucher or promotional code.
22.2 All promotional offers, gift vouchers and promotional codes, unless otherwise specified, are non-transferable.
22.3 Items offered as a ‘Free Gift’ are only available while stocks last. No substitutions will be made. Gifts cannot be exchanged for goods or cash.

22.5 Gift vouchers do not contribute towards the value of an order with regard to the delivery costs.
22.6 If your order’s value is less than the value of the gift voucher you are using as payment then a credit note for the difference will be issued to you to use as payment on subsequent orders.
22.7 Once you have used a gift voucher as payment for an order of products you will not be able to use the gift voucher again. For this reason we advise that you destroy all redeemed vouchers to avoid confusion.
22.8 If your gift voucher becomes accidentally damaged or is lost, please contact us with the details of the original purchase, including the voucher number and we will be able to issue you with a duplicate. If you do not have the voucher number we will not be able to issue you with a duplicate.
22.9 If you decide to return products you purchased with a gift voucher, you will not receive a cash refund. A credit note will be issued to you to use as payment on subsequent orders.

In particular, we will not be responsible for ensuring that the products are suitable for your purposes.
24. Our liability if you are a consumer
This clause 24 only applies if you are a consumer.
24.1 We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.
24.2 We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the products for domestic and private use. If you use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption or loss of business opportunity.

For the purposes of this clause 25.3(b), Business Day means a day (other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday) in England when banks in London are open for the transaction of normal banking business.
(c) In proving the service of any notice, it will be sufficient to prove, in the case of a letter, that such letter was properly addressed, stamped and placed in the post and, in the case of an e-mail, that such e-mail was sent to the specified e-mail address of the addressee.
(d) The provisions of this clause shall not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action.
26. Other important terms
26.1 We may transfer this agreement to someone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. We will contact you to let you know if we plan to do this. If you are unhappy with the transfer you may contact us to end the contract within 14 days of us telling you about it and we will refund you any payments you have made in advance for products not provided.
26.2 You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else (except that you can always transfer our warranty). You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree to this in writing. However, you may transfer our warranty at clause 14 to a person who has acquired the product. We may require the person to whom the warranty is transferred to provide reasonable evidence that they are now the owner of the relevant product
26.3 Nobody else has any rights under this contract (except someone you pass your warranty on to). This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its Terms, except as explained in clause 26.2 in respect of our warranty. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these Terms.
26.4 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
26.5 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
26.6 If you are a consumer, please note that these Terms are in addition to and do not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.
26.7 If you are a consumer, please note that these Terms are governed by English law. This means a contract for the purchase of products through our Site and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by English law.

However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.
26.8 If you are a business, a contract and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.
