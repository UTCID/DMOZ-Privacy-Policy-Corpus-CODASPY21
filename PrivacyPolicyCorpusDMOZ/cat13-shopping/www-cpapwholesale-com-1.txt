CPAP Ordering Information
Privacy Policy
CPAP Wholesale does not rent, sell, or distribute any personal information including email addresses to anyone. This information is used strictly for order processing and communication purposes. We utilize the latest technology to ensure that your information is kept safe and out of the hands of unauthorized individuals. If you feel that your personal information has been compromised, please contact us immediately at sales@cpapwholesale.com or by phone at 888-598-8515.
Return/Warranty Information
The manufacturer warranty covers all parts and labor for 2 years on all CPAP machines, and covers 90 days on all CPAP masks for any manufacturer defects. This does not cover any damage caused by the consumer such as, but not limited to, a dropped machine, water damage, a stepped-on mask, or damage caused by house pets. The customer is responsible for all shipping charges in a warranty or exchange situation.
Due to FDA regulations, once any product is taken out of its original packaging, it is no longer returnable. If the product is defective, and you have the original packaging, contact us within the warranty period to obtain a return authorization number. We will then exchange the product. No substitutes allowed.
Due to FDA regulations, once a CPAP, BiPAP, or Auto machine has been used, it is no longer returnable. If the product is defective, and you have the original packaging, contact us within the warranty period to obtain a return authorization number and we will then exchange the product. No substitutes are allowed.
Non-defective, unopened returns will not be accepted without prior authorization. Please contact us within 30 days of the purchase date to receive a return authorization number. Any item returned without prior authorization or after 30 days will not be credited.
All authorized returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee. Any order for a CPAP machine that has to be canceled because no prescription is provided is subject to a 15% restocking fee. Shipping charges are non-refundable.
International Shipping
The buyer is responsible for any tariff, duty, taxes, handling fees, customs clearance charges, etc. required by your country for importing consumer goods. We do not collect this beforehand, and cannot give you an estimate of the cost - charges vary around the world.
As an international consumer, please do your research to ensure there are no surprise charges when clearing your package through customs, and to have an idea of what the additional cost may be. If you are unfamiliar with customs fees and charges, please speak to your local postal or customs office for more information. It is your full responsibility to verify the customs, duties charges, and procedures in your country prior to placing your order.
If customs fees and charges are refused at the time of delivery, your order will be returned and you will not receive a refund for shipment costs.
Prescription Requirements
A prescription is required on all machine purchases and for all ResMed masks, humidifiers, and machines.
The prescription must state the pressure(s) that you machine is to be set at.
If purchasing a CPAP machine, your prescription must state one pressure setting.
If purchasing an Auto CPAP machine, your prescription must state two pressures; a low pressure setting and a high pressure setting.
If purchasing a BiLevel (BiPAP) machine, your prescription must state two pressures; an inhalation pressure and an exhalation pressure.
If you purchase a machine and are unable to provide a prescription, you will be charged a 15% restocking fee.
