Inclusive Technology is a global provider for educational institutions of fun, accessible games, activities, and tools designed specifically for young children and those with learning difficulties ("Services").
This privacy policy ("Policy") sets out how Inclusive Technology processes personal information collected through our websites (including www.helpkidzlearn.com and www.inclusive.co.uk) (each a ""Website"). It is important that you read this Policy together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This Policy supplements any additional notices and is not intended to override them.
Inclusive Technology is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. Accordingly, we adhere to the EU General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) ("GDPR") and any applicable industry and regulatory guidelines. We regularly review and update our Policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of personal information in our possession.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office ("ICO"), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
Personal Information we collect

Without limitation, Inclusive Technology may collect any of the following personal information (which is information that identifies you or relates to you as an identifiable person) from time to time:
Information you provide us
We collect personal information on the Website when Users choose to reveal it to us.

Where you choose to provide it, we may collect sensitive personal information on the Website, such as dietary requirements, sensory and diagnosis information, (or other health related data).
You may also provide us with your personal information on the publicly accessible blogs on our Website. You should be aware that any personal information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at info@helpkidzlearn.com or inclusive@inclusive.co.uk. In some cases we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Sharing and disclosing your personal information
Other than as expressly set out in this Policy or as otherwise required or permitted by law, we will not share, sell, or distribute any of your personal information without your consent.
Inclusive Technology may, from time to time, employ the services of other persons for dealing with matters that may include, but are not limited to, payment processing, delivery of purchased items, search engine facilities, data hosting, advertising, marketing, and sales. We take measures to require such third parties to protect the confidentiality of your personal information in accordance with the standards described in this Policy.
In addition, where you have contacted us on behalf of your employer, we may share certain personal information with your employer, where required in order to provide the Services requested.
Because aggregated or anonymised information does not personally identify you, we may use it for any purpose. If we combine anonymised or aggregated data with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information according to this Policy.
Marketing
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time at info@helpkidzlearn.com or inclusive@inclusive.co.uk.
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the Inclusive Technology group of companies for marketing purposes.
International transfers
We provide our Services globally and as such, subject to applicable law, may transfer your information to selected third parties outside the country where you are located and where information protection standards may differ. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information is only transferred once adequate safeguards are in place.

Inclusive Technology has no control over third party websites you may go to from our Website and is in no way responsible for the content thereof. This Policy does not extend to your use of those websites. Users are encouraged to read the privacy policy or statement of other websites prior to using them.
Changes of Business Ownership and Control
Inclusive Technology may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of Inclusive Technology. Personal information provided by Users will, where it is relevant to any part of our business so transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Policy, be permitted to use the personal information for the purposes for which it was originally supplied to us.
In the event that any personal information submitted by Users is to be transferred in such a manner, as required under applicable law, you will be contacted in advance and informed of the changes.
Your Rights in relation to your Personal Information
You are entitled to know what personal information we hold about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes/corrections to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date.
You can access the personal information that we hold on you by logging into your account and making any changes to your personal information as necessary. You are also entitled to request that we give you access to, correct or delete any personal information that we hold about you, subject to any lawful exemptions. You can also ask us to transfer the personal data we hold about you to another person, or delete your account altogether.

Where you have requested that we provide your personal information to you, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
