Privacy Policy Statement
:
*- We are NOT in the process of sharing your purchase information
with ANYONE and you can remove your email address from our list
at any time.
Most companies will give you several pages of legal sounding words to
describe their privacy policy.    Instead let's say it in
plain language.   We value your privacy, and we treasure our
list of customers.     If you have signed up for one
of our email newsletters you may receive email from us from time to
time.  Anytime you want to stop receiving information from us, just
let us know.
*- In certain situations we may share limited information.  We
think you'll agree that sharing "limited information" in unusual
situations (below) is acceptable.  These situations seldom occur.
Information may be revealed to a third party if:
there was a credit card problem or dispute in relation to a specific
order.
your order was lost in the mail (we might have to describe your
order when filing an insurance claim with the post office or UPS)
in a very rare situation such as if a court-of-law ordered us to
provide such information.
Advertisements and other websites.
The above privacy policy applies to this website only.  Some web
page you will find here and other information seen may be an
advertisement for a different website or product.  Understandably,
we have no control over other websites or what they do with information
you provide to them.
This includes any websites links that might be displayed in our frames
(border), such as WalMart or Amazon.  Understandably, our privacy
policy does not apply when you click a link and go to some other
website.  If you have a concern about other websites, please look
at their privacy policies.
