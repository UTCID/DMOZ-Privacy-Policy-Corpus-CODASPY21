Security
DISScards uses PayPal, a trusted and widely used third party payment system.
Upon purchasing a card or product from DISScards, you will be automatically routed into the PayPal encrypted site for final checkout.
Security is the core of the PayPal business, and they take that responsibility very seriously. Every precaution is taken to ensure that your information, your transactions, and your funds are protected by their fraud protection policies, site encryption technology, and even account insurance.
So chill out, your personal information is safe!
For a more detailed explanation of how PayPal protects your money and personal information, see the PayPal full Security Policy when checking out.

disclosed or used in any way for the purposes of marketing or bothering you.
We understand there's enough annoying things out there. We are part of the
solution, not part of the problem.
Are you a Rockstar? Do
you wanna be one?
