Victorie Inc. Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. To
better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your
information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it
available on our homepage.
Information We Collect:
When you make a purchase or attempt to make a
purchase through our website, we collect certain information from you,
including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information,
email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as Order
Information.
Cookies and Navigational & Device Information:
We automatically collect certain information about
your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time
zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
Additionally, as you browse our website, we collect information about the
individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search
terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with
the website. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
Navigational Device Information.
We collect Navigational & Device Information using
the following technologies:
Cookies are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often
include an anonymous unique identifier.
Log files track actions occurring on our website, and collect data including
your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit
pages, and date/time stamps. They do not include your name, email address,
address or any other personally identifying information.
When we talk about "Personal Information" in this
Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Navigational & Device Information
and Order Information.
On some pages, you can submit
information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want
it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's
address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:
Name
Address
Phone Number
(etc.)
The Way We Use Information:
Communicate with you and complete your order.
We use the information you provide
about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm
delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the
extent necessary to complete that order.
When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, we may also provide
you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
We use Navigational & Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to
improve and optimize our website.
Sharing Your Personal Information
We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your
Personal Information, as described above. For example, we use authorize.net to
securely process credit card orders.
We may also share your Personal Information to
comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise
protect our rights.
As described above, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with
Victorie Inc. advertising communications we believe may be of interest to you.
Finally, we do not share the
personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to
the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out.
Your Rights
If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal
information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be
corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please
contact us.
Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your
information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if
you make an order through our website), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate
business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information
will be transferred outside of Europe, including to the United States.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access,
maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put
in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Data Retention
When you place an order through our website, we will maintain your Order
Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this
information.
Mailing List Subscriptions
Our mailing list requires subscribers to opt in. You are welcome to unsubscribe
at any time.
Our Commitment To Children's
Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very
young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain
information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part
of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
Changes
We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory
reasons.
How To Contact Us
Should you have other questions or
concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 1-360-457-5434 or send
