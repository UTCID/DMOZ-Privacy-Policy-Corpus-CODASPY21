If we cannot resolve the matter informally, you and we each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify ("Agreement to Arbitrate").
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate, which shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by these Terms.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website.
The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.

The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Walgreens users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Walgreens user to the extent required by applicable law.
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.You and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.
Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s).
Any relief awarded shall not affect our other users.You can choose to reject the Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a signed opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice") within 30 days after the date you first access the Services or accept any subsequently published version of these Terms.

You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Walgreens, Attn: Litigation and Regulatory Law Department, 104 Wilmot Road, MS 1431, Deerfield, IL 60015.

If you breach any provision of these Terms, you may no longer use the Services.
If these Terms or your permission to use the Services is terminated by us for any reason, the agreement formed by your acceptance of these Terms will nevertheless continue to apply and be binding upon you in respect of your prior use of the Services and anything relating to or arising from such use.
