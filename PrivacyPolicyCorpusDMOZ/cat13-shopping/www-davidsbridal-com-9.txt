Alterations & Store Services
Alterations Each David's Bridal location has on-site alterations experts so you can personalize your dress and get the perfect fit. In addition to our wedding dresses, bridesmaid dresses, and party dresses, we now offer alterations on any of the garments in your wardrobe, no matter where they were purchased.
David's Bridal Limited Alterations Policy: If our standard alterations on a garment purchased from David’s Bridal do not result in the fit you agreed upon at time of fitting, we will do another round of alterations at no charge to you. If our alterations damage a garment purchased from David’s Bridal, we will fix the damage or replace the garment at no charge to you. Because of the variability in construction, materials and quality of garments purchased from third parties, we cannot extend this alterations policy to cover alterations on garments that were not purchased at David’s Bridal.
LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR EXPERT ALTERATIONS >
Store Services In additional to expert alterations, our stores can help you coordinate your wedding with dyeable shoes and handbags, tuxedos, invitations, and more. We also offer professional gown cleaning and preservation for after the big day. Payment options include the David's Bridal credit card and layaway.
Gown Preservation Every David's Bridal location offers gown preservation kits at a special discount for our customers. Just send in your gown and it will be cleaned, preserved, and returned to you in 3 weeks or less. Available in or online.
Looking for a great photographer, caterer, florist or other wedding professionals? Visit our Wedding Planning section for great tips, along with local and national vendor partners.

Ordering Dresses Bridal Gowns: Every David's Bridal store carries hundreds of bridal gowns so you can try on your size to make it easier to find your dream dress. We stock sizes 0-18 and 14W-26W in White and Ivory, with select styles available in additional colors and up to size 30W. If your selection is not in stock in your color or size, ask your stylist whether it is available as a special order. If available, your prepaid special order can usually be shipped to your store within 6-12 weeks of order confirmation.*
Bridesmaid Dresses: All David's Bridal bridesmaid dresses are available in sizes 2-26, with select styles in sizes 2-30. Your bridesmaids may visit any David's Bridal location to see the style and/or color you have chosen and to try it on to determine the appropriate size. For your convenience, David's offers a range of styles and sizes in stock so your bridesmaids can purchase them with no ordering delays. David's Bridal also offers special order bridesmaid dresses, generally shipped to the store within six to eight weeks.
Contact your local store if you have questions about special orders.
*Delivery times may vary. Add 2 weeks to the delivery in Alaska and Canada. Please ask your stylist for the delivery time frame for the styles you have chosen and note that this begins when all the dresses in your party are fully paid and the order is placed. Remember to also allow time for alterations.
