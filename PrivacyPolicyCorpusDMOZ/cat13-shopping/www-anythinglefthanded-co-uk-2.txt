Becky Gunn says:
June 24, 2010 at 2:48 pm
I am a left-handed teacher.
Having taught from 1st grade through the college level, I haver watched many students struggle due to lack of help with their left-handedness. I want to teach a seminar at my school for teachers and parents.
It may be open to the public.
There will be a small charge for the seminar to cover the costs for me and the school. If it is successful and their is a call for more classes, I might do that.
I want to be able to use your site and the informtion you provide, especially the video.
How do I go about getting permission?
I would like to do this in August or September of this year. I want to give you full credit.
I will also be handing out a list of links to sites for parents and teachers to access on their own.
Thank you,
Becky Gunn
