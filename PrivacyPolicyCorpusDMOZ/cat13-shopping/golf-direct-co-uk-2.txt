Terms & Conditions
Golf Direct Online is a trading style of Golf Direct Online Ltd, Registered in the UK and Wales under the number 08751435
This website is operated by Golf-Direct.co.uk (referred to as “Golf Direct/Golf-Direct.co.uk/we/our/us”). As user of this website (referred to as “you/your”) you acknowledge that any use of this website including any transactions you make (“use/using”) is subject to our terms and conditions below.
Please:
read through these terms and conditions carefully before using this website
print a copy for future reference.
also read our Privacy section regarding your personal information.
1. General
1.1 We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time. Any such changes will take effect when posted on the website (see date at the top) and it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions on each occasion you use this website and your continued use of the website shall signify your acceptance to be bound by the latest terms and conditions.
1.2 If you are not a consumer, you confirm that you have authority to bind any business on whose behalf you use this website
2. Order process
2.1 Please see How To Shop section for information on how to place an order. All orders that you place on this website will be subject to acceptance in accordance with these terms and conditions.
2.2 The ‘confirmation’ stage sets out the final details of your order. Following this, we will send to you an order acknowledgement email. Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Golf Direct.
2.3 Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place on dispatch to you of the products ordered unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it (please refer to Guarantees and Returns Policy).
2.4 We do not file details of your order for you to subsequently access direct on this website, and therefore, please print out these terms and conditions and the order acknowledgement for your own records. If you wish to obtain specific details of your previous orders please Contact Us.
3. Delivery
3.1 All goods must be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over on delivery.
3.2 Delivery charges and estimated timescales are specified in Shipping section and also when you place an order. We make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timescales, however delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors. Golf Direct shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within estimated timescales.
3.3 Once a tracking number has been emailed to you (a copy is also available online in your account section), it is your responsibility to monitor and track the status of your parcel. If you notice any problems for example – Address Not Found, Failed Delivery, Recipient Absent etc then please contact us immediately so we can assist in resolving any problems. Failed-delivery parcels are normally held at a local depot for a maximum of five days before returning back to us. It is therefore your responsibility to contact us in good time to advise us of this situation in order to stop any return. We take no responsibility for parcels returned to us after successive delivery attempts and any return charges will be passed to you.
3.4 If the package has not been accepted or rejected besides the valid reasons (see 3.3) during delivery, the respective courier will make a return charge to Golf Direct. This charge will be required to be paid before processing a re-delivery or will be retained if order has been cancelled.
3.5 In the event where deliveries have failed due to incorrect address specified or if no one is available to accept delivery at time when courier attempts to deliver goods, the courier will hold the goods at their depot for a small period of time (anytime between 3-5 days). If a card has been left by the courier requesting you to contact them, you are requested to contact them to arrange a re-delivery at same address at a suitable time. Failure to do so quickly (normally within 2 working days) may cause the parcel to be returned back to us. Although every effort is made to ensure goods are delivered to you in good time and at address specified, certain circumstances may fail deliveries (for e.g. unable to find address or no one to accept parcel etc). In order to solve such problems during delivery or if you wish to advise us of change of delivery address after goods have been shipped, you are requested to contact us on first occasion. Normally a charge is incurred for amendments of delivery addresses which can be accepted by yourself or you may simply arrange to collect the goods from the courier depot where possible without any charges. Failure to do so or if you advise a change of address directly with the courier without notifying us will incur an additional charge which will be passed on to you unless we have already authorised this change with the courier.
3.6 Upon delivery it is your responsibility to check package and its contents thoroughly. If you notice any signs of security tape damage, theft or attempt for theft, damage of goods or any unacceptable condition of package and its contents you are requested not to accept the package. If you are willing to accept the package then you are requested to sign on the delivery note what you have noticed for e.g. Goods Damaged or Theft Attempt etc. FAILURE to comply with these terms will NOT enable you to make any claims against the above conditions and NO credit will be issued.
3.7 Risk of loss and damage of products passes to you on the date when the products are delivered or on the date of first attempted delivery by us.
4. Payment
4.1 We take payment from your card at the time we receive your order, once we have checked your card details and stock availability. Goods are subject to availability. In the event that we are unable to supply the goods, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the goods and if no goods have been already dispatched. Refund of payment does not apply to personalised, custom-made or custom fitted goods.
4.2 While we try and ensure that all prices on our website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of goods you have ordered we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund.
4.3 Payment can be made by any method specified in Payment Methods. For information about secure on-line ordering see Privacy.
4.4 All prices include VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rates but exclude delivery charges, unless expressly stated. (for further details including Express delivery charges see Shipping).
5. Returns, Cancellations and Substitutions
5.1 All Golf Direct products are guaranteed against manufacturing defects for a minimum of 12 months. Your statutory rights are unaffected. Please note all shipping charges that have incurred prior cancellation of your order will be retained to cover costs if order has been cancelled for no reason or if user does not accept a replacement.
5.2 Sometimes the product specifications from the manufacturer may change, in which case we will do our best to offer you a substitute of the same or better quality at the same price. If you are not happy with the replacement you can return it in accordance with our 14 day money back guarantee. Where applicable, you may cancel your order in accordance with your rights under the Distance Selling Regulations. Please note any courier charges will be retained where the fault has not been or resulted from Golf Direct.
5.3 All sizes and measurements are approximate but we do try to make sure that they are as accurate as possible.
5.4 Please note that NO REFUND will be passed for goods that are faulty or defective after 14 Days. Golf Direct will replace or exchange all faulty products available from the manufacturer, and if the identical size or model is no longer available then we will exchange for an equivalent make/model or offer you credit vouchers which can be used to purchase products from our website. See section 5.7 for information on how guarantees work on returned products.
5.5 If you receive goods that you feel are not as stated, do not satisfy your requirements, or not up to your standards (for e.g. superficial marks on packaging or product, dust etc) we are happy to pass refund on the value of the goods if you have advised us of this within 14 days of delivery and only once we have received your goods back in its original condition. Please note that all delivery costs already incurred will be retained before passing refund. Please note that we offer a discounted shipping rate structure to offer you great value and in order to continue doing so we are unable to pass you full refund as the actual shipping cost will be retained before passing refund.
5.6 Although every effort is made in checking all goods before dispatch, in some occasions incorrect or faulty goods may be received for which we do apologise for any inconveniences caused. Golf Direct will assure that all such problems are solved and do request your co-operation in doing so. Once an incorrect or faulty delivery has been received it is your responsibility to complete the online returns procedure (after which further instructions will be emailed back) or to advise us of this within 7 working days after delivery. Once a return-request has been accepted, you are requested to send goods back to us (via your local post-office or courier or whichever more cost-effective). The return-shipping cost incurred to you will be settled in form of refund or credit vouchers only for the value of the shipping amount that you paid at time of ordering (as similarly operated when returned in-store). If the cost of sending goods back to us is reasonably high, then we do request you to contact us where we can assist in coming to an agreement to solve problem in a cost-effective manner for both parties. In some circumstances we may arrange a collection from your address once a collection charge has been accepted by yourself (available only within mainland U.K. ). We will do our level best to compensate you for your costs in form of goods or gift vouchers, however we regret to advise you that we are unable to compensate you fully where the cost of return is not viable.
5.7 Although we stock the best quality products, sometimes faults may be discovered after purchase. Golf Direct offer a guarantee against manufacturer faults for a maximum of 1 year from the date of first delivery. Faulty products are required to be sent back for fault examination. If a genuine manufacturer fault is established, we will send the replacement that may be either repaired or exchanged. If an identical replacement is not available, we will offer an alternative product of similar value. However if for any reason you are not happy to take the replacement, we will offer you eVouchers that may be used to purchase goods from our website. To avoid doubt, all products exchanged, swapped, or purchased with eVouchers (only applies to vouchers issued from a return), will be guaranteed for only the balance of the initial 12 month period.
5.8 All electric trolleys purchased from our website are covered by warranty only within the United Kingdom . Therefore if these products experience any defects or problems during operation whilst outside the United Kingdom , they will have to be sent back to us at your own cost where we will assess the problem and arrange for it to be fixed or replaced within the warranty period. A reshipping cost will be required for items to be shipped back out to you, which will be agreed prior dispatch.
5.9 Most manufacturers will void the product warranty if it has been altered in any way. For example if the shaft of the club has been altered, or if the product has been altered without our consent. Due to the high technical nature of golf clubs, most manufacturers will only cover you against manufacturer defects if they have been customized by the manufacturer or through Golf Direct. In our experience we have found that use of unauthorised fitting centres or inexperienced club-fitters could result in a poor quality product and therefore more likely to attain a defect.
