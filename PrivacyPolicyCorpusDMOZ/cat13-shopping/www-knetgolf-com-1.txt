Disputes
In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and LostGolfBalls.com. agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to use of this Site or purchase of any product from this Site (referred to as a “Claim”) will be resolved as follows:
A. Informal Resolution:
You and LostGolfBalls.com. will first attempt to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither you nor LostGolfBalls.com. may start a formal Arbitration proceeding for at least 60 days after one party notifies the other party of a Claim in writing.
SEE UNDER THE HEADING “EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS; CONSUMER PROTECTION NOTICE”
BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION.
B. Formal Resolution by Arbitration:
READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION. You agree that any dispute controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions, the applicability of these Terms and Conditions to the use of this Site, or purchase of any LostGolfBalls.com. or other products on this Site, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms and Conditions, or the determination of the scope or applicability of arbitration shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act.
If you and LostGolfBalls.com. cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim asserted by either party will be resolved only by binding arbitration. By agreeing to arbitration, both you and LostGolfBalls.com. understand and agree that all disputes shall be decided by an arbitrator and that you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. Instead of suing in court, both you and LostGolfBalls.com. each agree to settle disputes (except certain small claims) only by arbitration. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The rules in arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms and Conditions as a court would.
The arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions will govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state. If you decide to initiate arbitration, LostGolfBalls.com. agrees to pay the arbitration initiation fee and any additional required deposit required by JAMS to initiate your arbitration. You and LostGolfBalls.com. agree to pay the costs of the arbitration proceeding provided however that if you are a consumer you shall not be required to pay more than $250.00 of the fees or such amount as the JAMS Rules may later prescribe. All other fees, such as attorneys’ fees and expenses of travel to the arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The arbitration will be held in Harris County, Texas, unless you and LostGolfBalls.com. both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. To initiate arbitration, you or LostGolfBalls.com. must do the following things:
(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. (2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS [to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, 8401 N. Central Expressway, Suite 610, Dallas, TX 75225].(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Special Rules in the arbitration proceeding. (i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor LostGolfBalls.com. shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER. Accordingly, you and LostGolfBalls.com. agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our Arbitration. A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitrations. Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all Claims under these Terms and Conditions, you may assert an individual Claim in small claims court in lieu of Arbitration.
C. Time to Bring Your Claim:
Any Claim you may have directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions or the Site (including the purchase of any product via the Site) must be commenced within one (1) year after the Claim arises.
