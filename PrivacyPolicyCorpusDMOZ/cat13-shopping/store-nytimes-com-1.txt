Your request to not sell your data will be stored for this browser and device
If you clear your cookies, your preference will be forgotten. As a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. While The New York Times Company does not “sell” personal information of its readers as the term “sell” is traditionally understood, “sell” under the CCPA is broadly defined. To learn more, review the text below.
The New York Times Company does not sell personal information of its readers as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. But “sell” under the CCPA is broadly defined. It includes the sharing of personal information with third parties in exchange for something of value, even if no money changes hands. For example, sharing an advertising or device identifier to a third party may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.
To the extent The New York Times Company “sells” your personal information (as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA), you have the right to opt-out of that “sale” on a going-forward basis at any time. To exercise this right, click the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link in the footer of our website or under your “Account,” which you have already done. You can also submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at privacy@nytimes.com with the subject line “California Resident - Do Not Sell.”
Once you have opted out, you will see a change to “We No Longer Sell Your Personal Information.” If you have an account with certain Times Services (specifically nytimes.com, cooking.nytimes.com, nytimes.com/crosswords, the New York Times app, the New York Times Cooking app and the New York Times Crossword app) and are logged in, we will save your preference and honor your opt-out request across browsers and devices so long as you remain logged in. If you are not logged in, or do not have an account with any Times Services listed above, your opt-out of the “sale” of personal information will be specific to the browser or device from which you have clicked “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” and until you clear your cookies (or local storage in apps) on this browser or device.
If your browser or device is using a “do not track” setting, we will detect it and honor it on that specific browser or device only. If you wish to have a “do not track” experience across all of your browsers and devices, please make sure that all of your browsers and devices are set on “do not track.”
After you opt out of the “sale” of your personal information, we will no longer “sell” your personal information to third parties (except in an aggregated or de-identified manner so it is no longer personal information), but we will continue to share your personal information with our service providers, which process it on our behalf. Exercising your right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information does not mean that you will stop seeing ads on our sites and apps.
To opt-out of interest-based advertising as much as technically possible, go to “How Do I Manage Trackers” in our Cookie Policy. To opt out of the “sale” of your personal information from participating companies, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance website or apps. We do not control these opt-out mechanisms and are not responsible for their operation.
You can designate someone else to make a request on your behalf. To protect your information, we will ask for a signed permission from you authorizing the other person to submit a request on your behalf. We will contact you to verify your identity before we respond to your authorized agent’s request.
After 12 months, we may ask you if you want to opt into the “sale” of your personal information.
For further information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

Terms of Sale
The New York Times Store Terms of Sale
Last Updated on 12-June-2017
These Terms of Sale (these “Terms of Sale”) describe the terms that apply to the sale and purchase of products on The New York Times Store operated by The New York Times Company ("NYTimes" or "we" or "us").
If you are making a purchase from outside the United States, these Terms of Sale may not apply to you. We are not liable to you for any claims related to purchases made through third parties. Please contact the third party directly.
By using and making a purchase at store.nytimes.com and other NYTimes products, you are agreeing to these Terms of Sale, including the Return Policy, which is a part of these Terms of Sale.
1. CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY
For more information about our order cancellation policy, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
For more information about our product return policy, please visit our Return Policy.
2. GENERAL TERMS
2.1 BILLING
You must provide truthful and accurate billing and registration information. By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the item(s) ordered. You will be responsible for all expenses we incur in connection with the collection of unpaid amounts, including court costs, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees and any other associated costs.
We will process your purchase as promptly as possible.
We reserve the right to reject any order or purchase at any time.
2.2. PRICING
Applicable prices for your order, including applicable sales taxes and shipping charges, will be stated during the order process.
For more information about our promotional discounts, including shipping promotions, please visit our FAQs.
All prices are in United States Dollars.
We reserve the right to change prices and shipping charges at any time.
We collect sales tax on product purchases (and in some locations, delivery charges) in locations where we have a legal obligation to do so. Those taxes are calculated based on the state and local taxes applicable in the location where the order is being shipped. Applicable sales taxes and shipping charges are displayed before completion of your purchase.
2.3 ORDER ACCEPTANCE
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. We may decline orders even after we have confirmed your order.
We will charge your credit card or other payment method at checkout. Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department.
We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting your order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is canceled after your payment method has been charged, we will issue a refund to your payment method you used to place your order.
2.4 PRICING AND AVAILABILITY INFORMATION AND ERRORS
While we strive to provide accurate product and pricing information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. We reserve the right to discontinue or change prices and product specifications without prior notice. Products are available while supplies last. Inadvertent errors in advertised prices are not binding on us, and may be adjusted at any time.
In the event that an item is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information, we shall have the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any orders placed for that item. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our sole discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Special offers or discounts may not be combined.
2.5 QUANTITY LIMITS
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by the same account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. We will notify you if we apply any such limits. We also reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers.
2.6 COLORS
We have made every effort to display the colors of our products that appear on The New York Times Store website as accurately as possible. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
3. INTERNATIONAL PURCHASES
If you have purchased your product through our international vendor, these Terms of Sale may not apply to you. We are not liable to you for any claims related to purchases made through third parties. Please contact the third party
