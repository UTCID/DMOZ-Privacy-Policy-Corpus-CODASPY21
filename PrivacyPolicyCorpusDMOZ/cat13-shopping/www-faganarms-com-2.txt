Any item purchased from Fagan Arms may be returned for refund of the purchase price if you are not satisfied. The item must be returned fully insured within five days and in the same condition as sent. Items may be returned within ten days for credit. As the majority of sales are made immediately after a catalog is issued, we are unable to extend the terms for return in cases where the conditions of sale are not complied with. All purchases are deemed to take place exclusively in Clinton Township, Michigan and the date of return shall mean the date it is delivered in Clinton Township, Michigan. Refunds will be issued to the original purchase source, and may take 5-7 business days to process.
All orders are firm orders (non-cancellable).
