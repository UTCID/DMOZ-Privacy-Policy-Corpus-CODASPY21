Shipping Policy
Shipping Methods
USCF Sales proudly offers a variety of shipping methods from Fedex and the US Postal Service (USPS).Depending on the item/s being purchased and the delivery address, not all delivery options will be available to all customers. The rates quoted by our website reflect the actual shipping charge being quoted by that carrier for that particular method of delivery. In other words, that is what it will cost us to ship the package to the address that was provided. As such, we can not offer any shipping discounts beyond what is quoted on our website..
Fedex International Shipping
USCF Sales is proud to announce that our Fedex International Rates reflect a discount of upwards of 70% off the Fedex Standard International Shipping Rates. Fedex has graciously offered us a very generous discount package, and we in turn pass those shipping savings on to our customers.
Sales Tax
Only residents of the state of Alabama will be charged United States sales tax. If the address of delivery is outside the state of Alabama, you will NOT be charged any sales tax.
Returns and Exchanges
All Shipping Charges are non-refundable. In the event that you receive FREE SHIPPING on an item and then choose to return it for a refund, this will void the FREE SHIPPING and the actual shipping rate for the package will be deducted from any refund due.
Media Mail
USCF Sales proudly offers Media Mail shipping, a very cost-effective way to send DVDs, Books and Software via the US Postal Service. Please note that because the US Postal Service has significant restrictions on what can, and what can't be sent via Media Mail, we can only offer this option on orders where ALL of the items being ordered qualify as Media Mail. If you purchase even one item that does not qualify for Media Mail, such as a chess clock or a chess set, your order will not be Media Mail qualiified and the website will not offer it as a shipping option. We re sorry, but Media Mail is only available to customers living in  the United States.
FedEx Shipping Map
A shipping map is available below for estimated delivery time to your state via FedEx Home.
International Shipping
We are proud to ship to customers in many countries around the globe. All orders shipped internationally will be shipped via the method that you chose at the time of purchase. Please note that the arrival times listed on the U.S. web site apply to U.S. shipping addresses only. The
customs office of the
destination country may impose customs fees,
import duties, taxes, and
other charges to your international order
where applicable. These
additional charges required for customs
clearance are the responsibility
of the recipient. When your order
arrives at customs either our
shipper, or the customs office
will contact you directly to
arrange for the payment of any charges
that may be due.
