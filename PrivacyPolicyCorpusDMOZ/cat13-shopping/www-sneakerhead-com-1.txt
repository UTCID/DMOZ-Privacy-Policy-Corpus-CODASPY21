Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy only applies to Personal Data we collect when you visit, make a purchase from "Sneakerhead.com" or subscribe to a "Sneakerhead.com" email list, which refers to website (the "Site") https://www.sneakerhead.com, that is owned and operated by Sneakerhead.com. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection activities outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection).
By using the Site, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Site.
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us as set forth in section Contact Us below.
WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your IP address, device type, browser type, broad geographic location (for example, country or city-level location) and other technical information. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site.

Data storage and transfer
We use the Shopify platform to store, process and transfer your information collected through our Site. You can read more about Shopify's data privacy by visiting https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy. Your information is never transferred outside the United States.
Payment information

Keeping your information safe
We maintain physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Site. To protect the security of your information, we use industry standard secure authentication and encryption code and protocols to encrypt your information in transit and in storage. We use two-factor authentication for all server access in our production environment and we maintain industry standard system logging and monitoring. However, no security system is impenetrable. In the event any information under our control is compromised because of a security breach, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised.
Personal Data retention
We retain your Personal Data for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we may retain your information for longer periods as permitted or required by law, such as to maintain suppression lists, prevent abuse, if required in connection with a legal claim or proceeding, to enforce our agreements, for tax, accounting, or to comply with other legal obligations. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete or anonymize your information from our active databases.
