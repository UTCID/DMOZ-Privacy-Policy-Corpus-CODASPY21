Agreement to Resolve Disputes By Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, ARE MORE LIMITED.
Generally. Arbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, Company, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use (defined here), your relationship with Company, or these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase. This includes any and all claims or disputes that relate in any way to your use of the products, your attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Company or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products, as well as any claims relating to advertising or representations regarding the products. You, Company, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Company agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against Company. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration. This arbitration provision is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.
Exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement. As an exception to this arbitration agreement, you and Company both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. Company will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court. This arbitration agreement also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.
Waiver of Class and Representative Procedures. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other customers. Neither you nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other customers. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures. You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against Company, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely. You may send the written description by U.S. Mail to The Proactiv Company LLC, 100 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 1400, El Segundo, CA 90245; Attn: General Counsel. You agree to negotiate with Company in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after Company’s receipt of your written dispute, you may commence arbitration in accordance with this agreement.
Commencement of Arbitration. You and Company agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that, to the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.
Arbitration Location. For your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in a location within the federal district where you reside. It may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Company agree.
Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator. You agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim. The arbitrator shall be chosen from American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Rules and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the paragraph addressing the waiver of class and representative procedures are for the court to decide.
Arbitration Fees. Company shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.
Arbitration Award. The arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if applicable law allows it. Although Company may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Company agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. Any award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to limited appeal rights under the FAA.
Survival and Severability. This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Company, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. Except as provided otherwise in the "waiver of class and representative procedures" provision, if a portion of this arbitration provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.
Miscellaneous. Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Company and shall not be modified except in writing by Company.
Amendments. Company reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of the Company Website, purchase of a Company product, or use or attempted use of a Company product, is affirmation of your consent to such changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Company will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of any Company Website, purchase of a Company product, or use or attempted use of a Company product, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF A COMPANY PRODUCT (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO THE PROACTIV COMPANY LLC, 100 N. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, SUITE 1400, EL SEGUNDO, CA 90245; ATTN: GENERAL COUNSEL. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE IDENTIFYING ANY COMPANY PRODUCT YOU PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE WITHIN THE 30 DAYS AND THE DATE YOU FIRST PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE OF COMPANY PRODUCTS.

Remedies for Company
In order to avoid irreparable injury to Company, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement, we shall be entitled to seek an injunction and/or other equitable relief restraining such breach.
