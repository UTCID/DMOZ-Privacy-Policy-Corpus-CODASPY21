PRIVACY POLICY
CEIVA®, manufacturer of the world's first Digital Photo Frame™, cares about your privacy. The CEIVA website logs your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) and browser type, however we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable about you. Your session will be tracked, but your identity remains anonymous.
As a registered user, we ask that you provide us with your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, preferences and other types of demographic information. Demographic information helps us learn more about your product needs and concerns. Other personal information may be gathered on your order form for our product, which would include billing and mailing addresses, credit card or other financial data to make an electronic funds transfer to purchase our product.
If at the time you create/created your membership account you elect/elected to occasionally receive special offers from us, we will use your registration information to send you those special offers. Be assured that we never share information with any 3rd party marketing partners.
If you do not want us to use the information for marketing purposes, the information we ask for on our order form will only be used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for the product.
When you place your order online, your personal information and credit card information are encrypted or encoded. This makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred over the Internet. We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
PERSONAL INFORMATION — Safe and Secure
As a registered CEIVA user, all of your personal and energy data is transmitted using IETF RFC 6176 two way Transport Layer Security and is further encrypted using AES-128 encryption. When stored on CEIVA's US-based servers the energy data is separated from all location and personal account information by links that are encrypted using NIST 197 compliant encryption devices using AES-128 keys. All of the personal information collected as part of the registration process is transmitted via industry leading 256 bit SSL protocols and when stored on CEIVA's US-based servers it is encrypted using NIST 197 compliant encryption devices using AES-128 keys.
