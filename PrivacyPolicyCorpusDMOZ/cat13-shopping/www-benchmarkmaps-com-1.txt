An important message on road classifications and conditions:
We field check as many roads as we can when we build our atlas and map products, but it is impossible to drive them all.  There is no authoritative source for comprehensive, accurate road information.  Finally, all roads are subject to deterioration through lack of maintenance, and driveability can drop abruptly in bad weather conditions.  All roads, and especially backcountry roads, are potentially hazardous.  Benchmark Maps, LLC assumes no responsibility for the risks, dangers, and liability that may result from your use of this road atlas.
