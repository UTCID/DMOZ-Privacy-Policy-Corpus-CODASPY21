Delivery Time
We ship
within 24 hours of your order. Delivery time is normally 5 to 8 business days. Electronic (web) orders are the fastest way for us to process your order. Phone and mail orders take a little longer. We are currently fully stocked
and are delivering items within 5-8 days of the order being placed.
Out of Stock
In the instance an item is out-of-stock, you will be immediately notified as to an expected fulfillment date. If you wish, you will have the opportunity to cancel your order, and be credited in full.
No-Hassle Return Policy
After a decade plus of being in the business we know our products well and can accurately predict your satisfaction.
One note: if you haven't cut with a reel mower before, they are different and you need to follow the reel mowing rule of thumb to be a truly happy customer. The rule is cut 1/3 of the grass or less at each mowing. If you try to cut more, you will not love our machines. If you do cut 1/3, chances are you are going to be thrilled.
On most products the only risk you take is paying all shipping and handling costs and a 10% restocking fee. For the Recharge Electric Riding Mower the restocking fee is 25% due to its size and weight. We are that confident of our products!
How to Return
If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may send it back for a refund. You must call or email to arrange a return confirmation number before you ship the item.
Items must be returned in the original packaging in good condition to receive a refund. All returns must have your name and address, and your 5 digit order number. If you don’t have your 5 digit order number, we would need your date of purchase. A refund will be made within two weeks of receipt of the returned item. The refund will be in the amount of the retail price of the product, minus our actual shipping cost and a modest restocking fee. Restocking fees vary with the condition in which the product arrives back to us. If the product is in excellent condition, the restocking fee for most products is $10.00.
You will be notified via e-mail (if you’ve supplied one) of your refund once we have received the returned item. Please note that we do not refund shipping costs.
How to Order
Worried about using your credit card? Don’t be. We guarantee that every transaction you make on PPM will be 100% safe.
A word about shopping online:
Under federal law, a credit card issuer cannot make you liable for charges in excess of $50.00 that result from the unauthorized use of your credit card. There are similar federal laws that relate to debit cards. Exceptions do apply, and you will have to comply with the rules of your credit card or debit cared issuer, so please contact your card issuer for further details. Please visit the Federal Trade Commission’s web site
If you are new to on-line shopping or unfamiliar with our shopping environment, please refer to the following tutorial.
1
Add Item to Cart
Select an item you wish to buy and then click on the Add to Cart button which will transfer you to the shopping cart. The shopping cart will display the list of items you have selected to purchase.
And then Continue Shopping
To return to main shopping page, simply click on Continue Shopping.  Items will remain in your Cart while you are browsing or shopping further, and you can remove them or change their quantities at anytime.
2
View Cart
At any time, you can click the View Cart link to see or edit the list of items you have previously selected.
While viewing your shopping cart, you may wish to delete items from your list. To do this, select these items and click on Delete Line. Then, you can Recalculate to obtain your new total.
3
Ready to Buy
When you are ready to purchase the items in your shopping cart, click the Check Out link.
When your Credit Card is Charged
You will then be asked for payment, shipping, and e-mail information. Once you click the "Submit" button in the check-out process your credit card will be charged. We collect payment at the time the order is placed to ensure that your products are reserved and can be shipped immediately to you.
4
Order Confirmation
We will send you an email order confirmation moments after your order is processed.
Payment
Payment Accepted
All transactions are processed in U.S. dollars. We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and checks or money orders denominated in US dollars and drawn on a US bank. Please be sure to include the nine-digit routing number (ABA code) on the bottom of all checks.
Online Advantage
The average time to process an online order is slightly less than a phone order. This is because we receive the information —complete with your address and contact information - you sent us as soon as you made the purchase. Additionally, paying by check does slow your order down, as we don't ship merchandise until your funds clear. Within the US, paying by check typically delays your order about two weeks.
Security
We're Secure
Worried about using your credit card? Don't be. We guarantee that every transaction you make on peoplepoweredmachines.com will be 100% safe.

Our site uses 128-bit encryption and the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) security features provided by your Web browser. This ensures that your info is being encrypted in a way that meets or exceeds industry standards. You can rest assured that our site will not even allow you proceed to checkout unless your browser is able to operate in conjunction with our secure connection.
To verify whether your browser supports the level of security encryption in place on this site, click here.
