We may need to change this Policy from time to time in order to address new issues and to reflect changes on the Site or in the law. We reserve the right to revise or make any changes to this Policy, and your continual use of the Site subsequent to any changes to this Policy will mean that you accept such changes. Therefore, please bookmark this page and review it periodically to assure familiarity with the most current version of this Policy.

Information We Collect and Track
Boutique Jacques collects and retains two types of information about Site visitors: (i) personal information that individual visitors provide when interacting on the Site, or voluntarily provide on certain other occasions (such as via forms or in emails); and (ii) tracking data, which is automatically collected from every Site visitor and recorded on our log files, (collectively, "Information"). The Information that we gather may include your name, title and address, telephone number, email address, birth date and credit card number as well as other elements of personal information.
In addition, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your correspondence, including any Information contained therein.
You may decline to provide any personal information, but please realize that you thereby may be unable to register on the Site or to participate in activities or services offered by Boutique Jacques on the Site.
The tracking data we record includes, without limitation, information regarding the number and frequency of visits to the Site, the items you viewed and/or purchased, the websites that you access before and after you visit the Site, the software used to access the Site, and your IP address and Internet service provider related information. The tracking data we record may include the location of your computer.
How We Use Your Information
The Information that we collect and that you provide to us is used for our business purposes and the purpose for which you provided it, including, without limitation, to respond to your requests or correspondence. Boutique Jacques may also use the Information to contact you about the Site or to request your input regarding ways in which we might improve the Site. We may also use your Information to inform you about Boutique Jacques's activities, promotions, products, services and events in which Boutique Jacques thinks you may be interested. The Information may also be analyzed so that we can provide you with useful information and can serve you in the best manner possible through enhanced features and functions on the Site.
We will not disclose any personal information to third parties, except (i) to parties who perform a service for us, such as delivering orders or email, web hosting, credit card processing and other similar services; (ii) when we believe that such disclosure is required by law; (iii) to enforce this Policy or the Terms of Use; (iv) to protect the rights, property, security or safety of Boutique Jacques, Site users or the public; (v) to respond to an emergency; or (vi) as otherwise stated in this Policy. In addition, we may disclose Information to certain third parties if you have requested or authorized the disclosure of such Information.
We provide certain Information to third party service providers who perform specific functions on our behalf. For example, we may share your mailing address and other contact information with our delivery partners, and certain of our service providers (i.e., web hosting, credit card processing, catalog management and others) may have access to all or parts of the Information we maintain. All such Information provided to third parties is limited to the Information needed to perform their functions. We seek to limit third-party use of Information; however, we are not responsible for such third-party use of Information that is not in compliance with this Policy.

Use of Cookies
We use cookies to enhance your experience while using the Site. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies makes web surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords and your personal preferences in connection with your use of a particular website. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard. Your browser is probably set to accept cookies, but you are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some of the Services provided on the Site will not function properly.

Upon a Sale or Change of Control. We retain the right to transfer or assign all Information pursuant to a merger, sale, reorganization, purchase or other transaction relating to Boutique Jacques, its related companies or their assets if the assignee or purchaser agrees to abide by the terms of this Policy.
How Your Information Is Protected
We take reasonable precautions to protect your Information from loss, misuse or alteration. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards for your Information. You should recognize, however, that there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, and we cannot guarantee the security of your Information. In addition, because Internet communication is unsecure, it is also possible that the information you supply to us or your access of any information via the Site will be intercepted during transmission. We are not liable for any breach of our systems or interception of our transmission, and we hereby disclaim, to the fullest extent provided under law, any liability associated with any claim relating to a breach of security, data or information.

Such emails may be sent to users of the Site even if they have not requested to receive any communication from us.
Referrals
If a user elects to use our referral service to inform another person about the Site or Site features, we may request the name and email address of such other person. Boutique Jacques will automatically send a one-time email inviting such other person to visit the Site or to purchase items from Boutique Jacques. Boutique Jacques stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

This Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Quebec, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity that arises out of or relates to any use of the Site will be filed only in the provincial or federal courts located in Canada, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.
