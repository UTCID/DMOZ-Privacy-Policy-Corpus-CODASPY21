About Us
We’ve been in business for over 25 years. And we know what decorators and candy makers need because we’re decorators and candy makers ourselves.
In fact, our business started when avid baker Rita Brenenstuhl got frustrated that she couldn’t find the supplies she needed to make perfect wedding cakes.
Instead of crying into her cake, she opened the Confectionery House.
