Winter Automotive Essentials from Sears
When harsh winter conditions hit, you need to make sure your vehicle is equipped to run at peak performance. From winter tires to car batteries with high cold-cranking amps, Sears has everything you need to keep your car going throughout the cold winter months. You may also want a new set of winter car mats to protect against salt and road grime. Lastly, make sure you’re prepared for emergencies with a car emergency kit and jumper cables & vehicle battery chargers to keep you and your loved ones safe.
Snow Removal
Are you prepared for winter snow? Sears carries a full range of snow equipment from standard gas snowblowers to attachable snowblowers and blades for tractors that help you plow through deep snowdrifts and clear the driveway. We even carry electric snowblowers. If you’re looking for something a little more compact, check out our selection of snow shovels, roof rakes, and ice melt to keep snow and ice under control.
Winter Clothing & Footwear Essentials
Keep warm, cozy, and fashionable with trendy winter clothing and footwear from Sears this winter. We carry affordable men’s boots and women’s winter boots to keep your feet warm and dry this winter. We also carry a wide selection of men’s winter coats & jackets, and women’s winter coats & jackets to protect you from the harsh winter elements. Are your gloves wearing out? Don’t forget to browse our offering of men's gloves & mittens and women's gloves & mittens!
Heating & Winter Home Essentials
When cold weather arrives, it’s important you’re ready to stay cozy and comfortable at home. Keep your house warm and your electric bill low this winter with smart thermostats at Sears. With mobile capabilities, smart thermostats allow you to adjust your thermostat from anywhere and maximize energy efficiency without sacrificing comfort. We also carry space heaters, throw blankets, and electric fireplaces for alternate sources of home heating. Sometimes the most significant improvement you can make to keeping your home warm in the winter is by stopping drafts. Check out our door weather stripping and window insulation kits!

The holiday season is undoubtedly an exciting time of the year filled with special occasions and traditions for many people. Sears has a wide variety of Christmas items to brighten up your home this holiday season. Whether you’re looking for Christmas lights for your artificial Christmas tree, or classic Christmas ornaments, we have you covered! We also carry a selection of Christmas wreaths and Christmas inflatables to impress your neighbors! Don’t forget to stock up on wrapping paper and gift wrap; we have that too.

Make sure you have the tools to get your most important projects done right this year! From portable power tools to screwdrivers, Sears has the tools you need most at prices you can afford. We also have a great selection of shop vacuums to keep your workshop clean, and tool storage solutions to help you keep your wrenches, air tools, and mechanics tools organized and secure.
