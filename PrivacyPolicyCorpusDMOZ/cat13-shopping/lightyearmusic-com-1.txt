What if I don't want to give my credit card over the Internet?
Despite what you may have heard, paying by credit card over the Internet is safer than paying by credit card in a restaurant. Lightyearmusic.com uses secure technologies to keep your transaction safe. We use a secure server, which means that all information sent to us is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. This protects your information against disclosure to third parties. As added security, credit card information will never appear on any invoice sent to you nor do we store any credit cards - we will ask you for your credit information each time you purchase.
However, if you're still worried, you always place your order by phone by calling 1-800-557-7464 in the USA
