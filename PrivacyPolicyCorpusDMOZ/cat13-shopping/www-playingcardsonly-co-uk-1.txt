Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a Dispatch Confirmation Email to have been dispatched do not form part of that contract.
PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk reserves the right to cancel any order at our discretion. If we cancel an order, it will be without charge to you.

May we therefore suggest that if your order is of value or you wish to guarantee your delivery that you upgrade to our Royal Mail Recorded 'Signed For' option.
Royal Mail 2nd Class Post typically  takes 5-7 days whilst Royal Mail 1st Class service which can take 1-2 days. Please be aware that First Class deliveries are not guaranteed in the above time frames by the Royal Mail. For urgent orders you may want to consider opting for our NEXT DAY service.

Returns
At PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk we want you to be delighted every time you shop with us. Occasionally though, we know you may want to return items. That's why under our 30-day returns guarantee, if for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase, you can return it to us in its original condition within 30 days of the date you received the item.
By law, customers in the European Union also have the right to withdraw from the purchase of an item within seven working days of the day after the date the item is delivered. This applies to all of our products where the item has been unsealed.
To cancel your purchase within the seven-working-day cooling-off period, please package the relevant item(s) securely and send it to us so that we receive it within seven working days of the day after the date that the item was delivered to you.
Please note that we cannot accept returns if you deliver them to us by hand.
For your protection, we recommend that you use a recorded-delivery service if the value of the return is more than £20.
Please note that you will be responsible for the costs of returning the items to us unless we delivered the item to you in error, or if the item is damaged or defective. If we do not receive the item back from you with the delivery slip, we may arrange for collection of the item from your residence at your cost.
You should be aware that once we begin the delivery process you will not be able to cancel any contract you have with us for additional services carried out by us (eg: gift-wrapping).

For more information on your right to withdraw from your purchase within the seven working day cooling-off period, visit the Department of Trade and Industry's website at: http://www.dti.gov.uk/consumers/buying-selling/distance-selling/index.html.
Pricing and availability
We list availability information for products sold by us on the website, including on each product information page. Beyond what we say on that page or otherwise on the website, we cannot be more specific about availability. Please note that dispatch estimates are just that. They are not guaranteed dispatch times and should not be relied upon as such. As we process your order, we will inform you by email if any products you order turn out to be unavailable.
Items in your Shopping Basket will always reflect the most recent price displayed on the item's product detail page. Please note that this price may differ from the price shown for the item when you first placed it in your basket. Placing an item in your basket does not reserve the price shown at that time. It is also possible that an item's price may decrease between the time you place it in your basket and the time you purchase it.
Some discounts are limited-time offers. Also, as the discount we are able to offer for any item is dependent upon its availability, PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk's price will necessarily change on occasion.
We cannot confirm the price of an item until we receive your order; however, we do NOT charge your credit card until after your order has entered the dispatch process.
Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalogue are mispriced. Rest assured, however, that we verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. If an item's correct price is lower than our stated price, we charge the lower amount and send you the item. If a product's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will cancel your order and notify you of that cancellation.
PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk does not price-match with other retailers (including third-party sellers who sell their items on our website). We do, however, consistently work toward maintaining competitive prices on everything we carry.
We do not offer additional discounts on large orders of a single title or on large orders of many individual titles. Also, please note that any availability listings on our website are intended for single-copy orders.
Customs
When ordering goods from PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk for delivery overseas you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination. Any additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, please note that when ordering from PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods. We would like our international customers and customers dispatching products internationally to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.

For contractual purposes, you consent to receive communications from us electronically and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.
Losses
PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk will be responsible for any losses you suffer as a result of us breaching these conditions if the losses were reasonably foreseeable to both you and us when you commenced using the website, or a contract for the sale of goods by us to you was formed. We will not be responsible for any business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure) or any other indirect or consequential loss that is not reasonably foreseeable to both you and us when you commenced using the website or when a contract for the sale of goods by us to you was formed. PlayingCardsOnly.co.uk does not limit in any way our liability by law for death or personal injury caused from our negligence or breach of duty or caused by our gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
Alteration of Service or Amendments to the Conditions
We reserve the right to make changes to our website, policies, and these Conditions of Use & Sale at any time. You will be subject to the policies and Conditions of Conditions of Use & Sale in force at the time that you use the website or that you order goods from us, unless any change to those policies or these conditions is required to be made by law or government authority (in which case it will apply to orders previously placed by you). If any of these conditions is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
Events beyond our reasonable control
We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.
Waiver
If you breach these conditions and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these conditions.
Governing law and jurisdiction
These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, and the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree, as we do, to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
