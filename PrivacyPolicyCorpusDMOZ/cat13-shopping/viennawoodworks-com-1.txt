TERMS AND CONDITIONSTURN AROUND TIMEPlease note - OUR FURNITURE IS MADE TO ORDER. Delivery times are approximately 6-10 weeks from the time that you place an order. This is meant as a guideline, and can vary depending on the size of the order and the specific items that are ordered. We will do everything that we can to get your furniture sent to you as quickly as possible. At times, the wait for an order may be much shorter than 6-10 weeks and occasionally we go a bit longer than our guidelines. We are unable to accommodate orders with deadlines. If you ask us if we can have an order done by a specific date, we will attempt to accommodate you but we can not guarantee that we will have the order done on a specific date. Our furniture is all hand made and is made from solid wood one piece at a time. Because it is made to order, once the order is placed, your order is put into our order file, or, in a sense, you are getting in line behind the rest of the orders that are in the file at that time. Once your order is placed, please feel free to call us and ask the status, however we often don't have a status available for a few weeks after the order date. When your furniture is ready to be shipped, our shipping company will notify you so that you can make arrangements to be available for the delivery. More about our furniturePrices are subject to change without notice.

The items on our website catalog are representative of our furniture, however, each piece is custom made and will vary slightly from the samples pictured due to the natural characteristics of the logs.Our Rustic Log Furniture is made with northern white cedar. Northern white cedar is very strong despite its characteristic checking and cracking. This is part of the rustic look, and is not a defect in your piece of furniture. Despite some cracking in the logs, they remain extremely sturdy.There is a slight color variation in northern white cedar. Northern white cedar also has knots, and other natural markings made from beetles or other insects made during the time the log was a tree in the forest. We use mortise and tenon construction, which is an age old method and still the strongest furniture joint possible.
Glue is applied to ensure that the furniture joint will be sturdy and durable.
We hand peel and buff all of our logs to bring out the natural color of the wood. For those who want a truly rustic look, we leave the knots in place as they occur naturally on the logs. Our Reclaimed Barnwood Furniture is made from authentic 75-100 year old barnwood.
There is a color variations in all barnwood. The barnwood has knots, character and saw marks in the wood.
The wood may will also have marks from dismantling the barn.
Nail holes and cracks will be visible and will not affect the structure and durability of the product, that is what gives the piece of furniture it character and uniqueness of one of a kind furniture.
