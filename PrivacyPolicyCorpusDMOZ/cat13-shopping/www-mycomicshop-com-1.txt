Privacy and Security
mycomicshop.com is committed to providing a secure web site that respects and protects your privacy. This page summarizes our privacy and security policies. We also provide a complete P3P-compliant policy file and a human-readable version of that policy file.
Cookies
We use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and your login. If your browser is not accepting cookies from our site, you will be unable to shop because your shopping cart will appear to be empty each time you try to put something in it. Without cookies, our site has no way to identify you from one page to the next.
Email Address
We require an email address to place an order. This email address is used only to contact you with information about the status of your order. We will never send you advertisements or other unrequested email. We will never, ever give your email address to a spammer or any third party. If you need to update the email address registered at our site, please email service@mycomicshop.com
Mailing List
We send out a weekly email to members of our Preferred Customer mailing list (the sign up form for the mailing list is located on our home page). The only way to get on the mailing list is if you specifically request to be put on it (opt-in) and then confirm your subscription. When you request to join the mailing list, a confirmation email is sent to your email address. The email contains a confirmation link that must be clicked to confirm your subscription. This prevents someone from fraudulenty signing up using someone else's email address and guarantees that the mailing list is never sent to someone who has not requested to receive it.
Every email sent out by the mailing list includes a link to unsubscribe at the bottom of the email. You can also unsubscribe at any time by emailing service@mycomicshop.com.
Other Contact Information
The name and address that you supply when placing an order is used only for the processing of your order. Your contact information will never be distributed to any third parties or used for any purposes but the processing of your transaction. Your contact information is saved in our database so that you won't have to re-enter it each time you place an order, but we will delete your contact information at your request (email service@mycomicshop.com)
Credit Cards and Payment Information
When you're ordering, we give you the option of saving your credit card information for reuse on future orders.
If you choose not to save your information, we retain your payment information for only as long as it is necessary to charge your card. Your information is automatically cleared as soon as it is no longer needed.
If you choose to allow us to reuse your credit card information, your information will be held for up to six months, after which it will be automatically cleared. You must re-enter all your credit card information any time you're shipping to an address that you have not used before. This ensures that even if somebody guessed your password, they could not use your credit card to place an order for themselves. Furthermore, we require that the 3 or 4 digit card verification code be entered with every credit card order, even for those customers who have chosen to store their payment information for reuse. This provides an extra layer of security while still allowing you the convenience of not having to type a 16 digit number every time you order.
