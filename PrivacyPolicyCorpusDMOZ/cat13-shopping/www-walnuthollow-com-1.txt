It may be the fine print written by our lawyer, but it's still important.  We're dedicated to protecting your privacy.
Walnut Hollow Farm, Inc. ("Walnut Hollow," "we," "us”) respects your privacy, including the privacy of your information his Privacy Policy explains what information we collect through our website at www.walnuthollow.com (the "Site") and our other Services, and how we use this information to provide outstanding service to you.
By accessing and using the Site or other Services owned and/or operated by Walnut Hollow (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services.
If you feel that Walnut Hollow is not abiding by this Privacy Policy, you should contact us. Walnut Hollow's offices are located at 1409 State Road 23, Dodgeville WI 53533. We will do our best to resolve your inquiry.
This policy was last updated: 05/30/12
1. Information Collected Through Our Services
We gather two basic types of information through the Services: personally identifiable information that identifies a person as an individual ("Personal Information") and non-personally identifiable information, which includes aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal a person's specific identity ("Non-Personal Information").
a. Personal Information - You do not have to provide Personal Information to use the Site. However, you may need to provide certain Personal Information to use some of our other Services. For example, when you sign up with Walnut Hollow, you establish a password-protected personal account for using our other Services. In order to establish your Walnut Hollow account, we will need your name, email address and password. (The password will allow you access to your account; as such, it needs to be as secure as possible. A good password includes seemingly random letters and numbers, and isn't obvious (as an example, we do not suggest using names of a spouse, child, or pet). Additionally, when you order products or other paid products or services, we will need the shipping address, billing name and address, as well as the credit card number and expiration date (processed and authorized through Authorize.Net).
b. Non-Personal Information - When you visit and interact with the Services, we and our service providers and business partners may collect Non-Personal Information from sources such as server log files, environmental variables (such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version) and from scanning navigational data to collect Non-Personal Information about our users in order to help us deliver better service and user experience. Such Non-Personal Information could include the web site you were on before coming to Walnut Hollow, IP addresses, or areas of site being clicked on most frequently. We and our service providers (including ad servers, outbound email vendors, affiliate vendors and search engine advertising agencies, and providers of web analytics tools) and business partners may also use "cookies" as well as so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" and other similar technologies to help us deliver better service and user experience and to facilitate your ongoing access to and use of our Services. Cookies are small data files stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may not be able to access the Services.
2. How We Use the Information We Collect
a. Personal Information - We may use Personal Information in the following ways:
i. Fulfillment of Requests - We may use Personal Information to fulfill the purpose for which such Personal Information was provided (e.g., to fulfill your purchase or other transaction).
ii. Administrative Communications - From time to time, we may send you service announcement updates with important information about Walnut Hollow. Service announcements may contain information vital to your account, so members may not unsubscribe from service announcements.
iii. Other Communications - We may notify you via email or through the mail about new features, products and promotions. We may also send you information on carefully screened third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe from these mailings, please review the instructions in the Section 6 ("Opt-Out") below.
iv. Contests and Surveys - We may occasionally request Personal Information through surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. The Personal Information collected is only used for purposes of improving user satisfaction with Walnut Hollow products and services, or in some cases, to notify winners and to deliver prizes. No Personal Information collected through these means is shared with or available to other third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes.
v. Testimonials - Testimonials are used to show benefits to certain programs Walnut Hollow offers. Walnut Hollow always seeks consent prior to posting any testimonial in which Personal Information is included.
vi. Customer Service - Any Personal Information obtained through your contact with our Customer Service team or communications with us, such as chat or emails, may be recorded to help us provide better service.

For example, we may recommend products or offers you may be interested in based on what you have liked in the past, or remind you that you have an "active" shopping cart waiting for you. Additionally, in order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.
b. Non-Personal Information - Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share Non-Personal Information, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographic location).
