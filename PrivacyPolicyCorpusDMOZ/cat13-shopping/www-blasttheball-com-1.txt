Our Privacy and Ethics Statement – The best and shortest one you’ll ever read.
We HATE… websites that spam you once you sign up, or send you endless emails. We will NEVER send you an email other than our annual update email.  You may also get an email reminding you your membership is about to expire if you view online.
–
We NEVER sell or share you email or information with anyone. Period.
–
NONE of your personal or payment information is ever stored on our website, servers, or our system.  The only thing our systems keep is your email address and the password you use to signup to access the videos.  If the world’s greatest hacker was to break in… all they would be able to do is watch videos for free.  Hope they have kids playing soccer.
–
There’s not a whole lot more to say… having ETHICS… makes all the difference.
