OurNameIsMud.com acknowledges the EU’s standard for personal data protection. OurNameIsMud.com has a need to extract and compile the personal data of employees and customers in the EU. This Policy addresses the privacy concerns of European employees and customers and the business concerns of the company.
We are providing you with this Policy to inform you of the kinds of information we may gather during your visit to OurNameIsMud.com; why we gather customer information; what we use the information for; under what circumstances we may disclose such information; and how you can instruct us to limit the use of that information. We may update our Policy from time to time, so you should review it periodically.
By using our Site you consent to the collection and use of information by us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. If we decide to change our Policy, we will post those changes on our Site and applications and notify you either by email, with a notification on OurNameIsMud.com, or by other means, consistent with applicable law. By continuing to use our Site after notice is given, you will have consented to our use of your information in this different manner.
This Policy does not apply to personal information collected from you offline or to third party web sites to which our Site may link. Your use of our Site is subject to this Policy. Please read this Policy before using our Site or providing personal information to us.
Note: You must be 18 years old or older to use our services.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
When you place an order on our Site, we require you to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”). This information provides us the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact or locate you. PII may consist of: your name, address, telephone number, email address, birth date, billing information, occasion type (Valentine's Day, etc.), products purchased, any relevant promotion code, and information and the recipient's name, address, telephone number, email address, and any other information you may provide us. We use PII for internal purposes, such as processing and fulfilling your order, confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and developing new products and services. PII is compiled by us and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.
We may retain e-mail or other communications you send to us in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services. To protect your privacy, you should not provide us with any information that is not specifically requested.
Our Site may collect information about your visit without you actively submitting such information. This information may include, for example, your browser type and language, your operating system, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the URLs of sites you visited before and after visiting our Site, the web search that landed you on our Site, and web pages and advertisements you view, and links you click on within our Site. This information may be collected using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags, and web beacons. Your Internet browser also automatically transmits to our Site some of this information, such as the URL of the website you just visited and the browser version your computer is operating. To protect against fraud and other misconduct, we may collect information about your interaction with our Site, which may contain account identifying information which only OurNameIsMud.com can decode.
When you provide information, including PII, to one of our brands, we may share that information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with any OurNameIsMud.com brands. In addition, these brands may send you offers and promotions about their products and services. We will also share information, including PII, when consumers direct OurNameIsMud.com to share the information with third-party sites including, but not limited to social networking sites.
We may contract with third parties to provide services including, but not limited to, credit card processing, distribution, data management, etc. We may also ask third parties to fulfill your order. We only provide these third parties with the information needed for them to complete these services. We also ask third parties to confirm their security and privacy policies are consistent with ours, and do not authorize them to make any other use or disclosure of your information. However, please note that once we share your personal information with another company, the information received by the other company is controlled by that company and becomes subject to the other company’s privacy practices.
We may also use information, including PII, to communicate with you about your account or transactions and send information or request feedback from consumers regarding your website and changes to our policies; send offers and promotions of products or third-party products (including of other companies that are owned by OurNameIsMud.com); personalize content; provide consumers with targeted advertising based on your activity on our sites and applications and on third-party sites and applications; operate, understand, optimize, develop, or improve company’s sites, products, and operations, including by using guest survey research and analytics tools; and detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate the company’s policies or be illegal.
OurNameIsMud.com may disclose information, including PII, if necessary, in our good faith judgment, to respond to information requests from government authorities, to address national security situations, or when otherwise required by law. We may also disclose such information when OurNameIsMud.com reasonably believes that it is needed to identify, contact or bring legal action against a party who may be causing injury to or interference with OurNameIsMud.com’s rights or property, registered customers or potential customers of OurNameIsMud.com, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
In the event of a sale or merger of OurNameIsMud.com or any of our businesses, our customers’ information, including PII and any other information we have collected as described in this Policy may be among the transferred business assets.
When you place an order, we will establish your own personal account where PII used in placing such order is saved. Your personal account is password protected from all third parties. You may access your personal account by requesting your password from us (go to My Account) and then signing in with that password. Afterwards, you may change your password, edit your PII, or request a password reminder at any time. Our database may store your billing and delivery information and will automatically transfer it to the order form each time you place an order so that you do not have to re-enter this information when you sign in at subsequent visits.
Within your personal account settings, you may opt in for our additional services. We may use your contact information so that you receive the full benefit of these services. You may view, edit, or opt out of these services at any time.
