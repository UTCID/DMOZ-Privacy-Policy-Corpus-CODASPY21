Testimonials
"I have chosen/ ordered/ had delivered 7 gift baskets over the last 13 months and I have to say: the recipients of the baskets LOVED the items as well as the overall presentation and delivery. I had orders sent to North Vancouver, Kamloops, Langley, Surrey, and even Brampton, Ontario: 2 of the 7 were crying so hard they couldn’t properly thank me and state what they loved about the gift. So thank you very much for keeping your baskets both beautiful and professional."
Christine A, Langley, Canada
"Thank you for the beautiful Rosh Hashanah gift box.
I have never seen anything like it before.  We have been enjoying the apples and honey this week."
David P., Vancouver, Canada
"I am very pleased and pleasantly surprised to hear that my sister-in-law received her gift sooner than I expected.  She texted me right away and told me she had tears of joy.  Her family was impressed with the basket presentation as well.
Again, I am deeply thankful for your thoughtfulness, attention to detail and kindness of going out of your way to expedite delivery. The family is going through a difficult time right now and I am very blessed to have picked the right business to help me lift their spirits.
Michelle F., Seattle, USA
