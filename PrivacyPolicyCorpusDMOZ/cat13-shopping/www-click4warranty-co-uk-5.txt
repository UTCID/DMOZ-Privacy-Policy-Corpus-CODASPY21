Terms & Conditions
Are All Warranty Terms Insured?
Most buyers incorrecty assume all Warranties are Insured.  While Click4Warranty policies are Insured and protected by the FSCS, there are now websites selling "discretionary" plans with no insurance safeguards.Make an informed decision.
I’m protected by Insurance regulations, aren’t I? Click4Warranty provide Insured Warranties, this is a Regulated Financial Service and we are a motor related Insurance Company authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority! The FCA say, if there's discretion as to whether any benefit is provided, it IS NOT a contract of insurance
If a part is listed, it is covered, isn’t it? Click4Warranty policies are a contract of Insurance, case law explicitly establishes the obligation is enforceable and the provider DOES NOT have freedom to decline valid claims. ! Discretionary plans have the freedom to decide if any benefit is provided
There will be enough money to pay my claim… won’t there? Click4Warranty underwriters are required to prove there are adequate funds set aside to pay claims (Insurance Fund).  The group currently has assetts in excess of £77m. Policies are protected by the UK’s statutory compensation scheme for customers of authorised financial services firms, the FSCS. ! Sellers of discretionary plans aren’t required to hold enough money to pay claims, potentially leaving buyers exposed to repair costs.
If I’m not happy the Financial Ombudsman will help me... won’t they?Click4Warranty policy holders have the support of the statutory powers of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to settle disputes, their decisions are legally binding! Discretionary plans are not underwritten by an insurance company, buyers do not have the support of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).
