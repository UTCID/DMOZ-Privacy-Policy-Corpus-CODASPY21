Privacy Policy
This site is maintained and operated by TIAS.COM, Inc.
('TIAS'). TIAS.com is now the largest "fixed price" source of antiques and
collectibles on the Internet, serving over 120 million page views per
month. We host approximately 1,000 online antique
and collectible merchants and offer a variety of services for collectors and
hobbyists -- among them free virtual antique cards, free newsletters, low-cost
classified ads and discussion groups.
On some TIAS web pages, you can make requests, purchase
products or ask to receive materials. On these pages, we collect your name
and contact information. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you
and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to
voluntarily provide us with information regarding yourself, your
experience with our products and services, and your contact preferences.
TIAS is committed to respecting your privacy.  Once you
choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information
by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be
used to support your customer relationship with TIAS and our merchants.
This statement regarding the privacy of the information
you provide online covers five main areas: Awareness,
Choice, Access & Accuracy,
Security, and Oversight.
Awareness
TIAS provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our
privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way
your information is collected and used.
How we use it
TIAS uses your information to better understand your needs and to
provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to
help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you
on services, products and benefits, and to personalize our web site for
you.
From time to time, we may also use your information to
contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing
information we think would be of particular interest.
Who we share it with
TIAS will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable
information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by
law, we will only share the data you provide online with other TIAS
entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to complete
the activities described above. Such TIAS entities and/or business
partners, including those located in other countries, are governed by our
privacy policies with respect to the use of this data. To grant or deny
permission to share your information with others, click here (this feature allows you to review
all mailing lists on our site and remove yourself if you wish) or contact postmaster@tias.com
Choice
TIAS will not use or share the personally identifiable information
provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above
without letting you know and offering you a choice.
If you wish to have your personally identifiable
information removed from our system, you can do so by clicking here or by contacting us at postmaster@tias.com and asking to
be removed from our mailing list.
If you received a mailing from us, (a) your email
address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this
address for the purpose of receiving information in the future
("opt-in"), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise
have an existing relationship with us. We respect your time and attention
by controlling the frequency of our mailings.
Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease
receiving email from us, or to change your expressed interests. If you
wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email.
If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system
or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that
email with your comments to abuse@tias.com
for review.
Access & Accuracy
TIAS strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate.
If you wish to correct your information, you may correct it yourself by clicking here or by contacting us at postmaster@tias.com
with corrected information.
You can review and change your current mailing lists
and personal information at any time by clicking here.
TIAS is committed to honoring your intellectual property rights.
If
you believe that these rights have been violated by any TIAS merchant, please contact
us at privacy@tias.com
and provide the details of the infringement.
Security
TIAS is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent
unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate
use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
collect online. Read about why your order
data is secure at TIAS.
While you are shopping at TIAS, we may place a temporary cookie on your
computer system.    We use the cookie for two purposes: to
keep track of the number of users accessing our site and for keeping track
of your shopping carts.   The only time we use cookies to
correlate with names is to tie the items ordered to the name of the person
doing the ordering in our shopping cart application. Cookies are the most
reliable and easiest to implement way of doing this.  We do not share
our cookies with other sites, nor do we use cookies from other sites and
when you close your browser, the TIAS cookie will automatically be
deleted.  Click here for a full
explanation of our cookie processing.
