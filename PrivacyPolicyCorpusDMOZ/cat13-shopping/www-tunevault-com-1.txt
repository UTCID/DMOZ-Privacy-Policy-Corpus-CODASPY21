Privacy
Hey, we're normal guys. We treat you, the customer, with
the utmost respect. The same way we would like to be treated. We don't
like SPAM or junk mail.
When you sign up for our mailing list, you will be asked
a bunch of questions. Rest assured they are all optional. If you answer
any or all of them, it may help us improve our site and services, and
tell us a little something about the people who are using the site. If
you don't answer any, we won't cry. It's your choice.
Some day someone might ask us to pass on an offer to
you. If we think it's relevant and useful to our subscribers we may do
so. But we will not give out your email address or any other information
to any third party without your permission. That's the kind of guys we
are. Feel free to send us any comments or suggestions by clicking
here.
Thanks.
The
TuneVault Team.
