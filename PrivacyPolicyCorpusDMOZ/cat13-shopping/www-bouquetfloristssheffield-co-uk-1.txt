Privacy Policy
Bouquet Florist are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 & subsequent revisions thereof). We collect information about you for two reasons: to process your order and to provide you with the best possible service.
We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your consent (except to confirm orders).
We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing e-mail from us or from any other third party companies in the future.
The type of information we will collect about you includes:
your name

phone number
e-mail address
We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.
The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. It is possible to obtain a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly. Should you require a copy of such information, please write to us at:

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and English law.
We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening (for example, using Internet Explorer select 'internet options' from the 'tools' menu, then click 'security', followed by 'custom level' and select 'disable cookies').
The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings.
Cookies are also used as a further means of ensuring private and secure purchase sessions are operated within the site.
Every time you connect to our website we store a log of your visit which shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the internet (IP address). This tells us what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not and which browser you use to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes only. This helps us to understand which areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting the website in total.
Data collected will not be shared with any other companies.
We may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by email or an announcement on the website.
If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should email us.
