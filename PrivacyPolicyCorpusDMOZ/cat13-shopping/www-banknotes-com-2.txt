Has my order shipped?

mailing status please login to your account. If you did not
receive our shipping confirmation via email most likely
it ended up in your "spam" folder.

5 business days.
There are major international delivery delays due to flight cancellations and government restrictions.
Choose FedEx for faster deliveries of your orders! Intertnational Service Disruptions (Service Alerts, USPS.COM)

and a telephone number of the
recipient. Not providing either one along with your order
may cause order processing and shipping delays (until the
abovementioned data is provided to us).

How do I track shipment of my order?
COVID-19 Notice:
There may be significant mail and courier delivery delays to a number of countries right now due to a
lack of available transport links and suspension of
certain countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it faster, select FedEx delivery instead.
You can track your order shipment (if tracking number is
provided) by going to, for example: Global Track & Trace or www.royalmail.com or www.usps.com or www.auspost.com.au or www.ctt.pt or www.epg.ae or www.fedex.com (FedEx tracking is currently
malfunctioning) or for EMS Insured: http://www.ems.post/tracking or another country's postal
service website (depending which service you are using
and where you live) or by logging into your account at Banknotes.com international store. Please note that
Registered Mail is not (fully) trackable (especially to the USA) even on a mail carrier's website and may
be only trackable or rather traceable by submitting a
written application or paying a visit to a post office
and then waiting up to 3 months for the postal authority
statement regarding delivery of the mail piece.
Naturally: Air Mail, First Class, Surface mail do not
have any tracking, tracing or insurance and is mailed
only at Customer's (Recipient's) own risk. If desired
purchase shipping insurance here or here.
Please
note that BASIC MAIL (also known as: AIR MAIL, REGULAR
MAIL, SIMPLE MAIL, FIRST CLASS MAIL, ORDINARY POST,
STAMPED MAIL, NORMAL MAIL, ECONOMY MAIL) is sent at
buyer's own risk since it does not bear any insurance nor
a tracking number. If in doubt, and needing some
protection and/or a tracking number, please select
Registered Mail (partial tracking only (to North America)
with an indemnity limit of $45) or Priority Air Mail
(fully trackable but uninsured, thus unprotected)
shipping method instead. If desired purchase shipping insurance here or here.
U.S. customers only (USPS information):

My order has not arrived yet
COVID-19 Notice:
There may be significant mail and courier delivery delays to a number of countries right now due to a
lack of available transport links and suspension of
certain countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it faster, select FedEx delivery instead.
Please allow at least a couple weeks for your order to
arrive to bigger cities and longer to more remote
locations around the world. Expect your order to take up
to 1 or even up to 2 months (usually less) in some rare
cases for orders to arrive via Registered Mail or via
regular mail. If it's been more than 2 months since your
order was shipped out to you, then please email us with
your order number, your name, your email or mailing
address and we will track and trace the shipment to see
what happened to it. The details given on delivery time
periods are not binding.
If your Registered Mail order shipment is declared
lost/stolen (after a 90 day long postal REGISTERED MAIL
investigation) and if it was fully insured (upon request
during order placement process or if extra insurance was
purchased by the customer) then we will re-ship your
order again as soon as the postal authority responds and
declares the shipment as lost.
We will not be held responsible for delivery of any mail
to any redirect or trans-shipment address that we are not
aware of and are not informed about in advance (during
the order placement).
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please note that if you selected
Registered Mail shipping method you will have to pick the
shipment up at your local post office unless it decides
to deliver to your door and find you at the right time at
your residence, work or business. Otherwise as in most
cases please expect a mail delivery notice left in your
mail box. Look out for it. Please pick it up promptly
since many post offices only hold registered mail for up
to a week and then return it to the sender if it is not
picked up within 6-7 days! You will usually have to pay a
reshipment fee (in most cases).
If you wish to find out how long it takes for mail to
reach a recipient (for your order to reach you) please
contact your local post office or visit an appropriate
mail carrier/courier web site. Please allow more time for
mail delivery delays, customs delays, holidays and so on
and your patience is truly apppreciated.
Please note that REGISTERED AIR MAIL may sometimes take
up to TWO (2) or more months to arrive (longer during
emergency situations and political drills). It usually
takes much less time, on average about 2-3 weeks, but
accordingly to Post Office and International Postal
Convention laws a Registered mail sender can only make a
request to search for a delayed registered mail AFTER
(not earlier) it's been 1 month. Better if it's two to
three months.
We now have numerous reports from the U.S. recipients so
far, that the Registered Mail mailed to them from Europe was
found in their regular mail boxes, without obtaining
recipient's signature. This practice has now been
extended to most Registered Mail worldwide (during
COVID-19 emergency).
(30 days) after the mail was sent. Sometimes 2-3 months.
Please be patient in case of delay and try not to load us
with extra unnecessary inquiries if it's been less than
30 days since your Registered letter (package) was
shipped out to you. If you wish to receive your order
FAST then please rather select a speed courier delivery
such as FedEx (although FedEx tracking system appears to
be broken and their service has seen better days). There
is also so-called "Express Mail Service" (EMS)
which we have discontinued providing on our website,
because the EMS can sometimes be really slow as it is and
since they partner their deliveries with DHL they open
and confiscate packages with our hobby collectables on
pretenses of "not allowed or prohibited items".
Therefore
we no longer provide EMS delivery with insurance or EMS delivery at
all (unless requested and shipped upon your own risk of
significant delays, sometimes lasting for several months
due to stubborn behaviour of the EMS). The details given on
delivery time periods are not binding. We
are not responsible for actions of your country's postal
service and their employees or partners. We are also not
responsible if your mail is misdelivered, not delivered
or returned to the sender due to the incomplete address
provided to us by you in your order at Banknotes.com.
Your address must be 100% correct and consistent
throughout all places you provided it us with. Reshipment
to a corrected address at your fault may cost you another
shipping and handling (S&H) charge.
Your order is considered delivered once it crosses your
country's border (arrives at Customs or ISC -
international sorting center of your country). We are
unable to control the country's of destination postal
service or politics. While we (I) fully cooperate in
tracking and helping to find the delayed or missing mail
piece, we (I) do not have the magical powers to find out
the whereabouts of your mail if the postal authorities
(postal service) do not provide tracking or insurance for your order's
shipment and if the destination's postal service does not
cooperate. Customer must decide and select the safest
mailing (shipping) method for their order or ask us for
advice and Customer must purchase (extra) insurance if
Customer sees necessary and to have their order fully
insured. Uninsured and under-insured orders are sent at
Customer's own risk. Please note that default mailing
services such as Air Mail, First Class, Sea Mail, Ground
Mail, Surface Mail, Normal Mail, Basic Mail do not
provide tracking neither any insurance and are only sent
at Customer's own risk. Your business, your patience and
your understanding is truly apppreciated.
Maximum indemnity for international registered
mail is ~$45.
NOTICE: All shipments of all kinds of valuables, be that
a general or a registered mail shipment (above the $45
indemnity coverage), are being sent at the buyer's risk
unless the buyer purchases shipping insurance for the item(s) they are ordering
or selects a shipping method with insurance (where
available and if purchased), or selects FedEx delivery.
Please note that FedEx only insures the
contents for up to $100. On the other hand, we have not had a single loss with
FedEx in 25 years, despite their service and tracking
system has seen better days, better attitudes and better
speeds.
By placing an order with Banknotes.com and prepaying for
it with a credit card (or Paypal) you the Customer are
fully responsible to select the correct and the safest
shipping method for your order transaction and if you see
it necessary to pay for the (extra) insurance for your
ordered goods. In case of a loss of the ordered
merchandise shipment where the shipping method indicates
"Shipping at your own risk" or where insurance
was not requested and paid for by the Customer, the
Customer is going to be held responsible for the lost
merchandise and the action to order and thus to withdraw
the merchandise from our store and ship it to the
Customer at Customer's full responsibility.
In other words; when you place your order with us, you
are requesting us to help you mail specific items to you
and on your behalf using the shipping method that you
find best suitable and safe and are paying for it, you
become the owner and a fully responsible party of the
merchandise as soon as we mail it to you from a post
office (or FedEx) and provide you with a mailing date
(First Class, Air Mail) or with a tracking (Priority Air
Mail) or registration (Registered Mail) number. From that
point if problems occur with the shipment we as a Sender
will, upon your request, make postal (or speed courier)
inquiries (and submit Postal Investigation Requests, by
filling out specific Investigation Forms and submitting
them to the local Postal Authority) for your property if
it was mailed by Registered Mail or via FedEx only.
Shipments sent via Air Mail or Priority Air Mail can not
be tracked nor recovered and are sent absolutely at the
Customer's own risk (except when Customer purchases extra
private insurance from our store).
REQUEST: Please let us know when your order arrives and
whether you like and enjoy the items you received. We care about your orders ands our
hobby in general and would be great to hear from you
about how you are doing and how we can further improve our service and have consumers
become more involved in helping improving Postal and
Courier Services around the world. Your feedback is welcome.

How do I create an account?
Accounts are usually
created when you make a purchase. We recommend you use
the same email address and the
same username each time you place an order with us. Avoid
creating two or more usernames,

placing
your order or even
logging in. Therefore always
try to recover your original username and password instead of dumping those and creating a new
one. Contact us and we will help you to
recover your old username. Finally if
all else, just create a new username or account and ask us to delete any
old accounts of yours, that
is, if you don't need to view your old order history. To sign-up (register; create an

How well is my merchandise protected
during shipping?
We handle
all the banknotes very carefully either with cotton
gloves or with very clean and dry hands. All your ordered banknotes are carefully
selected, inspected for quality and then are carefully
placed into clear plastic acid-free
special currency envelopes - holders, usually up to about
25-30 banknotes per envelope or sleeve (currency holder). Then each
currency holder with banknotes (or with other paper or
plastic products) in it is carefully wrapped into a clean
sheet of paper, which is
sealed and folded at the ends where the currency holder
has openings. This is done to make sure that not a single banknote slips
out and gets damaged (folded, bent, creased) during
shipping and that the currency sleeve is preserved intact from contact with
a sticky tape. Then each paper envelope (containing
currency holder with banknotes in it) is placed on a sturdy piece of a
cardboard or a stiffener and is taped to it. All of this
is placed into an envelope along with your order
invoice, sealed, glued, stamped and is shipped to you.
Note: If you wish to give us your instructions on how you
would like to have your order packed, please add a
specific note to your order about that.

The packaging of my order looks like
it's been tampered with
If the packaging of your
order that you just been handed to be signed for in the
post office or at your doorstep looks like it has been
tampered with and the contents were possibly damaged,
opened, resealed, etc. you should carefully open the
package in front of a postal employee, or even better if
in front of a Postmaster with at least one other witness
(one of them a postal employee or a Postmaster) and
inspect everything for damage etc. If the envelope or the
packaging has been apparently opened by Customs and
resealed providing a sticker, a seal, a time of opening,
a signature of the Customs or of the postal employee and
a reason of opening, please scan or photograph everything
on the outside and email us the photos. You must inspect
the contents in front of a postal clerk or a Postmaster
without leaving the premises of the Post Office. Submit
report to your post office and make sure they sign for
it, accept it and also provide you with a copy of the
report. That is, if you wish to claim damages. In some
cases if the packaging looks like it's been badly
damaged, without leaving the post office have the post
office safely pack it and return it to us at the post
office's expense only. If this happens at your door step,
record everything and hand it back to the postal delivery
person for a return at the postal system's expense only.
Do not pay the post office for the return postage and do
not do this in the privacy of your home or by leaving the
post office and make sure at least one postal employee
and one witness is watching or even better - filming what
you are doing.
If you receive your order and after opening it everything
seems in good shape and in place, but the package seems
to have been opened and resealed by the Customs, by the
Postal system or by Unknown, please document and
photograph (scan) everything and email us the photos for
future reference and we appreciate that.

What are my shipping charges?
COVID-19 Notice:
There may be significant mail and courier delivery delays to a number of countries right now due to a
lack of available transport links and suspension of
certain countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it faster, select FedEx delivery instead.
Shipping varies by product price, weight, delivery location
and delivery method. We recommend that you add the items you wish to purchase into
your shopping cart. Within the shopping cart page you
will be asked to enter in your
postal or zip code (ZIP = US Customers Only). If you live
outside of the USA, then do not enter anything into the zip
code field. Shipping costs should then be displayed. You may have to press the 'recalculate'
button. For shipping
costs when paying with a non-credit card method please
see the following page: "Shipping Options".
Currently available shipping options are the following: (the
details given on delivery time periods are not binding)
ORDINARY UNINSURED BASIC
AIR MAIL
- Shipping on the recipient's own risk and only for
orders in small or limited amounts. Signature is not
required, is not requested and such functionality is not
available. It carries no insurance and, naturally, no
tracking is available. If desired, purchase shipping
insurance here or here. You as the Customer who places the order
is fully responsible for the delivery of your order using
such a mailing method beyond the the post office of
origin. NOTE: it is possible to arrange larger orders
mailed (contact us to arrange your larger order $100+
since the shopping cart will not accept it), as this is a
shipping method without the required signature
(convenience of not having to go to post office or be at
home, work or business in order to receive it), and thus
it is sent at your own risk. Usually the best shipping
method as it arrives quite fast and costs a small
fraction and often is free of charge for larger orders.
Will most likely be dropped into your mailbox, post
office box, or at your door and in some cases may be
handed to you by your friendly postman or postwoman.

PRIORITY AIR MAIL - Tracking is
available. Insurance (nor indemnity claim) is NOT
available. If desired purchase shipping insurance here or here. No recipient signature is collected. You
as the Customer who places the order is fully responsible
for the delivery of your order using such a mailing
method beyond the the post office of origin. NO service
to the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Chile, El
Salvador and some other important countries
unfortunately. Select this shipping method instead of AIR
MAIL or instead of REGISTERED MAIL so you can get a tracking
number, but be aware that it
may attract attention of the long fingers, because
of the flashy PRIORITY sticker it carries. Despite
presence of a tracking number, shipping with Priority
International Azul Mail (Tracked Air Mail) is on the
recipient's own risk since it carries no insurance. If
desired, you can purchase our private shipping insurance
in our store separately. Attention:
Large US cities (NYC, Miami etc.) (and of other countries
as well) may have corrupt postal services and mail theft
may be more frequent. (* EXPRÉS - CORREIO AZUL
INTERNACIONAL - PRIORITY AIR MAIL SERVICE WITH A TRACKING
NUMBER, UNINSURED). Oprerates on honesty and on karma
of the postal staff, and of everyone else.
REGISTERED AIR MAIL - To All Countries.
Insurance (indemnity) is limited to ~US$45! Maximum indemnity for
international registered mail is ~US$45. If
desired, purchase extra shipping insurance here or here. Only a dispatch record is provided by the
Postal Services (to North America). Tracking supposed to
be available on your country's postal service website
(except USA and Canada where no tracking information whatsoever is provided
for foreign inbound or outbound Registered Mail since
2009/2015 respectively). Mandatory signature is usually
required as proof of delivery, yet we now have numerous
reports from the U.S. recipients so far that the
Registered Mail mailed to them from Europe was found in
their regular mail boxes, without obtaining recipient's
signature. Also unreasonable returns-to-sender may happen
as well, right from the country's border or from a mail
sorting center (ISC), without an attempt to deliver it
further. This is the reason why we are trying to limit
usage of Registered Mail to the countries which do not
collect signature and do not provide full tracking for
Registered Mail. Select Priority Air Mail or Basic
Air Mail (although uninsured and sent on recipient's
risk) instead and save yourself some time and
frustration.
FEDEX EXPRESS - shipping to most
countries. Tracking is sometimes available on www.fedex.com (if any and usually late or even
incorrect, or is not updated for days, so please beware).
International Insurance with FedEx is limited to $100. If
desired purchase shipping insurance here or here. Quite a safe service, but much slower and
much less professional than in the past. Still somehow
fast delivery (usually or sometimes about 3 to 5 business
days after the shipment is picked up and delivered
to a large Fedex hub from where the tracking usually
begins), but can take up to 2 weeks or longer if Customs
clearance and national holidays are involved, as well as
some lately developed lax attitude and a broken online
tracking system. Flexible Banknotes.com shipping rates
depending on your order amount. The bigger the order
subtotal, the lower usually the shipping charge. Free
shipping for larger orders. Mandatory signature may be
required as proof of delivery. IMPORTANT: When the only
shipping option for your (larger) order in our store is
FedEx and you wish to have it shipped for less or by a
different shipping method, please contact us asking to
split your order into 2 or more (Registered, Air Mail or
Priority Intl) mail pieces (usually with shipping fees
adjustment) or place several separate smaller orders and
select appropriate shipping methods for each order.
FedEx requires a street address
and a telephone number of the
recipient. Not providing either one along with your order
may cause order processing and shipping delays (until the
abovementioned data is provided to us).
EXPRESS MAIL SERVICE (EMS) - We no longer ship via EMS -
expensive, slow and problematic shipping method
(unreasonable returns to sender, occasional shipment
loss, also collectible content detaining and seizing by
EMS and their delivery partner DHL is a growing problem).
Mandatory signature may be required as proof of delivery.
UPS - Shipping with UPS is unavailable
at this time due to local pick up unavailability (unless
customer provides us with their own UPS account number).
DHL - Shipping with DHL is unavailable
at this time due to local pick up unavailability and
attitude towards shipping our hobby collectibles.
REMARK: Sorry, we do not provide OVERNIGHT or SECOND DAY
(FedEx) delivery since we are not located near a majour
hub or city. FEDEX may take a day or a couple days longer
depending on the remoteness and popularity of the
destination. In some cases Fedex may take as long as
7-10+ working days to deliver (Customs clearance,
holidays etc.) and as fast as 2 days (after your package
reaches a majour FEDEX hub or distribution facility).
IMPORTANT NOTICE: if you wish your order to be shipped by
some other shipping method then please select any shipping method and indicate in
your order comments that you wish to select
"..........." shipping method and email that to us separately as well. We
will respond to you with a shipping cost for that
shipping method and if you agree then we will send you an invoice
adjustment for the right amount.

of certain countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it faster, select FedEx delivery instead.
You can track your order shipment (if tracking number is
provided) by going to, for example: Global Track & Trace or www.royalmail.com or www.usps.com or www.auspost.com.au or www.ctt.pt or www.epg.ae or www.fedex.com or for EMS Insured:
http://www.ems.post/tracking or another country's postal
service website (depending which service you are using
and where you live) or by logging into your account at Banknotes.com international store. Please note that
Registered Mail is not (fully) trackable (to USA and some other countries) even on a mail
carrier's website and may be only trackable by submitting
a written application or paying a visit to a post office
(up to 3 month wait for the results). Naturally: Air
Mail, First Class Mail, Surface Mail, Sea Mail, Normal
Mail, Basic mail, Economy Mail do not have tracking or
insurance. If desired purchase shipping insurance here or here.
Please note that BASIC MAIL (also known as: AIR MAIL,
REGULAR MAIL, SIMPLE MAIL, FIRST CLASS MAIL, ORDINARY
POST, STAMPED MAIL, NORMAL MAIL, ECONOMY MAIL) is sent at
buyer's own risk since it does not bear any insurance nor
a tracking number. If in doubt, and needing some
protection and/or a tracking number, please select
Registered Mail (partial tracking only (to North America)
with an indemnity limit of $45) or Priority Air Mail
(fully trackable but uninsured, thus unprotected)
shipping method instead. If desired purchase shipping insurance here or here.

How soon should I expect my ordered
items to arrive?
COVID-19 Notice:
There may be significant mail and courier delivery delays to a number of countries right now
due to a lack of available transport links and suspension
of certain countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it faster, select FedEx delivery instead.
The speed of delivery first of all depends on the method
of shipping you have selected yourself. Speed couriers
such as FedEx usually deliver within time frame of 3 to 7
days starting from a large hub (although FedEx tracking
system appears to be broken and their service has seen
better days). Government postal systems usually are
slower although quite often simple normal mail (a.k.a.
Air Mail) and Priority Mail may arrive almost as fast as
well.
The details given on delivery time periods are not
binding.
A generic answer to this question would be: 7 to
60 days. It also depends in which country you
reside, whether you live in a small town in a province or
in a big city close to international airpoirts and how
close your city is to a mail sorting center and many
other factors, such as customs and mail sorting center
(ISC etc.) delays. Customs of any country can hold
packages and letters for days and even weeks before
clearing them to continue to be delivered. Air Mail
letter usually takes about 7 to 20 days to arrive to
another country, but sometimes up to 30 or even 60 days.
These numbers are just approximate and may vary depending
on many factors and are completely OUT OF OUR CONTROL.
That means - WE CAN NOT CONTROL THE SPEED OF DELIVERY of
your order - only YOU CAN control it by selecting an
appropriate way of shipping during order placement
process.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please note that if you selected
Registered Mail shipping method you will have to pick the
shipment up at your local post office unless it decides
to deliver to your door and find you at the right time at
your residence, work or business. Otherwise as in most
cases please expect a mail delivery notice left in your
mail box. Look out for it. Please pick it up promptly
since many post offices only hold registered mail for up
to a week and then return it to the sender if it is not
picked up within 6-7 days! You will usually have to pay a
reshipment fee (in most cases).
In most cases your packages are shipped within 1 to 5
business days. During extra busy holiday times the time
it takes for us to prepare and ship your order may be
longer, but at least once a week. We do our best to ship
your orders as quickly as possible. Also please refer to
the item availability information published on the
product detail page.
Before contacting us please log in to your account to check shipment status of your
order. If your package was scheduled to arrive on a
specific day but did not arrive, please contact us or the
mail carrier (speed courrier).
The following are all
the shipping methods that are available at Banknotes.com
and an approximate time in business days (minimum and
maximum) that it takes for your order to arrive to your
location. Registered Air Mail for example usually takes a
couple or more weeks to arrive at foreign destinations
(although sometimes can take as little as 5 to 7 days!)
and it rarely takes as long as 30 to 60 days to
arrive. If it does not arrive after 60 days, - it is
probably lost and we will in such case submit a search and a claim to
postal authorities. Yet we had some Registered
packages
and even EMS (EMS is no longer provided due to the
unreasonable behaviour of the carrier) arrive to a remote
destination after 3 and even 4 months!
Currently available
shipping options are the following: (The details

shipping for larger orders. Mandatory signature may be
required as proof of delivery. IMPORTANT: When the only
shipping option for your (larger) order in our store is
FedEx and you wish to have it shipped for less or by a
different shipping method, please contact us asking to
split your order into 2 or more (Registered, Air Mail or
Priority Intl) mail pieces (usually with shipping fees
adjustment) or place several separate smaller orders and
select appropriate shipping methods for each order.
FedEx requires a street address
and a telephone number of the
recipient. Not providing either one along with your order
may cause order processing and shipping delays (until the
abovementioned data is provided to us).
EXPRESS MAIL SERVICE (EMS) - We no longer ship via EMS -
expensive, slow and problematic shipping method
(unreasonable returns to sender, occasional shipment
loss, also collectible content detaining and seizing by
EMS and their delivery partner DHL is a growing problem).
Mandatory signature may be required as proof of delivery.
UPS - Shipping with UPS is unavailable
at this time due to local pick up unavailability (unless
customer provides us with their own UPS account number).
DHL - Shipping with DHL is unavailable
at this time due to local pick up unavailability and
attitude towards shipping our hobby collectibles.
REMARK: Sorry, we do not provide OVERNIGHT or SECOND DAY
(FedEx) delivery since we are not located near a majour
hub or city. FEDEX may take a day or a couple days longer
depending on the remoteness and popularity of the
destination. In some cases Fedex may take as long as
7-10+ working days to deliver (Customs clearance,
holidays etc.) and as fast as 2 days (after your package
reaches a majour FEDEX hub or distribution facility).
IMPORTANT NOTICE: if you wish your order to be shipped by
some other shipping method then please select any shipping method and indicate in
your order comments that you wish to select
"..........." shipping method and email that to us separately as well. We
will respond to you with a shipping cost for that
shipping method and if you agree then we will send you an invoice
adjustment for the right amount.
Our store's shipping
confirmation email message may end up in your
mail program's or free mail service's (Yahoo, Google,
Hotmail etc.) "Spam" folder. Therefore please
before contacting us please check your "spam"
folder as well. Please adjust your "spam"
settings accordingly.
We are not responsible for actions of your country's
postal service and their employees or partners. We are
also not responsible if your mail is misdelivered, not
delivered or returned to the sender due to the incomplete
address provided to us by you in your order at
Banknotes.com. Your address must be 100% correct and
consistent throughout all places you provided it us with.
Reshipment to a corrected address at your fault will cost
you another shipping and handling (S&H) charge. Your
business, your patience and your understanding is truly
apppreciated.
Please note that usually there is only one person who
handles all orders, payments, packing, shipping, email
responses, phone calls etc. therefore your patience and
your understanding is appreciated. I am only human and I
do sometimes run behind schedule due to a huge workload,
sickness, unexpected technical difficulties, natural
disasters, vacation or a business trip. All your orders
will be taken care of and shipped as soon as possible and
I do appreciate your patience in case of a delay and I
will respond to all your order related inquiries in a
timely manner.
REQUEST: Please let us know when your order arrives and
whether you like and enjoy the items you received. We care about your orders and would
be great to hear from you about how you are doing and how
we can improve our service. Your
feedback is very welcome.

Will you ship my order to another
name and address?
We will only ship to a
bank-verified address (billing address). If you wish to
have your order shipped
to an address that
is different from your billing address on file with your
credit card provider, you must add
the shipping address to
your credit card and/or Paypal account. To do so, please
do the following:
1. Please contact your credit card provider (issuer) and
ask them if they allow you to add an alternate
shipping address on your account (their phone number
should be located on the back of your
card or on your monthly statement).
2. If possible, add the shipping name and/or address on
your order to the credit card file as an "authorized
alternate shipping address to your account". The
information will remain on file for future
orders. If the issuer does not allow shipping to an
alternate address, we will not be able to process
the order.
These regulations are established by the credit card
companies for any "card not present" mail, phone
and internet orders to prevent fraud. It is not
our policy; it is the policy of Visa, Mastercard, American
Express and Discover. We must comply with their
requirements and we take a very active
role to prevent online fraud. Suspicious orders are
reported to the issuing bank and the local authorities
and your IP address is logged in our system
for reference and investigation.
We treat your credit card with the highest level of
security. We understand that we lose some legitimate orders/customers
in the process and we pay this price to help protect your
credit.
Alternatively, to have your order shipped to another
person and/or address you may do the following
(A or B):
A. Go to http://www.banknotes.com/order.htm and print it out and fill out that
form completely. Please sign it with your
signature. Make sure you don't miss anything. In the
form enter all your credit card and billing and
shipping data and everything else. Then write an
explanation where you want your order sent and
what is the reason for it. Then make a good quality copy
of both sides of your credit or debit card and a good
quality copy of your photo ID or a passport. Then sign
the order form and sign every other page and email it all
to:
Our telephone and fax number will be provided to
you in the process of placing an order, in an invoice and
on our business card or via email. You can email us to
request our telephone and/or telefax number and/or
provide us with your telephone or fax number if you wish
to speak to us before you place an order. We will return
most order-related and some of the wish-to-sell inquiries
by telephone or via email. Otherwise we prefer to
communicate via email.
B. Send us a Cash
payment (by mail or by Western Union
money transfer; details upon request) and we will
ship your order to the person/address indicated in your
order via any shipping method of your choice.
IMPORTANT! Always make sure your address you provide us
in your order placement where you enter it by hand (not
just attached to your credit card account) is absolutely
correct and is correctly spelled and is complete. If it
includes an apartment number or a suite number or a
postal box number etc. it must be clearly and correctly
spelled and provided to us with your placed order as
typed or handwritten with your hand. We are not
responsible for actions of your country's postal service
and their employees or partners. We are also not
responsible if your mail is misdelivered, not delivered
or returned to the sender due to the incomplete address
provided to us by you in your order at Banknotes.com.
Your address must be 100% correct and consistent
throughout all places you provided it us with. Reshipment
to a corrected address at your fault will cost you
another shipping and handling (S&H) charge. Your
business, your patience and your understanding is truly
apppreciated.

How do I check the progress of my
Registered Mail shipment?
COVID-19 Notice:
There may be significant mail and courier delivery delays to a number of countries right now
due to a lack of available transport links and suspension
of certain countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it faster, select FedEx delivery instead.
You can track your order shipment (if tracking number is
provided) by going to, for example: Global Track & Trace or http://www.ems.post/tracking or www.royalmail.com or www.usps.com or www.auspost.com.au or www.ctt.pt or www.epg.ae or www.fedex.com or another country's postal
service website (depending which service you are using
and where you live) or by logging into your account at Banknotes.com international store. Please note that
Registered Mail is not (fully) trackable (to the USA and to some other countries) even on a mail
carrier's website and may be only trackable by submitting
a written application or paying a visit to a post office.
Naturally: Air Mail, First Class, Surface mail do not
have tracking.
The details given on delivery time periods are not
binding.
Please note that in a
lot of cases a REGISTERED MAIL (Recommandé,
Einschreiben, Raccomandata, Registrado, Musajjil,
Registrert, Registrerad, Polecony, 3AKA3HOE) REGISTRATION
NUMBER is a non-live look up number; it is not
always a tracking number. You may not see the full route
of your mail-piece online and it only may or may not
appear as delivered only after it is handed to you.
United States, Canada
postal services (USPS and Canada Post) (since 2009 and
2015), as well as some other countries postal services no
longer provide any tracking information for inbound and
outbound Registered international mail, although
Registered mail inbound into USA and Canada still
requires signature delivery. A lot of times that
signature is not collected and the so-called Registered
Mail is deposited into your regular mail box or a post
office box. The abolition and absense of tracking does not mean that we can not find out
whether the Registered mail piece was delivered or not,
by submitting a special document form to the postal
authorities, which after an investigation of the
whereabouts of the shipment reports to us on what has
happened to the shipment; whether it was delivered or
whether it was lost, misdelivered or still at the Customs
processing.
You must provide us with your complete, correct and well
spelled address during placement of your order, typed or
handwritten by your hand. Please verify it several times
to make sure itis correct. If returned to the sender we
will charge you another shipment charge if your address
provided to us is incomplete or incorrect.
Registered Mail
Tracking or Tracing supposed to be available on your
country's postal service website (except USA, Canada, and some other countries, where no tracking information whatsoever is provided
since years 2009/2015 respectively, for the US/CAN).
Mandatory signature is usually required as proof of
delivery, yet we now have numerous reports from the U.S. recipients so far that the
Registered Mail mailed to them from Europe was found in
their regular mail boxes, without obtaining recipient's signature.
This is the reason why we are trying to limit usage of
Registered Mail to
the countries which do not collect signature and/or do not provide full tracking for Registered Mail.
Please read the following article as well as search for
many more articles and forum posts like this online: https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/410wmy/tracking_suppression_of_international_registered/
Therefore, if you see NO TRACKING ONLINE for your order's
shipment, please don't panic and don't ring alarm bells. Please be patient instead, it will arrive as it always
does in 99,999% cases, and it will probably still need
your signature.
Also, and this small paragraph applies only
to those very few in between less-honest individuals,
who may want to trick us into believing
that
they did not receive their shipment, while it has already
been received by them. Once you receive your order via Registered Mail and still do not see the
online tracking info show it as "Delivered",
don't panic or jump-for-joy and don't
attempt
to report it as
"not received" in order to attempt to claim
your money back or to receive a refund, since we always submit requests for investigation on
whereabouts of every registered mail piece that is
reported as "undelivered" and please note that it is federal
and municipal crime to misreport any mail delivery. Also,
special tracking devices may be set within the envelope or
package (that react to any digital devices, TVs etc.), in
order to ensure proper and safe delivery.

I paid more to you for the shipping
(postage) than it appears on the envelope or on the
package that I received.
The price of shipping
(postage) on the envelope is not the only cost incurred
to ship an order. We must also include the following charges into
the shipping charge (Shipping & Handling - S&H):
Cost of the envelope(s), packaging, box, cardboard,
envelope stiffener, tape, paper, printing costs, packing
materials, plastic
sleeve(s) (holders), other supplies, delivery costs to
and from the post office, etc.
This
is why it is called "Shipping & Handling"
or S&H. Yet you will notice that we ship some larger
orders for much less and even at no extra cost to you.
It's called "Free Shipping". Test our store's
shopping basket for a variety of subtotal amounts to
verify.

shipment and to pay your own country's import taxes or

re-shipment fee and your order will be shipped to you
again; b) delivery of your order will be

When will my credit card be charged?
Credit cards are charged
when your order is ready to ship.  In some cases
your credit card will be charged within 24 hours before
your order actually ships if we are away or have
technical difficulties shipping your order sooner.
NOTICE: If your credit card is declined your order will
not get processed nor shipped and you will receive an
email from us. Please
always check validity of your credit or debit card before
placing an order to avoid delays with processing of your order and
possible cancellations. We do not ship any orders unless
we receive full payment
or
credit card authorization before we ship an order.

Will my credit card get charged
after I cancel my order?
Of course
NOT! If you cancel your order we do not process your
order. Therefore your credit (debit) card never gets charged after you cancel your order
with us. We will never charge anyone's card if we are not
authorised to do that.
Thus
if your order is cancelled, it means we do no business
and therefore we have no business charging your card. Your card gets authorized before
your order is processed and if you cancel your order, the
authorization on your card may take some
time to expire. So for some time you may see a temporary
"charge" (funds on hold due to authorization on your card -
verification of availability of funds on the card) on
your card for the amount you were placing (and then
canceling) an order for. After some time that
"charge" will be reversed and your card
actually never gets charged,
it only get authorized for that particular amount. And if
your order is cancelled, then we never go ahead with the final
"capture of funds". Rest assured that once you
trust us your credit/debit card, we will never charge you any hidden fees or
unauthorized amounts.

Why does your charge appear on my
card as "pending"?
This
pending transaction refers to a purchase you've made
without a PIN using your Check Card or sometimes
your Credit Card.
It has not yet posted to your account. A temporary
"hold" (known as an
"authorization hold") is placed on these funds at the
time of purchase. This hold will be removed from your
account either (1) when the actual transaction amount is
debited from your account in posted transactions,
or (2) approximately three business days after the
authorization, whichever occurs sooner. While
this hold will reduce the balance available to authorize subsequent Check Card transactions,
it will not affect the payment of other withdrawals such
as checks, electronic funds transfers or
previously authorized Check Card transactions.In some
cases, the amount of the pending transaction may not
match the actual amount of the transaction.
This is common. Some
merchants, including restaurants and hotels, will place
an initial hold
(known as an "authorization hold") on the
account for a higher or lower dollar amount.
Once
these types of transactions are processed, which may take
several days, the actual amount of the
transaction will be
posted to your account.

Why is my credit card payment
declined?
Generally, payments are
declined if our billing system is unable to verify the
billing information you've submitted.
Here's a troubleshooting checklist of possible causes:
Incorrect Credit
Card Number or Debit Card Number:
Make sure that the credit card or debit card number you
provide or we have on file for you is correct and
up-to-date.
Credit Card Number or Debit Card Number has spaces or
other characters between digits:
Make sure that your credit card number does not contain
any spaces, dashes, letters or any other characters other
than digits (numerals).
Incorrect expiration date:
Review the expiration date on your credit card or debit
card. If your card expired, use an up-to-date credit card
or debit card.
Incorrect billing address and phone number:
Make sure that the telephone number and billing address
listed in your account match those associated with your
payment method. Otherwise, our system will not be able to
process your charges. Either update your personal
information, or contact your payment institution to sync
up.
Credit card limit reached:
Check your credit limit. You may have reached your daily
or total credit card limit on the day we attempted to
charge your card. Your credit card should have enough
available credit to cover your order's amount. If your
card does not have enough credit, enter a new credit card
with a higher credit limit. You may also ask your bank to
increase your credit limit.
Maximum amount allowed for a single charge exceeded:
Check the maximum amount your card can be charged at a
single time. If the declined charge in your account is
higher than this amount, try asking your credit card
company to increase the limit. You can also enter a new
credit card with a higher limit.
Maximum number of charges card can receive in a period
exceeded:
Check how many times your card can be charged in given
time period. If you've exceeded this amount, you can try
submitting a new card. You can also talk to your bank
about increasing this limit or simply wait until your
card can be charged again.
Card doesn't accept charges from an online source:
Make sure your card allows online transactions. If not,
talk to your credit card company or enter a new credit
card to process the charge.
Card doesn't allow for international transactions:
Make sure that your card can accept international charges
if you live outside USA. If not, try entering a new card
to process the charge.
Your debit card has no funds available:
Add funds to your debit card (check card).
Usage of your credit or debit card was
temporarily blocked (suspended) by your card provider:
That can happen sometimes if a preceding transaction was
considered as suspicious by your card provider. Example:
your card was used to send a large amount of money to a
developing country before you tried to place an order
with us; This is a "no fault of your" case -
call your card provider to unblock your card and place
your order with us again.
In rare cases our virtual credit card terminal
can be under maintenance or it may fail:
Please try again soon or try later.
Your billing address may be incorrect:
You may have entered an old billing address (address
where you receive your card's bills) or you may have
mistyped your billing address. Check, correct and try
again.
A lost or even a stolen card or stolen card's
data may be used (nothing personal):
We can not help in this case, but if you are honestly
unaware that you may be using someone else's card, please
call the card's provider company to verify. We will not
under any circumstances accept anyone else's lost or
stolen credit card's payment.
IMPORTANT: in some rare cases even if
you get a "DECLINED" message it may be a system
error. We will sometimes attempt to charge your card
manually and see if it gets declined again. If it does
not get declined when we manually process your card
payment, your order will most likely will be processed.
In case if you still don't know what went wrong, please
try to use a back up credit card or pay us using an
alternative way of payment.

Why is my credit card payment
authorised, but marked as "Fraud"?
Sometimes
our virtual card processing terminal does that. It marks
the order as "FRAUD" but gives the
"APPROVED" message next to the card. In such
case please don't panic. There's no need to cancel your
order yet. We will attempt to manually charge your card
and if all goes well, your order will be processed and
shipped. Otherwise we will email you to let you know what
can be done to process your order.

Why is my debit card, check card or
ATM card being charged twice?
Well, first of all, we
never charge anyone's card more than once, yet your
financial institution (your card provider) or a payment
processing entity may in rather rare cases put a
hold/reserve on your card account twice the amount of
your order. It means the payment processing entity will
place a hold on both your Bank Account and your
Debit Card for the amount of your order. That may happen
in some cases when you use a Debit Card (Check Card) that
is linked to your Bank Account as your back up funding
source. That usually happens with money transfers rather
than when placing merchandise orders online. The hold on
your Debit Card decreases your available line of credit
by the amount of your order. If your card says Check,
Debit, or ATM on the front, this may in rather rare cases
put a temporary duplicate hold/reserve on your card until
your order ships and until funds on your card are
captured, which means when your card is charged a final
single amount by us. After that the second hold/reserve
should be released and the first hold becomes a permanent
and a single charge on your card. If the release does not
happen within 4-to-7 days, please contact your card
provider and us.

Why is there a second, smaller
charge on my card?
Please note that if you
are ordering from another country (outside of USA) using
your credit card or debit (savings, electron, etc.) card,
you may be charged an extra, a second charge (a so-called
"Cross-Border Fee"), which will be much smaller
than your order amount and your card statement will
probably show it as being charged by us as well. Yet we
do not charge this fee, your credit card provider, your
bank or some other company does the charge, which we
disagree with. So, that fee is charged by and on behalf
of Visa and Mastercard authority or corporation
regardless that we do not like these fees to be charged
to our customers and to ourselves as well. We believe
these fees, especially when charged using
merchant's (our) name are
unfair; yet we have no choice, but to accept those fees
on foreign transactions. Otherwise we would not be able
to accept your cards at all. So, I do not initiate nor
charge the "Cross Border Fee".
Effective April 2, 2005, International Visa Card Issuers
may be applying an optional issuer surcharge/fee to
transactions where the merchant is located outside the
country where the customer's credit card was issued.
This likely means that you are being affected by this
surcharge. The surcharge is being applied directly by
your credit card issuer and should not be mistaken for a
billing error on our part or by our merchant service
provider. Many cardholders are not yet aware of this Visa
or Mastercard policy change, and therefore we explain to
you, that the additional amount is a Fee applied directly
by your Visa or Mastercard Financial Institution.
Effective October 1, 2005, MasterCard is imposing a fee
on: (a) Cross-border transactions on U.S. issued
MasterCards and (b) cross-border transactions on
MasterCard-branded credit cards that are issued outside
the U.S. region, but are acquired within the U.S. region.
So this issue may or may not applied to those who reside
outside of the United States of America.
UPDATE: This is what shows up on my bank account after
they charge me a cross-border debit card fee:
What is this fee?
An International Transaction Fee is assessed when you use
your debit card for purchases in foreign currency or
in US dollars with a foreign merchant, including U.S.
internet transactions with a foreign merchant. This fee
is also assessed when you use your debit card or ATM card
to obtain foreign currency from an ATM. The International
Transaction Fee is a percentage of the U.S. dollar amount
of each purchase or ATM withdrawal.

How do I navigate the site?
First of all, to purchase
banknotes and other goods you can either use text pricelist with "Add-to-Cart" links
in it and with ability to view larger images and text or
you can go directly to the shopping cart interface and purchase from there whichever
you prefer. Contents of both, the text pricelist and the shopping cart store is almost exactly the same (only for
banknotes) and both are interconnected. Regarding other
collectibles, such as coins, stamps, labels, lottery
tickets, bonds etc. Those are not listed in the text pricelist and should be viewed and purchased
only from the shopping cart interface.
You can either use our search feature(s) (either at the home page (and many other pages) or in the store interface) to enter in the type of product you are
looking for, or you can navigate by using our categories
shown on the left hand side of the website. Some
categories will have subcategories that will be displayed
at the top middle section of the website once you click
on the category name.

click on a category with a certain letter "World
Banknotes A to Z"
and then sort the notes by Country Names. You will also
notice that you can sort the products by product code
(which usually matches the "Pick" number),
price etc.
Please do not attempt to contact us or to order any
banknotes or other items from the Currency Gallery. Many bank notes and other items on the Gallery pages are not available (sold, not for
sale, images were donated, etc. While some or many items
in the Gallery may be available to purchase from our Store,
please do not contact us about availability of Gallery items. Go to the Store
instead and order from there. Item availability in our store is usually very close to 100%. So just go
ahead and place your orders.

How do I use "Add-to-Cart"
links on Banknotes.com?
It's a very simple
procedure, but you have to understand how it works so you
can keep on using it all the time. If you wish to use
Banknotes.com text pricelist instead of using our storefront with thumbnail pictures, then let us
explain to you in steps how it works:
1. Before you begin shopping at Banknotes.com it is recommended to go to our store
and register (new customers) or login (existing customers) and then either go
shopping right there
or (go to the next step below):
2. Go to http://www.banknotes.com/pricelst.htm and read all the terms,
conditions and other helpful info
there (recommended);
3. Begin browsing our text pricelist by clicking on A to Z
letters on that page;
4. When you see a product that you like,
simply click on the "[Add-to-Cart]" link
right next to it and do nothing else. Your product has
been added! That way you can fill up your cart faster
without being sent to it every time you add a product
into a cart! Keep on doing this (adding to cart) until
you are finished shopping and then click on the "View Cart" link in the
upper menu of every A to Z page to view the contents of
your cart (basket);
5. Please note that by clicking on
"Add-to-Cart" link once you are adding only 1
(one) product each time. If you wish to update quantities
(2 to 10) then you have to go to the shopping cart and update desired quantities for all your
ordered products there. Or you can keep on clicking on
Add-to-Cart links and every extra click adds yet another
piece of same item to your cart;
6. And finally if you like what you see
in your shopping cart (basket), then proceed to checkout, proceed with payment and wait for your
order to arrive. Simple as 1 to 6!

How many different products can my
cart/basket carry?
The number of products to
be placed in a customer's shopping cart (basket)
theoretically is unlimited, but we suggest adding 200 or
less different products into your cart per order. If you
need to order more than 200 different products, then
please submit several orders and we will charge you only
one shipping fee if your orders are placed on the same
day at the same time.
If you add more than 200 different products (quantity of
each in this case is not important) into your shopping
cart, it is possible (or not) that your cart may or will
become inaccessible, blank, or you may be unable to send
your order through to us. In such case please contact us.
Non-logged in customer's carts are cleared on closing
their browsers, and logged-in users' cart data is stored
in a cookie and therefore contents of the registered (and
logged in) user is saved for your future use. Therefore
if you add products into your shopping cart (basket)
while being logged-in, and then log out and leave without
placing an order, you can come back and find your cart
full the next time you login to your Banknotes.com
account.
Quantity per each identical product is limited to 100,
but you can order more by calling (phoning) us or you can
update the quantity during checkout. If you select 2
(two) or more identical items, they may or may not be
available in that particular quantity. If the products
are not available in that quantity, your order will in
most cases still be processed for what's available. If
you need more than 100 of each item then please note that
in your order or contact us.

My shopping cart / basket has become
empty after I've added items into it.
This has happened most
likely because you have disabled "cookies"
and/or javascript in your browser. This commonly happens if you have
something like Norton Internet Security package installed
and have the security level set too
high. Cookies and javascript must be
turned on as they are used to

Also it will happen if you add products into your
shopping cart without registering and logging in and then
leaving our store or
closing the browser. To make sure your shopping cart /
basket does not become empty please register and log in before or after you are
done adding products into it.

I did not receive my order and it's
been 30/60 days since it was shipped
COVID-19 Notice:
There may be significant mail and courier delivery delays
to a number of countries right now due to a lack of
available transport links and suspension of certain
countries' postal operations due to the COVID-19
situation worldwide, therefore in many cases expect much
slower delivery of your order and please be very patient.
If you need it fast, select FedEx delivery instead.
Sorry to hear that. If you have
selected BASIC MAIL (an envelope and a stamp) as your
shipping method, there is nothing we can do to help,
since it is being sent on a buyer's own risk. Otherwise
please read on. It is IMPERATIVE that you do not email us
without reading this entire response first. Trust us, we did our work properly.
When mail is delayed or goes missing, everyone suffers,
the sender and the recipient. It takes time to
investigate the whereabouts of the letter or the package
and it takes extreme patience to not get upset over it.
Please believe us that your order/mail has been properly
prepared, properly processed, properly addressed and
properly shipped out to you, making sure your address and
even your telephone number is clearly and carefully
spelled and sometimes, if in doubt, even checked on the
internet for correctness. We do our job putting your
order together and mailing it out to you, so why get
upset with us after we did our job corectly? Please be
patient, and contact us only if you do not receive your
order after at least 30 or 60 days after it has appeared
on the tracking information as "Internationally
Dispatched". That means NOT since the date you
placed your order, since it takes a few more days to
process it, to pack it properly, to mail it out and to
reach an International Service Center (ISC), where it is
properly and promptly directed to your destination, but
since the date it was despatched internationally or at
least since the date it was accepted by our local post
office.
Please note that we are not responsible for
"timely" delivery of your order via REGISTERED
MAIL (or any other shipping method even if that is FEDEX)
since there is no time limit or guarantee of any sort or
kind by any postal authority as Registered Mail can
arrive in as little as 3-5 days and can take as long as
3-4 months to arrive (on rare occasions) with average
being 2 to 3 weeks. In other words: The details given
on delivery time periods are not binding. Therefore
you will not be rembursed for "late" or
"delayed" delivery via REGISTERED MAIL or even
via FEDEX just because it arrived late and placing unfair
chargebacks (payment reversals) is not recommended as we
do address and report such practices via proper channels.
If you are concerned to receive your order fast, within 7
to 12 days (or faster), you should select FEDEX delivery
only.
Registered Mail "Tracking" (or rather Tracing
with only a despatch record) supposed to be available on
your country's postal service website (except USA, Canada
and some other countries, where no tracking information
whatsoever is provided since years 2009/2015
respectively, for US/CAN). Mandatory signature is usually
required as proof of delivery, yet we now have numerous
reports from the U.S.
recipients so far that the Registered Mail mailed to them
from Europe was found in their regular mail boxes,
without
obtaining recipient's
signature. This is the reason why we are trying to
eliminate or to severely limit usage of Registered Mail to the countries which do not
collect signature for Registered Mail.

Services of any country, and we do not run Federal
Express etc. Also we do not deliver your order in person
(as much as we'd like to) since we use International
Postal Services (Ordinary Mail, Registered Mail or
Priority Mail) or Federal Express (FedEx) only. We depend
on these services to deliver your order to your home,
work, business or to your post office box. We submit your
mail piece to these services on your request
(accordingly to your placed order) and we do our job
properly. If the mail services fail to do their job
properly, we both suffer, you and us, and thus let's be
patient and wait, cause we are doing everything possible
to search for your delayed or missing mail piece. And
therefore getting upset with us for a delayed or missing
mail piece will only have someone get a heart attack and
not move anything faster. Thus if your order shipment is
delayed, please only contact us if it's been AT LEAST:
- FedEx shipments ONLY: 15 days;
- Registered Mail shipments: 30 days to big cities in the
developed countries only;
- Registered Mail shipments: 60-90 days to smaller
cities, towns and villages in the developed and
developing world.
Here's why mail can be slow or slower than you expect it
to be:
Reason # 1: Holidays: During Christmas and New Year and
other holidays mail can be slow or it can even
"disappear", since a lot of outsiders are or
may be hired by your country's government postal services
in order to help them out with their hopeless holiday mail volume.
Some of those outsiders (school children, students,
foreigners etc.) may be
tempted
to steal your mail piece since they feel they are not
permanent employees of the Postal Service and may not have been sworn-in to be fully
honest (big problem). Thus things like that rarely but do
happen. Please remain patient and remember that we do not insure
orders with full amount, beyond the $40-$45 postal
indemnity unless we are
requested
to do so (except FEDEX which is fine). Sometimes a full
insurance is just unavailable to your destination.
Reason # 2: (USA + CANADA mostly) ISC NEW YORK or ISC
MIAMI, or another International Mail Service or Sorting Center delays. ISC NEW YORK etc. can hold your
REGISTERED MAIL piece for days, weeks or even months
without breaking a sweat.
Gladly that does not happen very often. USPS service has
been getting worse since year 2005-2009 always complaining that they never make a profit, but postal
charges are going through the roof, exceeding European and world postal charges and fees
by several times fold. Please
be patient and let the ISC (International Service Center
that sorts your mail for days and weeks, sometimes for months... but they do
deliver it most of the time. Call "your local"
ISC if you become impatient and need to vent.
Also, please Google-search for "NOTORIOUS ISC NEW YORK" (ISC
MIAMI, ISC LA) on the
internet. Pease do not
vent
on us in any way. 99% of mail delays to beautiful
North America are now caused by ISC NEW YORK etc. Also
please check the following 2009 USPS law (there was a
similar law released in 2015 in Canada as well):
http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2009/pb22259/html/updt_004.htm (Hint: FedEx)
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2009/04/02/E9-7373/international-inbound-registered-mail-procedures
Reason
# 3: Customs (Douane) delays. Customs processing takes
time, sometimes days or even weeks. Please be patient or call your local Customs
Department if you become impatient and need to vent.
Please do not vent on us in any way. After doing our
hard work we will not like it, although we will address
it immediately if you insist and you will not make things easier for anyone
neither speed up the delivery in any
way. Also it could be that when CUSTOMS of the country of destination is holding on to a mail piece with
your ordered items inside of it and
they may have sent you
a MAIL
PICK UP NOTICE by mail, which you may have not received.
Thus it may make sense to
also call and ask the Customs as well as
your post office and ask them whether they have been placing mail pickup notifications
into your mail box or whether
they have any RETURN TO SENDER mail in the processing that is being returned
to a foreign country (us)
undelivered. In some cases the sometimes-lazy and
ignorant postal service simply
won't bother much to deliver your mail or your mail pick up notice and will
return it to the sender without waiting long enough for
you to come and sign for it. Apply as much pressure, filing
complaints about such
"services" as possible, to prevent such
problems in the future. There always must be a friendly
postal clerk, who will handle your mail with care for you
if you ask nicely.
Reason # 4: It may have been sent back to the sender
(us). RETURN TO SENDER and/or UNDELIVERABLE stamp is
usually placed on the undelivered envelope and there it
goes, back to us. In some cases, quite often, if the
delivery person (postal clerk, postman etc.) does not
find the recipient at home for once or twice or within
usually 6 to 7 days (business days or not), they may
return the shipment back to the Sender (to us). Ask
around at your end to speed up the process. We will let
you know as soon as we receive the returned mail.
Re-shipping your order will be arranged.
Reason # 5: Incomplete
or incorrect address was provided to us by the Customer.
Always make sure your address you provide us in your
order placement where you enter it by hand (not just
attached to your credit card account) is absolutely
correct and is correctly spelled and is complete. If it
includes an apartment number or a suite number or a
postal box number etc. it must be clearly and correctly
spelled and provided to us with your placed order as
typed or handwritten with your hand. We are not
responsible for actions of your country's government and
postal service and their employees or partners. We are
also not responsible if your mail is misdelivered, not
delivered or returned to the sender due to the incomplete
address provided to us by you in your order at
Banknotes.com. Your address must be 100% correct and
consistent throughout all places you provided it us with.
Reshipment to a corrected address at your fault will cost
you another shipping and handling (S&H) charge. Also, if you provide us with an
unsafe address in an unsafe location, such as a war zone
or a prohibited area etc. we may not be able to even
initiate a search for your lost Registered mail piece.
You as a purchaser are fully responsible to provide us
with a correct address at a safe destination that does
not have any issues with military or political conflicts,
prohibitions or known and recurring mail theft problems.
Reason # 6: In a very unlikely case, the mail piece has
been lost or stolen if it is undelivered after 3-4
months. Yes, quite often
Registered mail takes that long to arrive even within short distances.
It is now time to submit the "missing mail search request form" and to
re-ship your order as soon as we receive a response from the postal authority
about whereabouts of your
shipment. If they still find it, they will still deliver it to you. That actually
does happen when they finally find the
shipment and finally deliver it, especially under
pressure. I've had a friend in the USPS, who told me they keep the unclaimed mail for some
time, then open it and sell on auction if no one claims
it within reasonable time. Usually it should get sent to
the sender. That actually happens quite often and in some cases the
undelivered REGISTERED MAIL or
EMS package or envelope is being held until they receive inquiry and
complaint about it (!)
and
only a filed and documented complaint makes it move and gets suddenly delivered! (Remark: we no longer
use EMS).
Please be assured that after you contact us with your
concern, we will submit an official search form to our
local postal authorities and will inform you via email as
soon as we hear from them. The postal authority research
may take up to 3 months or 90 days (usually that's the
maximum, but exceptions apply) for processing. While
waiting for the resolution, in the meantime here's
what you can do, on your end, to possibly speed
up the process. Please read on, below.
Ask your neighbours,
family members, relatives living in the same house, condo
or flat, ask friends, roommates living with you etc., whether they may
have received your mail for you and
forgot to pass it on to you or perhaps they left on a very important and urgent
vacation or a
business trip and forgot to pass your mail to you, thus
delaying the delivery by
days and weeks. It does happen on a rare occasion, from our extensive experience, we
can assure you, all kinds of things happen, and not always because of a bad intent.
Ask around your town (neighbours, friends, relatives,
co-workers, strangers, postal clerks, local thieves,
etc.) whether they had problems with receiving foreign
mail in that particular postal code, ZIP code, town or
city (via regular-ordinary, registered
or Priority mail = those three
methods) and if possible, please let us know the result (what
they said). That may
help the investigation and to prevent mail loss in the
future. Because your local post office or local mail
sorting
center may have become corrupt and there may
be even one or more employees who may simply be stealing
(some say: keeping)
people' s mail.
Please note that contacting us after just 5 or 10 or 15
days is "fruitless", and will slow down order
processing for everyone else, as we will be answering all
the emails that we would rather not, since your shipment
will still be on its way to you, or it may be delayed at
your country's Customs, or in some cases it may be on its
way to us, after it's been attempted to deliver and your
local postal services were unable to deliver it because:
a) They were unable to find anyone at your home or to
deliver the mail and to receive recipient's signature;
b) The Mail Delivery Notice (usually a red, orange,
brown, blue, green or a yelow piece of paper or cardboard
notifying the recipient to come to a post office at a
certain time to pick up their Registered or Express mail
piece and sign for it) did not reach your mail box or was
misplaced by postal employees or someone after its
delivery to a mail box;
c) Your address was incorrect as provided in your order
to us. Always verify it several times for correctness. We
do not misspell addresses as we are very careful.
In such case your order will be or may be on its way to
us and all we both can do is wait and once received it
will be re-shipped to you. No refund requests are granted
because of mis-delivery by postal services and for any
other cause that is not a fault of ours.
We submit investigation documents to postal authorities
for every severely delayed or lost mail piece. And we
will provide you with the investigation results upon your
request.
Always submit your postal service failure COMPLAINTS,
most just ones for every failure of your local postal
service to your post office, Postmaster, your Postal
Inspectors, Postal Authority, including Ministry of
Comunications of your country, your county government,
your state government, your representatives and make sure
to complain about serious non-delivery, unfair
"unclaimed" return cases, cases of mail loss
and theft, mail delivery delay, etc. Complain about
postal employees to make sure the lazy and the
incompetent ones are fired, lose their jobs, and are
replaced with those who value their job and are caring
and professional enough to safely and reasonably deliver
your mail. We know how PAINFUL mail non-delivery can be
and therefore reasonably complain for all the problems.
Submit your complaints on paper and online in person, by
mail, by fax, and make sure you get a written and stamped
confirmation, signature, etc. and do follow up on all
complaints until a satisfactory resolution is reached.
WARNING: It is a
UNIVERSAL, FEDERAL AND LOCAL CRIME to misreport delivered
mail as not received. This is in case if the mail gets delivered and the
recipient does not report it or misreport it as "not
received". This does not apply to 99,999% of
people. If you did not receive
the mail piece, there is nothing to worry and let the
investigation be processed first.
Please do not email us without reading all of the above
first. Please do read it twice, so you can better
understand everything. Thank
you for your business, patience and understanding.
Everything that is fair ends up fairly.

manual authorization, verification of your references and
other data. All that is done in order to protect your

What else do I have to know so my
order is processed with certainty?
For security reasons (and
to prevent possible fraud, electronic shoplifting, some
possible unfair chargebacks and chargeback-fraud) certain
orders may not be processed and shipped timely, if at
all, if all or some of the following applies to your
order (orders that are paid with credit or debit card or
Paypal):
a) When submitting your order (paying with a credit or
debit card or Paypal) you are using a free web email
address such as, but not limited to: Hotmail, Yahoo,
Gmail (Googlemail) etc. and only in combination
with the other factors mentioned below.
Exceptions apply.
b) Your credit or debit card order is for an amount over
US$100 in combination with a free webmail account and an
urgent delivery request, but not limited to, etc. and in
combination with the other red flags mentoned
here. Exceptions apply.
c) Your order is for a small amount (example: $25) and
your shipping cost is very high (example: $65 via FEDEX).
In such case please either submit a larger order or go
with the option "B" below by paying us with a
cash method or you can pay us only for the merchandise
(special arrangement) and use your own UPS, FEDEX or DHL
account (if no account - sign up with them) to pay the
shipping charges yourself directly to those speed
couriers. In such case you will have to either provide us
with your UPS, FEDEX or DHL account, or, if you will wish
to keep your speed courier account private, to schedule a
pick up at our office address, which (address) will be
provided to you upon your request and after your order
has been processed.
d) You are ordering mainly hard currency (current
banknotes / bills that can be easily exchanged in banks)
and especially if you order larger denomination banknotes
/ bills and pay with a credit/debit card or Paypal in
combination with the other factors mentioned above and
below.
e) The shipping method that you selected is a speed
courier, such as: FedEx, but in combination with several
of the other factors mentioned above and below.
f) You are asking to ship your order to a different
address than your credit or debit card's billing address
(address that your bank statement is sent to and which is
verified by your card provider) but not limited to and
may be also in combination with several of the other
factors mentioned above and below.
g) You are asking to ship to a different name than the

we will only ship to a Confirmed Shipping Address. Therefore please
make sure you are a VERIFIED
Paypal member and that your shipping-to address is in a CONFIRMED status. Reasonable exceptions apply.
Paypal accounts of some countries can not have a
Confirmed Address, - in such case your account must be
Verified and have a good long-standing history of
successful payments.
i) We and/or other merchants had significant problems
with your credit/debit card payment or with excessive
returns and especially chargeback or chargeback attempts
or even chargeback threats in the past and for no good
reason.
k) You have made unfair, impatient or fraudulent payment
reversals (chargebacks) to us or to other merchants in
the past for no good reason and at no fault of ours or
theirs.
l) FedEx requires a street address
and a telephone number of the
recipient. Not providing either one along with your order
may cause order processing and shipping delays (until the
abovementioned data is provided to us).
To avoid delays in processing your order, if any two or
more factors of the above applies, we recommend that you
send a cash payment (cash in the mail, Western Union
money transfer or a bank wire transfer). In some cases a confirmation
letter may be necessary from a victim (merchant, swap
partner) that you have settled accounts with them.

I am getting a questionmark (?) on
GMAIL while receiving emails
If you
see a questionmark (?) and/or get any kind of
"phishing" or "spoof" warning from
Google while receiving your order confirmation email from
Banknotes.com (and from other senders) or while you are
emailing us directly, please keep in mind that most
likely it is a FALSE NEGATIVE, FALSE POSITIVE or in other
words a FALSE ALARM and those are usually Google's frills
and antics to become aware of those possible security
related situations. Yet just in case please check it
anyway to rule out real spoofs, spams, viruses and
phishing attempts. If you have placed an order on
Banknotes.com and you are receiving an order confirmaton
right away or within minutes, that's most likely our
email and it is safe to open it. A lot of ISPs react to
newsletters and order forms like that and that is a FALSE
ALARM. In such case, if you are concerned, or if you
prefer, please email us at the following email address
and forward the "problem" email to us as well:

help?
If you would like to
phone or call Banknotes.com, please do so as long as you
have a serious cause for that such as:
a) You would like to place an order over the phone
(please email us first);
b) You wish to find out the status of your order (info
available on your Banknotes.com or Paypal account);
c) You have a problem with your order, payment or trouble
submitting or receiving your order;
d) Any other order related issues, inquiries and
questions;
e) You own a collection of really rare banknotes and wish
to sell it to us (please use online form for appraisal requests) and are
unable to use email or mail instead;
If you have a problem placing or receiving your
order, just email us and we will get back to you right
away.
Please note that we do not have secretary answer the
phone, therefore please be brief and to the point. The
person who will answer the phone may have an accent
(American or European) and may not be trained to speak
fluently, but we are located in Europe and North America
and we do NOT outsource our calls. Your phone call will
reach us either at home (if you call late, after or
before business hours, which is NOT recommended) or in
the office.
Telephone & Facsimile (please email us first):
Our telephone and fax number will be provided to
you in the process of placing an order, in an invoice and
on our business card. Please email us to request our
telephone and/or telefax number and/or provide us with
your telephone or fax number if you wish to speak to us
before you place an order. We will return most
order-related and some of the wish-to-sell inquiries by
telephone. Also, when placing your order online if you
select "Order by Phone or Fax" you will be able
to see our telephone and telefax number. In all other
cases we prefer to communicate with you via email.
UNIDENTIFIED PHONECALLS (*Blocked Call* or *Unknown
Caller*) may not be answered, therefore please make sure
your phone call device is capable to show and project
your name and/or phone number. If you wish not to
disclose your phone number (see our privacy statement)
then use email. Thank you for your understanding.

Thank you for your business! Happy collecting!
