Privacy Policy
Statement of Intent
From time to time, you may be asked to submit personal information
about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc) in order to receive or
use services on our website, or when submitting support requests or
general queries.
By entering your details in the fields
requested, you enable Chronolux and its service providers to provide you
with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal
information, we will treat that information in accordance with this
policy. Our services are designed to give you the information that you
want to receive. We will act in accordance with current legislation and
aim to meet current Internet best practice.
When you supply any
personal information to Chronolux for whatever reason we have legal
obligations towards you in the way we deal with that data. We must
collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use
it (see the notices on particular webpages that let you know why we are
requesting the information) and tell you if we want to pass the
information on to anyone else. In general, any information you provide
to us will only ever be used within our company and by its service providers.
It will never be supplied to anyone outside the company without first
obtaining your consent, unless we are obliged or permitted by law to
disclose it.
Also, if you post or send offensive or inappropriate
content anywhere on or to our website, we can use whatever information
that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour. This may
include informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school
or e-mail provider about the content and your behaviour.
We will
hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the
service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose
has been met. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is
held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
If
you are notified on our site that your information may be used to allow
Chronolux to contact you for "service administration purposes", this
means that we may contact you for a number of purposes related to the
service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you
with password reminders or notify you that the particular service has
been suspended for maintenance.
Although we prepare a quartery newsletter, we will not contact you for promotional
purposes, such as notifying you of improvements to the service or new
services unless you specifically agree to be contacted for such purposes
at the time you submit your information on the site, or at a later time
if you sign up specifically to receive such promotional information.
