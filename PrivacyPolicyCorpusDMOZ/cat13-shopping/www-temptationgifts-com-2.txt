Company History and Philosophy
Temptation was started in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, in 1983, by Mike and Sheena Adams. They had a simple retailing philosophy:
shopping should be fun!
Mike and Sheena set about creating a store that would sell unusual gifts, at a price people could afford, and to make sure that customers felt comfortable while shopping. They felt, (and still feel), that too many shops take their customers for granted, so they tried to create stores where customers feel welcome, are listened to rather than sold to, and where the goods on offer are priced within the reach of all budgets.
Making a purchase
How to Use the Site
Navigate through the site using the navigation bar at the top of every page. Many sections have subsections, so use the links on the section pages, to browse each subsection. Once you are viewing one of our "thumbnail pages" you will see small images and brief descriptions of our products. If you wish to, you can click on these small images to view larger images and more detailed descriptions.
Your Shopping Cart
Viewing the contents of your Cart
At any time you can check the contents of your shopping cart by clicking the "CART" button at the top right hand side of every page.
Adding an item to your Cart
To add an item to your cart, click the "Buy" button which can be found on both the thumbnail view and the single-page view. You will be redirected to the Cart page for a couple of seconds (so you can see the item has been successfully added to your Cart) then you will automatically return to the page you were viewing and you can continue shopping.
Adding gift wrap or other ancillary products
If you wish to have your item professionally gift wrapped and ribboned for a charge of £2.95, tick the Giftwrap checkbox next to the "Buy" button before clicking "Buy". Should you wish to add gift wrapping to an item already in your basket, you will need to remove it from the basket and then re-add it to your basket with Giftwrap selected.
The same processes apply on some items to adding a gift box, cellophaned Belgian chocolates, batteries, necklace extensions or other additional and ancillary products.
Removing an item from your Basket
If you place an item into your basket which you later decide you no longer wish to buy then you can remove it by clicking "Basket", selecting that item in the checkbox in the Remove column, and clicking Update.
Changing the quantity of an item
If you would like to buy more than one of any item you can amend the quantity field next to the Buy button at the time of purchase. The default quantity will always be 1. Alternatively you can amend the quantity of items already in your Basket by going to Basket, amending the quantity and clicking Update.
The Checkout
Confirming your purchase on TemptationGifts.com
When you have finished browsing and are ready to purchase your goods, go to the checkout by clicking the Checkout button on the right hand side of any page, or by clicking Checkout Now on the Basket page. On the first checkout page, your order totals including shipping will be confirmed and you can enter your billing address details, and delivery address details if they are different. You will be required to enter your name, e-mail address, home address and telephone number.
(This information is required so that we are able to send you your receipt and goods, or contact you if there are any problems with your order. Your details will never be transferred or sold to a third party. For more information on our privacy policy see below.)
Then click Next. On the second checkout page you will be required to choose your delivery method and you can enter any notes to our staff, and/or coupon code you may wish to enter. Then click Next. On the final checkout page you can confirm your order details and click Next to be transferred to secure payment pages.
Choosing how to pay - credit/debit card or PayPal
You will be transferred to a secure webpage hosted by leading payment service provider, Opayo (SagePay). Here you can select which credit or debit card you'd like to use. We accept Mastercard, Visa, Visa Debit (Delta), Visa Electron and American Express cards. Alternatively you can choose to pay by PayPal or by Amazon Pay
Paying by credit or debit card
Having selected a card to use, you will need to enter your credit card details to complete your order. You need not have any concerns over the security of these details as all the credit cards will be encrypted on the site. For more information please have a look at our Credit Card Security Section.
Paying by PayPal
Having selected PayPal you can either log in to your account or create one, and follow on screen instructions to confirm your payment.
Receipt Page
Once your transaction is authorized you will be redirected to the TemptationGifts.com Receipt page showing details of your order, and you will receive an automated email as written confirmation of our receipt of your order and your payment. This page and/or this email can be printed for your records. If you wish to place another order or continue browsing the site click Done, otherwise close the window or navigate away.
Ordering by Telephone
If for any reason you would prefer to place your order over the phone you are welcome to do so. You can call our helpful and friendly customer service team between 9:00am and 5:00pm GMT, 7 days a week, on +44 1494 790424. They will process your order securely and responsibly on your behalf and take credit/debit card payment over the phone.
Order Acceptance
Please note that completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your order. Our acceptance of your order will only occur when the items have been dispatched and a confirmation of dispatch has been sent.
Currency Converter
Using the Converter
On the top right hand side of every page is a Currency Converter. Click over the text "converts to approx" to open a menu and choose a different currency in which to display all the prices on the site. You can display our GBP prices in US dollars, Euros, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Indian rupees or Swiss francs. Having clicked a currency, the menu will disappear and the current conversion rate of that currency with £1.00 GBP will be displayed. All prices throughout the site will be displayed, converted at that rate, in the selected currency.
Currency Rates
The international currency rates are automatically updated every day from a feed sourced from international markets and the Reuters news agency. The rates are automatically updated on this site and will change from day to day with market fluctuations. If an updated international rate is not available on any given day for any reason the previous available rate will be displayed.
How You Will Be Charged
TemptationGifts is wholly owned and run by Temptation Gifts Ltd., a UK based business which carries out all its transactions in GBP (£ sterling). Your credit or debit card statement will show the charge in £s. The amounts displayed when using the currency converter are of necessity close approximations and should not be misconstrued for a contractual agreement over the exact amount in the displayed currency.
Converted prices do not take into account any overseas transaction fees your bank or credit card company may levy on such a purchase.
Currency Converter - Legal Disclaimer
While all care has been taken in making available and maintaining the Currency Conversion Rates displayed on this site, such conversion rates are estimates only of currency conversions that may apply to a transaction. These rates are provided for information purposes only without express or implied warranty.
The Currency Conversion Rates should not be relied upon as actual currency conversion rates that may be applied to any particular transaction as such rates will frequently fluctuate over time and vary between various financial providers.
Regulations
The Waste Electrical or Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive Compliance
Waste Battery Regulation
Under the Waste Battery Regulations, TemptationGifts.com are now offering a take back scheme for all portable waste batteries if you return them to our head offices in person. PLEASE DO NOT POST. Alternatively, you can find your local waste portable battery recycling facility at
http://www.recyclenow.com
Most supermarkets and shops that sell batteries will have collection bins for used batteries, and some town halls, libraries or schools may also set up collection points. End-users may find stores in their local area more accessible.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Regulations
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive is now UK law. The legislation aims to make producers pay for the collection, treatment and recovery of waste electrical equipment. The regulations also mean that suppliers of equipment like high street shops and internet retailers must allow consumers to return their waste equipment free of charge. The amount of WEEE we throw away is increasing by around 5% each year, making it the fastest growing waste stream in the UK. Recycling reduces the environmental and health risks associated with sending electrical goods to landfill. We are obliged under these regulations to offer our customers free take-back of their WEEE on a like-for-like basis when they buy a new Electrical or Electronic product from us.
Customers must return their like-for-like WEEE item to us within 30 days of purchasing their new item. Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should be marked with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol and be disposed of separately from normal household waste.

Upon receipt of a valid order you will receive an email confirmation with an order number and details of the items that you have ordered. At TemptationGifts.com we aim to dispatch your goods within 24 hours, but at particularly busy periods this may take up to 72 hours. You will receive an email confirming the order has been dispatched. Orders received over the weekend (after midday on Friday) will be dispatched the following Monday.
Orders placed using Standard Delivery to UK mainland addresses are sent either by Second Class Royal Mail or with an overnight courier company. You should expect your order to arrive at the designated delivery address within 2 - 5 working days of dispatch.
For your convenience, Standard Delivery does not require a signature on delivery. So if you're not in when the delivery arrives, if there is somewhere safe and discreet for the parcel to be left, (for instance with the doorman of a block of flats, or within a covered porch with an unlocked door) the driver will leave it for you. If there is no appropriate location, the driver will leave a card or attempt to redeliver on a subsequent day. If you haven't received your order within 2-5 working days of dispatch, and haven't received a card advising of attempted delivery we would suggest you contact your local sorting office to see if they are holding your parcel for you to collect. To find the contact details for your local Royal Mail sorting office please call 08457 740 740.
Deliveries to Northern Ireland, the Scottish Highlands & Islands and the Channel Islands must be shipped via Royal Mail. See below for a full list of postcodes exempt from using our courier service. Please allow up to 5 working days after dispatch for delivery to these addresses.
*PLEASE NOTE: Some Personalised Gifts are excluded from our Free UK Delivery offer. These items are dispatched from a separate location and incur additional postage charges and so unfortunately we are not able to extend our Free UK Delivery offer to orders containing these products. Where items are excluded from Free UK Delivery, it is clearly indicated on the product and within the checkout process.
Shipping offers and discounts may be provided on individual products or product ranges, with the full details of any offers specified alongside the relevant products and ranges.
If you choose Premium Delivery (£4.99)

Orders placed using Premium Delivery to UK mainland addresses are sent by First Class Royal Mail or using an overnight courier company. You should expect your order to arrive at the designated delivery address within 1 - 3 working days of dispatch.
As with Standard Delivery, this service does not normally require a signature on delivery. If you are not in when the delivery arrives your parcel may be left in a safe location. If there is no appropriate location to leave the parcel, the driver will leave a card or attempt to redeliver on a subsequent day. If you haven't received your order within 1-3 working days of dispatch, and haven't received a card advising of attempted delivery we would suggest you contact your local sorting office to see if they are holding your parcel for you to collect. To find the contact details for your local Royal Mail sorting office please call 08457 740 740.

Please be aware during peak periods Courier orders may be delivered up to 8pm in the evening.
When you place your order you can request that the parcel be left with a neighbour or in a secure location by writing the relevant information in the 'Note to Customer Service' section after you have put in your address. This will be added to the delivery details for the courier, however please note if you advise that the parcel can be left somewhere you must be confident that it is a safe and secure location.
Please note that an email address and/or mobile phone number will be provided to our courier partners to allow you to receive notifications of the progress of your delivery and to give you the option of providing additional delivery instructions.

International Delivery
Upon receipt of a valid order you will receive an email confirmation with an order number and details of the items that you have ordered. At TemptationGifts.com we aim to dispatch your goods the same working day, or failing that the following working day, and you will receive an email confirming the order has been dispatched. Orders received over the weekend (after midday on Friday) will be dispatched the following Monday.
Standard International orders are sent using Royal Mail and their international partners. This is a very reliable service and you will receive your order within 10-14 working days from dispatch. If you have still not received your order within this time, we ask you to check at your local postal office in case the parcel has been left there if you were out when they attempted delivery. On rare occasions it might take slightly longer for a parcel to be delivered if there is a delay at customs.
If your order is dispatched using FedEx this will take 1-3 working days from the dispatch date and will require a signature on arrival. You can track your order online, please email the customer service department on customerservice@temptationgifts.com and they will be able to provide you with the tracking number you will need to track your order with FedEx.
We cannot be held responsible for any customs taxes and charges which you may be charged, please contact customs and excise for further details.

Extremely rarely, in the event of unusually heavy or oversized orders going to overseas destinations, our shipping tariffs will prove insufficient to cover our costs. In which case we will contact you and request that you pay a postage surcharge to equal our specific shipping costs for your order. Should you choose not to pay that surcharge we will refund your payment in full and cancel your order. Should we receive no reply to this request we will hold your order for seven days and then refund your payment in full and cancel your order.
Please note - orders to China must be sent via FedEx and must be below £100 in value
Due to strict import regulations, we are only able to send orders below £100 to China and its provinces unless an Importer Customs Registration code is provided. All orders must be sent via our FedEx service.
Please note - we cannot send orders to Russia, Ukraine or Indonesia
Due to a high incidence of orders being rejected by the Russian Customs Office, and the extremely high costs incurred by Temptation Gifts when trying to reclaim these parcels, we have been forced to suspend all services to the Russian Federation.
Unfortunately we have also been forced to remove Ukraine and Indonesia as a billing or delivery options due to the high occurrence of fraudulent transactions originating from addresses in these areas.
To our many valued customers from these countries, we can only apologise for any inconvenience. Obviously we regret the loss of your business with us, and we are sorry to have to disappoint you. We hope you understand.
International delivery - exemptions, taxes and surcharges
The customer takes responsibility for payment of all duties, taxes and customs charges pertaining to their order. Extremely rarely, in the event of unusually heavy or oversized orders going to overseas destinations, our shipping tariffs will prove insufficient to cover our costs. In which case we will contact you and request that you pay a postage surcharge to equal our specific shipping costs for your order. Should you choose not to pay that surcharge we will refund your payment in full and cancel your order. Should we receive no reply to this request we will hold your order for seven days and then refund your payment in full and cancel your order.
If the customer is unable to or refuses to accept a parcel (except where it is damaged or faulty), the customer will be responsible for any customs fees or delivery charges incurred by us. Any charges will be deducted from any goods refund.
Pre-Orders
Some products can be pre-ordered from our website before the stock is available in our warehouse. These items are clearly labelled throughout the website, along with our best estimate of when we will be in a position to dispatch the products based on information provided to us by our suppliers. Any non-pre-order items included in the same order will be dispatched using our normal delivery schedule, with pre-ordered items following in a separate delivery at the later estimated dispatch date.
When purchasing pre-order items, you will be charged at the point of ordering and we will aim to dispatch the items as soon as they become available to us. In the unlikely event that we are unable to meet our estimated dispatch date due to a delay in stock arriving to us or an unexpected shortage of stock from our suppliers, we will notify any customers immediately with that information.
Pre-orders are available for delivery to addresses in the United Kingdom only.
Back Orders
We invest a great deal of money in stockholding, warehousing and stock control software in order to stay in stock of all our products at all times, and to ensure that the website is always updated when a product goes out of stock. However unfortunately these systems are not perfect and subject to human error, so occasionally we get caught out and an item is shown as being in stock when in fact it is not. This happens most often when two people order the last remaining item in very quick succession virtually simultaneously.
If part of your order is not in stock at the time you place your order, our standard policy is to dispatch the order as fully as possible and to refund you the difference for any items we have not sent. For international orders this also includes a refund for any extra shipping charge generated by the value of the item(s) we have not sent. We believe that this policy gives us the best chance of providing the best customer service possible under the circumstances: returning our customers' money immediately and leaving it to them to make alternative arrangements here or elsewhere should they choose to do so.
Occasionally if we know an item will shortly be coming back into stock - or if a customer orders a very large quantity of stock which we have to source specially - we will hold the order until the stock is available. Under these circumstances we will contact the customer as quickly as possible to explain the situation and to confirm that a short delay will be acceptable. This contact will be made within three working days, or immediately in the case of Courier Delivery or FedEx orders. We will keep the customer informed on progress as we await delivery of the stock we need.
Personalised Gifts
TemptationGifts.com offers the option to customise and personalise many items available on the website. Information about what can be personalised is clearly indicated within the descriptions of these items, along with any other details about the individual product.
Personalised Gifts Delivery
Many Personalised gifts are excluded from our Free UK Delivery offer or any limited time delivery offers as they are packaged and dispatched from a separate location and so unfortunately we are not able to extend our offer to orders containing these products.
Personalised items may also take longer than our standard delivery times due to additional time need for the personalisation process. In some cases, Premium, Courier or International delivery may not be available.
All of this information will be clearly indicated on the affected items.
Photo upload functionality
Some Personalised gifts (notably Personalised Village candles) allow you to upload your own image to be used for customisation. As a part of the personalisation process, a temporary copy of the images used to compose the customisation is stored securely within our systems. These images are not shared with any third parties and remain your property at all times. All images are deleted from our systems after 30 days.
By uploading an image, you confirm that you have the express permission from the copyright owner to use the image and grant us permission to use the image to create your personalised item. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all the appropriate permissions. Temptation Gifts Ltd will not liable for any image uploaded by a customer that infringes any third party rights, and any costs incurred as result of any infringement will be passed on to you.
We reserve the right to refuse any order that we deem to be offensive or inappropriate.
Tax Charges
All prices shown include VAT at 20% where required by UK law, for the UK market.
Prices for overseas orders (outside the EU) do NOT include UK VAT at 20% but do include a 20% levy imposed by Temptation Gifts as a contribution to the additional costs of processing international orders.
Credit Card Security
Using Opayo (Sage Pay) for complete security
When shopping at TemptationGifts.com all credit card details are safe, because the payment pages we use are completely secure.

Returns Policy
This does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer. In the towns where we have our high street stores, the name Temptation Gifts is synonymous with smiling, friendly, helpful customer service.
We are always happy to see the customer's point of view and genuinely upset if a customer has any reason to feel unhappy or dissatisfied with the products or service they receive. The same philosophy underpins our website policies on returns and refunds.
We wish to be as fair and generous as it is possible to be, within some limits established to protect ourselves against online fraud or unscrupulous characters.
Please note: We are unable to accept returns or process refunds in any of our high street stores. Please contact our online customer service team directly if you have any problems or queries.
Returns of Personalised Gifts
Due to the personalised nature of these items, we are only able to accept returns or offer refunds if items are damaged or faulty.
Dissatisfaction caused by TemptationGifts
We do everything we can do to ensure we send you the gifts you require in perfect condition by the date you require them.
However, sometimes things can go wrong. If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of your order or customer service experience, and the problem is our fault or the fault of one of the companies we use to ship your order to you, we will take steps to resolve the problem entirely at our own expense.
See below for details.
Damaged goods - please inform us within 14 days
Please contact us by phone or email within 14 days of receipt of your order.
Failure to report a damaged item within 14 days will invalidate your right to any refund or replacement.
We will need you to explain clearly which item or items are damaged and we will refund the price you paid for the goods, or arrange for replacement goods to be sent to you. If our customer service team asks you to return the damaged goods to us, you can do so at our expense with a prepaid returns label available upon request.
We do not wish to cause further inconvenience and only require items to be returned within 30 days of our requesting their return, so you can drop the return into your local post office at your convenience.
Incorrect or missing goods - please inform us within 14 days
Please contact us by phone or email within 14 days of receipt of your order. Failure to report incorrectly sent goods or goods missing from your order within 14 days will invalidate your right to any refund or replacement.
If we have sent you the wrong goods, or if we have failed to send you goods you have paid for (without acknowledging the shortfall on your delivery note and issuing you with a refund), we will need you to explain clearly what you have received in error or what is missing. We will arrange to send out the correct goods straight away (or alternatively issue you with a refund) and ask you to return any goods you were sent in error.
We do not wish to cause further inconvenience and only require items to be returned within 30 days of our requesting their return, so you can drop the return into your local post office at your convenience.
Goods not as described - please inform us within 14 days
Please contact us by phone or email within 14 days of receipt of your order. Failure to report goods not as described within 14 days will invalidate your right to any refund or replacement. If when your goods arrive they are not as we have described them on the website, or if they do not match the photograph we are displaying online, you are of course entitled to a refund or a replacement.
We will need you to explain clearly what the problem is, and we will refund the price you paid for the goods or arrange for replacement goods to be sent to you. If our customer service team asks you to return the unwanted goods to us, you can do so at our expense with a prepaid returns label available upon request.
We do not wish to cause further inconvenience and only require items to be returned within 30 days of our requesting their return, so you can drop the return into your local post office at your convenience.
Faulty goods - please inform us within 90 days
If your item is faulty or develops a fault soon after purchase, please contact us by phone or email as soon as you notice the fault, and no later than 90 days after receipt of your goods. Since we have no way of knowing what treatment a product has received once it arrives with the customer, Temptation Gifts will not accept responsibility for goods after more than 90 days.
We will need you to explain clearly which item or items are faulty and we will refund the price you paid for the goods or arrange for replacement goods to be sent to you.

International orders
Please note that in the case of orders to international destinations it is our policy always to issue refunds, rather than sending replacement goods. Any refund will include a refund for any extra shipping charge generated by the value of the goods which you inform us are damaged, faulty, or which have not arrived.
Dissatisfaction caused by customer error or decision
If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of your order or customer service experience, but the issue can reasonably be seen to be partially your own responsibility, we still want to help. But we will ask you share with us the cost of putting right anything which may have gone wrong. See below for details.
Incorrect details - please inform us immediately
If upon placing your order you realise you have entered some details incorrectly, whether product, billing, contact or delivery details, please inform us straight away by email or telephone to minimize any disruption. If your order has not yet been processed, we can try to make changes and sort everything out for you.
However we seek to process all orders in the shortest possible timeframe so if you delay and we have already dispatched your order, you will be responsible for the cost of returns and redeliveries.
Unwanted or mis-ordered goods - please inform us within 14 days
Please contact us by phone or email within 14 days of receipt of your order.
Failure to report unwanted goods within 14 days will invalidate your right to any refund or replacement.
It may be that when the goods arrive you change your mind, or you realise you accidentally bought the wrong thing. That's OK. Please just get in touch and explain clearly which items you don't want. Our customer service team will ask you to return the unwanted goods to us at your own expense. Please ensure they are returned in perfect condition and packaged securely, because you will only be eligible for a refund once we have received the goods and confirmed they are in re-saleable condition.
Once we have confirmed satisfactory receipt we will refund you the price paid for the goods.
NB: For reason of hygiene we will not accept earrings or underwear returned for any reasons other than fault or damage.
Mis-entered delivery details
If you have entered delivery details incorrectly, we will help you arrange redelivery to the correct address at your own expense. If as a result of incorrect delivery details a parcel is returned to us by the Post Office or one of our courier firms, we can arrange redelivery to the correct address for payment of a further standard shipping charge.
Returning Goods
If you wish to return goods to us, or if you are asked to do so by our customer service team, you may use a prepaid returns label if authorised to do so by the Terms above or verbally or in writing by our customer service team. If you use this prepaid returns label without authorisation, we reserve the right to deduct the cost of return from any refund issued for returned goods.When you return goods to us, please enclose information pertaining to the return. The information we need is:
Your name and order number.
Written confirmation of what items you have returned
Written confirmation of the reason for your return
Written request for either refund or replacement as appropriate.
Please also tell us whether or not you have already contacted our customer service team regarding this return.
If this information is not enclosed with any return we will not be able to process your return efficiently and you may experience a considerable delay before you receive correspondence, replacement, or refund.
