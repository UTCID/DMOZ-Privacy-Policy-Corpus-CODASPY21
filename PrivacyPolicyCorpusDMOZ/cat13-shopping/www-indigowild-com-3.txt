Disputes
With respect to any dispute regarding this Website, all rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Missouri, without regard to principles of conflicts of law and as if the Terms and Conditions were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within Missouri. You consent to enter into binding arbitration as the sole remedy to any dispute. Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to the Website shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in Jackson County, Missouri, and you submit to the jurisdiction and proceedings thereof, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of our affiliates, partners or licensors or otherwise have a cause of action in equity, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction and you consent to jurisdiction and venue in any such court for such purposes.

Each party is responsible for its own fees of representation and defense, and will split (50-50) the cost for any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees as required. However, you will be responsible for all costs of filing and administrative and arbitrator fees if the arbitrator determines your complaint or relief sought is frivolous.

General
You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between us concerning your use of the Website, and supersede and govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the changes on the Website.

Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect our full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award or court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole. We will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, our original objectives and intent as reflected in the original provision.
These Terms and Conditions should be interpreted broadly and under the laws of the State of Missouri.
If any provision is void or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be stricken and the rest of the contract will remain in full effect.
You may not assign or transfer any rights under these Terms and Conditions, without the consent of Indigo Wild, LLC.  Assignment or transfer of any and all rights without the consent of Indigo Wild, LLC will be null.
