Lori:
Thank you ever so much for the Presidential Inaugural Invitation. I was moved because it means so very much to me. I was in Washington D.C. last year during the inauguration, however, I had been hoping to eventually obtain something this special (I even wrote to my Congressman and others). Again, thank you so much and may you have continued success in your business in the coming years.
W.M.
Lori & Steve:

Lori,
The poster arrived late yesterday afternoon. It is hanging on my wall, and it looks absolutely fantastic! I smile when I see the President staring down at me as I am sitting at my desk.
Thanks so much! Well done!
Best,

I appreciate everything - the speedy response, the customer service, and of course, the product itself. Often, I'm skeptical and think that online testimonials only post the positive feedback, or even make up feedback. I can tell from the service I received that not only were these testimonials legitimate (just like your products), but it is likely they are all so positive because I can't imagine you getting a negative review.
Thank you so much. It was a pleasure working with you. This is how customer service is supposed to look and it is so refreshing! I'll certainly be back to purchase additional gifts for my history-buff boyfriend in the future.

Thanks again,

Hi Lori & Team
I have purchased items from you over the years, since what I guess was your beginning days.
All items come perfect - they are what you say - I appreciate each purchase.
Is there a website where I can say “ Lori and her team are amazing as are the items I purchase”….or something similar.
If so, I’m happy to do that !!
All my best,
John W

Lori & Steve--
I want to say many, many thanks for the way you handled my Hoover item consignment. You listed it promptly, described it in a way that accurately explained its quality and value, and sold it quickly at a top price--far beyond my expectations.
I couldn't be happier and would recommend you highly to anyone who wants to consign items with Lori Ferber Collectibles.
Thanks again!

Lori: In this day and age where the post office is strained to the max, it is so nice to have a company that clearly values getting their product to their customers!
Thanks!
