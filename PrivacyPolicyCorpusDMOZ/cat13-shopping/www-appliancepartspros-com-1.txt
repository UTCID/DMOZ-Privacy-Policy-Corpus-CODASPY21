16. Dispute Resolution; Informal Resolution AND Formal Resolution By Arbitration/ Class Action Waiver
In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and AppliancePartsPros.com agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to use of AppliancePartsPros.com Websites or use of any AppliancePartsPros.com product (referred to as a “Claim”) will be resolved as follows:
INFORMAL RESOLUTION: You and AppliancePartsPros.com will first attempt to resolve any Claim informally. In the event that any dispute between AppliancePartsPros.com and you arises out of or relates to use of any AppliancePartsPros.com product, these Terms of Use, the applicability of these Terms of Use to the use of any AppliancePartsPros.com Website or applications or product, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms of Use, you and we agree to try to promptly resolve any such dispute informally. Please send a written notice describing the dispute to: legal@AppliancePartsPros.com
FORMAL RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER:
READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION.
You agree that any dispute, controversy or Claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, the applicability of these Terms of Use as to the use of any AppliancePartsPros.com Site, or the purchase of any AppliancePartsPros.com products from this Site, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms of Use, or the determination of the scope or applicability of Arbitration shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act.
If you and AppliancePartsPros.com cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim asserted by either party will be resolved only by binding Arbitration. By agreeing to Arbitration, both you and AppliancePartsPros.com understand and agree that all disputes shall be decided by an arbitrator and that you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes.
Instead of suing in court, both you and AppliancePartsPros.com each agree to settle disputes (except certain small claims) only by Arbitration.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The rules in Arbitration are different.
There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms of Use as a court would.
The Arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms of Use. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms of Use, the rules set forth in these Terms of Use will govern. You may, in Arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state. If you decide to initiate Arbitration, AppliancePartsPros.com agrees to pay the Arbitration initiation fee and any additional required deposit required by JAMS to initiate your Arbitration. You and AppliancePartsPros.com agree to pay the costs of the Arbitration proceeding provided however that if you are a consumer you shall not be required to pay more than $250.00 of the fees or such amount as the JAMS Rules may later prescribe. All other fees, such as attorneys’ fees and expenses of travel to the Arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The Arbitration will be held at a location in your home town area if possible, unless you and AppliancePartsPros.com both agree to another location or telephonic Arbitration.
To initiate Arbitration, you or AppliancePartsPros.com must do the following things:
Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.
Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to:
JAMS [to your local JAMS office] or to JAMS, 555 West Fifth Street (Gas Company Tower), 32nd Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90013.
Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Special Rules in the Arbitration Proceeding. (i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor AppliancePartsPros.com shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in Arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.
THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER.
Accordingly, you and AppliancePartsPros.com agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our Arbitration. A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitrations. Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all Claims under these Terms of Use, you may assert an individual Claim in small claims court in lieu of Arbitration.
17. Class Action Waiver
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
AppliancePartsPros.com and you agree that AppliancePartsPros.com and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims brought under these Terms of Use in connection with the Site or any AppliancePartsPros.com product will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. AppliancePartsPros.com and you further agree that AppliancePartsPros.com and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with the Site.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in Los Angeles County, California.
The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any parent or affiliated company of AppliancePartsPros.com to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.
18. Limited Time to File Claims:
You and AppliancePartsPros.com agree that any Claim arising out of your use of any AppliancePartsPros.com Website or application or claim regarding any AppliancePartsPros.com product will be asserted within one (1) year after the Claim arises, or such Claim will be barred.
SEE SECTION 19 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 18.
19. Exclusions and Limitations; Consumer Protection Notice:
If you are a consumer, the provisions in these Terms of Use are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of your State of residence.
If you are a New Jersey resident or otherwise have rights under New Jersey’s consumer protection laws, the terms of Sections 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, and 18 do not limit or waive your rights under New Jersey law and the provisions in these Terms of Use are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of the State of New Jersey.
