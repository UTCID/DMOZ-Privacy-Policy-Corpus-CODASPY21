made by VISA, MasterCard, American Express, DiscoverCard, PayPal (EFT),
Checks and Money Orders. Checks and Bank Drafts are held 10 Business
Days before we ship the Order. Due to new stricter Banking Guidelines
and Privacy Acts, all Checks will be held for 10 Business Days before an
Order ships due to the Banks inability to verify cleared payment. If
your Order requires a quick shipment we recommend you select Credit
Card, PayPal or Money Order as your payment method. Your card issuer
agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer
to that agreement and not this Terms of Use to determine your rights and
liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT BUYGOLFSHIRTS.COM, ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT
CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in
connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the
rates in effect when the charges were incurred. Unless you notify
BuyGolfShirts.com of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they
first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be
deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If BuyGolfShirts.com does not
receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to
pay all amounts due upon demand by BuyGolfShirts.com or its agents. You
are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your
purchases, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added
taxes. BuyGolfShirts.com shall automatically charge and withhold the
applicable sales tax for orders to be delivered to addresses
within Texas and any other states or localities that it deems is
required. Returned Check fee for Insufficient Funds (NFS) : $25.00
7. Order Acceptance Policy. Your receipt of an electronic or other form
of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor
does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. BuyGolfShirts.com
reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or
decline your order for any reason. BuyGolfShirts.com further reserves
the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to
you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your
order will be deemed accepted by BuyGolfShirts.com upon our shipment of
products or delivery of services that you have ordered. All orders
placed over $1000.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable
method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance
department. We may require additional verifications or information
before accepting any order.
8. No Responsibility To Sell Mispriced Products Or
Services. BuyGolfShirts.com shall have the right to refuse or cancel any
orders placed for products and/or services listed at an incorrect price,
rebate or refund, or containing any other incorrect information or
typographical errors. BuyGolfShirts.com shall have the right to refuse
or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed
and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been
charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, BuyGolfShirts.com
shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the
amount of the charge.
9. Modifications to Prices or Billing Terms. BUYGOLFSHIRTS.COM RESERVES
THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE ITS PRICES AND BILLING METHODS FOR
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING ON THE
SITE OR BY E-MAIL DELIVERY TO YOU.
10. Price Comparisons, "List
Price" and "You Save". Price comparisons may be made throughout the site
to indicate the relative savings amounts of our pricing. "LIST PRICE" is
the suggested retail price provided to us by our suppliers. We make no
representation that a substantial number of these products have been
sold or offered for sale at the list price. Actual retail prices in your
area may be substantially different. Because we sell our merchandise
over the internet on a national basis, it is not possible to know if our
merchandise is sold at list price in any particular location or at any
particular time. "YOU SAVE"reflects the difference between our price and
the supplier provided list price shown on our sites. Because the list
price may be different than the actual retail prices in your area, you
may not actually realize a savings of this amount and may want to make
an exact comparison for yourself by checking the prices of other
internet or local retailers prior to making a purchase.
11. Order Processing and Shipping Times. Most all Orders are processed
within 15 minutes of receipt during normal business hours. For this
reason, we are unable to make changes to your order once it has been
submitted via our website or by phone in most all cases. Please review
your Order carefully before submitting. We do not guarantee Same Day
Shipping, but most Orders that are placed by 1pm CST do ship the same
day. Some Premium Brands including, but not limited to, Tommy Hilfiger,
Tehama, Antigua, Dunbrooke, Page & Tuttle, Munsingwear, Pro Celebrity,
Callaway Golf, Ashworth, Van Heusen and some Jockey styles are excluded
from Same Day Shipping. These brands will ship within 1-3 Business Days
as noted on each of their product pages. Please choose your Shipping
Method accordingly when ordering these or any Premium Brands. Shipping
times are on each product page.
12. Images, Dyes, Fabrics, Weights and Content. Every effort is made to
insure that pictured fabric colors in our catalog and on our website are
as close as possible to the actual fabric color. This cannot be
guaranteed and an actual color sample should be purchased when exact
color match is required. Since most monitors are never calibrated the
colors you see on your monitor may differ from what others see on their
monitor and from the actual color of the apparel in the picture. Shade
variations are inherent in the garment dyeing process.Garment-Dyed goods
should be washed separately before wearing. Do not dry clean. Published
fabric weights are an average weight among neutrals, lights, darks and
premiums.Ash/Heather colored products are not 100% cotton and must carry
a small percentage of polyester to achieve the color.
13. Embroidery,
Screenprinting or other embellished products. In certain instances you
may receive an overage or a shortage on your embellished order. Due to
manufacturing quality and production standards there will be over runs
and occasionally under runs. BuyGolfShirts.com will do everything
possible to reduce this occurrence. The industry standard on most
products is +/- 5%. For instance, if you order 1,000 custom printed mugs
you could potentially receive between 950 and 1,050 custom printed mugs.
Exceptions to the above are paper and plastic bags, which may vary +/-
25%. We will bill either your account or credit card only for the actual
quantity shipped. There will be a $25 Cancellation Fee on any cancelled
embroidery, screenprinting or other embellished products. Any returned
items will be subject to restocking fees as outlined in our Return
Terms. If you have any questions please contact us at either
1-866-727-6567.
14. Shipping Terms and
Liability. This merchandise becomes your property at the time it is
accepted by the carrier. The carrier will be UPS Groundsaver, unless
otherwise specified on your order. UPS cannot deliver to a P.O.
Box. Delivery address must be a physical street address. Most all
approved orders placed before 1pm CST will be shipped the same day FOB
from our warehouses. Orders received after 1pm CST and Orders which
consist of Premium Brands which do not offer Same Day Shipping will be
shipped the following business day or within the time frame noted on the
products ordering page. BuyGolfShirts.com shall not be liable for any
delay in the delivery or shipment of goods, or for any damages suffered
by reason of such delay. BuyGolfShirts.com also reserves the right to
modify the shipment cut-off times and to select alternative carriers.
BuyGolfShirts.com is not responsible for discrepancies on orders
received by parties other than the billed customer. We ship only to
locations within the 50 United States. We do not accept requests for
delivery at specific times of day. For residential deliveries, if the
recipient is not available at the time of delivery, the delivery person
may leave the gift in a safe place for the recipient to retrieve when
they return or attempt delivery the next day. During the holidays
deliveries may be made as late as 9pm. For business deliveries, if the
business is closed or not accepting deliveries, delivery will be
attempted the next business day. During the holidays deliveries may be
made as late as 5pm. BuyGolfShirts.com cannot be held responsible for
lost or delayed orders after shipments leave our warehouse.Delivery of
any shipment by us to a carrier relieves us of all further
responsibility for damage and / or shortage. If you have a concealed
shortage or damage you must notify carrier to inspect within 7 days of
receipt of shipment. Any claim for damage or shortage must be filed in
writing with the carrier. Claims must be filed within the carriers
specified time frame of receipt of shipment. At your request, if you
will send the carrier's written report of their inspection, we will help
you in filing your claim.
- Commercial Address : Signature required for all packages.
- Residential Address : We ship with "No Signature Required" by
default. But some UPS drivers take it upon themselves to decide whether
or not to leave a package without obtaining a signature. This is beyond
our control. BuyGolfShirts.com cannot be held responsible for lost
shipments in which the carrier does not require a signature for delivery
(either by choice, designation or waiver of signature on file for the
ship to address) and leaves package(s) unattended at the ship to
address. BuyGolfShirts.com will assist in filing a claim.
- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Customer assumes all risk when requesting 'No
signature required,' and-or deliveries to unsecured special locations,
e.g., 'Leave at back door,' 'Leave at manager's desk,' etc. We can only
provide this special location if room allows in the address
field. BuyGolfShirts.com cannot guarantee that your special location
will be included with your delivery address. Customer must designate at
Check Out the proper 'Ship to' receiver, and-or business name and
address to which delivery is to be made. Failure to provide accurate
receiver data may result in a delayed or failed delivery and subsequent
UPS return of order to vendor, in which case additional shipping fees
will be charged off-line to the credit card of record for reshipment of
order. If a reshipment is not desired on an order in which accurate
receiver data was not provided by the customer, shipping charges will
not be refunded. Please note, our warehouses do not ship on weekends and
we do not offer weekend or holiday delivery. Tracking information
provided when available, usually within 24-48 hours or upon
request. Order shipping directly from a Mill will require additional
time for tracking information upon request. Tracking is not possible for
APO/FPO Shipments due to USPS limitations.
15. APO / FPO SHIPMENT TERMS. To ship to an APO/FPO address our
warehouses (who ship via UPS only, excluding warehouse 2 & 3) must ship
your order to our Houston offices and repackage the order for USPS
shipping then physically carry the package(s) to the USPS clerk. This is
why our rates to APO/FPO are higher. APO/FPO Orders are actually
shipping twice. Once via UPS Ground to our Offices, then reshipped via
USPS Mail to your APO/FPO address. Please select APO/FPO Military
Address as your shipping method. The rate shown is the same amount as
shipping UPS Ground to our Office plus shipping Priority Mail Insured to
an APO/FPO address 90% of the time. In most cases we will absorb some,
if not all of the actual shipping cost over the amount shown on your
bill. In rare cases, some APO/FPO Orders may incur additional shipping
charges which we are unable to determine until after an order has been
placed. You will be notified via email if your order requires additional
shipping charges. Any additional shipping charges must be approved by
the customer prior to shipment. If approval for additional shipping
charges is not granted within 48 hours the order will either be shipped
at the lower rated USPS Parcel Post method or the order will be placed
on hold for 7 days, at which time it will be cancelled. You will be
notified in either instance. There is no tracking option available for
APO/FPO shipments. WE VERIFY ALL APO/FPO ZIP CODES. Any attempt to ship
to a United States Post Office Box will be reported to the proper
authorities. Your IP address is revealed when placing an Order on our
website. We will do our best to make this a smooth process when shipping
to APO/FPO addresses. We are aware that military personnel are not able
to check their email as often as others and we will do our best to
handle things on our end without further correspondence from our
military customers. We apologize for the inconvenience, however this is
the only method available to us at this time to ship to APO/FPO
addresses.
16. SPAM POLICY. Unsolicited Commercial Email is a FEDERAL CRIME.*
Presence of our email addresses on our site does not invite Unsolicited
Commercial Email (UCE or SPAM). Copies of all UCE that we
receive are forwarded to our Federal and State lawmakers and to the
Federal Trade Commission for possible criminal prosecution. Pursuant to
US Code, Title 47, Chapter 5, Subchapter II, 227 [47 USC 227], any and

Internet should be restricted because of the unethical and illegal acts
of a small minority of Internet citizens, please (a) contact your

if they have not already done so; (b) contact your state and Federal
