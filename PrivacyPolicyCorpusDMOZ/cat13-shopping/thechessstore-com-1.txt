PRIVACY AT THE CHESS STORE
We live in the same world as you, and don't like it either when say...you subscribe to a magazine for "free" and all of a sudden your junk mail for "related offers" rolls in ten fold. It's also about the worst thing in the world when you sign up for a "contest" or other event, and supply a phone number...only to be added to every other call center's list to be pummeled and pestered for the rest of your days.
You can rest assured that The Chess Store will never, ever share your information on any "spam" level with anyone.
Your address is used to verify your payment method, and used for shipment info
Your phone number is used to verify payment method, and for us to contact you in case of a problem
Your email address is used to confirm your order status and provide tracking information
We do not stalk you on the phone because you placed an order, no sales calls or solicitations ever.
By joining our mailing list via the home page or during checkout, you agree to receive periodic yet meaningful email contacts from us and us alone. Our mailers aren't very frequent, they're not cluttered up impossible to read flyers with exclamation points all over the place. Our email subscribers enjoy real information in a concise effort to keep you informed of specials, new products and other generally good info we have to share.
We couldn't rest easy any other way.
If you still have questions, feel free to contact us concerning privacy or other issues.
