Targeted Advertising
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve targeted advertisements on our behalf. These companies may use cookies or other technologies (such as a 1×1 pixel .gif file, also known as a web beacon) collected from your visits to ConstructionBooks.net and other third party websites to:
tailor advertisements you see on third party websites and social media (including Facebook) to deliver adverts more relevant to you;

The following social media sites require you to select your interest-based advertising preferences directly on their websites: Facebook and Twitter. We suggest you also regularly review your privacy and advertising settings within all of your social media accounts.
We use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry or adding an item to their basket. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google Search Results Page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to our site. Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own Privacy Policy and Google's Privacy Policy. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customise Google Display Network ads using Google's Ad Settings page. Users can completely block Google Analytics tracking using Google's Opt-out browser add-on.
Storage and Security
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. All interactions with the ConstructionBooks.net website, including payment transactions, will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers; this includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
By using our site, you acknowledge and consent to the potential transfer, processing and storage outside of the EEA. You should be aware that many countries outside the EEA do not afford the same legal protections to Personal Information as countries within the EEA. Transfers will be made in accordance with the applicable legislation and we will take reasonable and necessary measures (so far as it is within our control to do so) to ensure that third parties involved will provide an adequate level of protection.
