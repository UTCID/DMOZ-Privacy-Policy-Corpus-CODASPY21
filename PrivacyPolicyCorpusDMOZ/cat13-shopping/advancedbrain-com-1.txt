ABT is not responsible for any data charges by your Internet service provider or telephone company.
9. THIRD PARTY SITES
The Site may contain links to websites provided or operated by parties other than ABT. When you visit any such websites, you do so at your own risk. ABT undertakes no obligation to monitor such websites and is not responsible for any damage, loss of privacy, or offensive material you may encounter as you navigate away from the Site. You should consult the user agreements and privacy and security policies of any such websites you visit.
10. MONITORING THE SERVICE
ABT has no obligation to monitor the Service. However, ABT may do so and disclose information regarding use of the Service for any reason, as long as ABT adheres to the Privacy Policy and believes, in its sole discretion, that it is reasonable to do so, including to: satisfy laws, regulations, or governmental or legal requests; operate the Service properly; and protect ABT or its Users. ABT may immediately remove your personal information from its servers, in whole or in part, if ABT, in its sole discretion, determines that the information infringes another’s property rights.
11. FORUMS
You acknowledge that the Forums on this Site are offered for interaction among Users only, and you use them at your own risk. You assume the risk of encountering any harassing, disparaging, offensive, or obscene material in the Forums, and will promptly report any such material to ABT. Communications posted in any Forum are not intended to represent the views of ABT. Any advice you may receive from the Forum represent the User’s opinion and is not necessarily the opinion of ABT. No User is authorized to represent ABT in any dealings with other Members, or to make any warranties regarding any products or services offered by ABT. Any communications between Users must conform to the standards set forth in this Agreement. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to waive any claim against any User arising out of any communication or advice offered by another User. You also agree to waive any claim against ABT arising out of any communication, advice, or conduct of any User, on the Site or otherwise. ABT may decline to allow you to participate in any Forum, and may terminate your participation at any time in its sole discretion.
12. CHARGES AND BILLING
Any Paid Service must be pre-paid. Payment for Paid Service is due on the day of Enrollment or the first day after the expiration of any free trial period, whichever occurs later; and thereafter on the first day after the end of each billing cycle. Billing cycles vary depending on the type of payment plan a Subscriber selects. Payment for Paid Service grants access to Subscribers to utilize the Service 24/7. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR BY EXPRESS NOTIFICATION FROM ABT TO THE CONTRARY, PAYMENT FOR PAID SERVICE-WHETHER USED OR UNUSED-IS NON-REFUNDABLE.
Most Subscribers pay by credit card. If you don’t have a credit card, you may authorize ABT to make electronic fund transfers from your checking account. By selecting this billing option and providing ABT with your checking account information, you authorize ABT to debit your checking account for Paid Service fees and other applicable charges. If your financial institution declines your payment, you agree to pay ABT a $25.00 NSF or closed account fee for every such occurrence – in addition to any fee your financial institution may charge.
WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR DESIGNATED CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT EVERY BILLING CYCLE UNLESS YOU CANCEL THE SERVICE USING THE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT. BY CONTINUING TO SUBSCRIBE TO PAID SERVICE, YOU RE-AFFIRM THAT ABT IS AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT APPLICABLE FEES BY CHARGING YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBITING YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE SELECTED. NONUSE OF OR NON-PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE CANCELLATION OF THE SERVICE, NOR DOES IT REMOVE YOUR ONGOING OBLIGATION TO PAY APPLICABLE SERVICE FEES.
ABT is not responsible for any charges or expenses (such as for overdrawn accounts or exceeding credit or debit card limits) resulting from charges billed by ABT. YOU AGREE TO MAINTAIN VALID AND CURRENT CREDIT CARD, DEBIT CARD, OR CHECKING ACCOUNT INFORMATION ON FILE WITH ABT DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR ONE YEAR THEREAFTER.
13. CHANGES IN FEES OR BILLING METHODS
ABT reserves the right to change its fees or billing methods at any time. If you don’t like the changes in fees or billing methods, you may cancel the Service at any time subject to the cancellation provisions outlined in this Agreement. ABT also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of Service.
14. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL
NO MATTER WHICH PAYMENT PLAN YOU SELECT, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF THE PLAN’S TERM AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR CHECKING ACCOUNT WILL BE CHARGED, UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE PLAN’S TERM FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT. .
15. DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING DISPUTES
We expect you to pay your account balance on time. Delinquent accounts may be suspended or canceled at ABT’s sole discretion; however, charges will continue to accrue until the Service is properly canceled. ABT may impose an additional charge to reinstate suspended or canceled Service. ABT will assess an additional 1.5% per month late charge (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower, with a minimum charge of $1.00) if your payment is 30 days past due. That amount is due immediately upon assessment. You are liable for any costs, including attorney and collection fees, ABT may incur in collecting any balance from you. IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS CANCELLED, YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR AND WILL PAY ANY OUTSTANDING BALANCE, INCLUDING ANY ONGOING SUBSCRIPTION FEES THROUGH THE END OF YOUR PLAN’S TERM. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE ANY BILLING PROBLEM OR DISCREPANCY UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US OF THE PROBLEM IN WRITING AT: ABT, 5748 SOUTH ADAMS PARKWAY, OGDEN, UTAH 84405, WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER (A) AN INDICATION OF THE PROBLEM FIRST APPEARS ON YOUR BANK OR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT, OR (B) YOU RECEIVE THE DISPUTED INVOICE OR STATEMENT FROM ABT, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.
16. TERMINATION AND CANCELLATION
Either you or ABT may terminate or cancel your account at any time. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE CANCELLATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT IS YOUR SOLE RIGHT AND REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE WITH ABT. This includes any dispute related to, or arising out of: (a) any term of this Agreement or the enforcement or application of this Agreement; (b) any policy or practice of ABT, including the Privacy Policy and ABT’s security practices, or the enforcement or application of these policies or practices; (c) your ability to access or use the Service; and (d) the amount or type of, or changes to, fees, surcharges, applicable taxes, or billing methods. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive termination, including Sections 14 through 20, will remain in force and continue to be binding on you if your account is terminated or cancelled for any reason.
YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO THE PROCESS PROVIDED WITHIN THE PRODUCT. CANCELLATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS AFTER THE CANCELLATION REQUEST IS PROPERLY DELIVERED. ABT will process your cancellation request and send you e-mail confirmation of the cancellation.
