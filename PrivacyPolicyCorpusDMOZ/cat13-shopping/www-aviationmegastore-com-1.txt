Section 8. Product Disclaimer
Section 8a. General Products Disclaimer
The laws of certain jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or conditions or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to the customer, some or all of the following disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations might not apply and the customer might have additional rights.
The Company's services and all information content, materials, products (including software) and other services included on or otherwise made available to you though Luchtvaart Hobby Shop or Aviation Megastore are provided by the Company on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis, unless otherwise specified in writing. The Company makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of Luchtvaart Hobby Shop or Aviation Megastore services or the information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to the customer through Luchtvaart Hobby Shop or Aviation Megastore, unless otherwise specified in writing. Customer expressly agree that the use of the Company's services and products is at customer's sole risk.
To the full extent possible permissible by applicable law, the Company disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of title, merchantable quality and fitness for a particular purpose. The Company does not warrant that the Company's services, information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included or otherwise made available to the customer through the Company's services, its servers, electronic communications, or e-mail sent from Luchtvaart Hobby Shop or Aviation Megastore are free of viruses or other harmful components.

Section 8b. Collector's Models Disclaimer
Collector's models differ from modelling kits in that they contain finished fuselage, airfoiles, undercarriages or armament. Depending on brand these collector's models are offered as 'push-to-fit' or already assembled by the manufacturer. In the latter case parts may disassemble during transportation. This can easily be corrected by re-inserting the applicable part in its proper place, possibly assisted by the application of a tiny bit of superglue. It is not considered reason for complaint or compensation. Any refund will be restricted to the price of the model if returned within 7 days from delivery.
The majority of display models are hand made. While quality is guaranteed, it must be taken in account that minor imperfections will always be part of their nature. Display models can be subjected to extensive examination in the Luchtvaart Hobby Shop. Customers, who order these models via Aviation Megastore websites, accept the presence of minor imperfections (*) and will not be eligible for refund.

In certain cases, the purposes for which the personal data are requested are evident, such as the provision of name, address and payment details as part of the ordering process, and customer consent with the collection of these data is assumed. Name, address, telephone number and e-mail address are provided to delivery services that the Company uses to deliver goods. These delivery services are obliged to use this information exclusively for the delivery of goods to the customer and not to disclose to third parties. In case of delivery of goods to residents of countries whose authority requires data to be provided for import and levies, an invoice and, where appropriate, personal data intended for that purpose will also be provided to the delivery service.· Account or customer account: Every customer of the Company has its own account in which the following personal data are stored: name and address details, telephone number and e-mail address (= user name), newsletter subscription, invoices from previous orders. Customers are entitled to inspect, adapt and delete the stored personal data. This can be done by processing data in the customer account on the websites or by request by e-mail or other means of communication.· Consent: Knowledge and consent are required for the storage, use or disclosure of personal data, unless legally required or permitted. The provision of personal information to the Company is always the customer's choice. However, the customer's decision not to provide certain information may limit the ability of the Company to deliver products or services to the customer.
