SUBMISSIONS
CL is pleased to hear from its customers and welcomes your comments regarding CL products and services, including this Site. Unfortunately, however, CL's long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas (including operating ideas, designs, and original artwork, etc.), suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested (see below). While we value your feedback, we request that you be specific in your comments regarding our services and products, and that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials. It is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by CL's professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.
If, at our request, you send or post (i.e., via contests) certain specific submissions, or, despite our request that you not send us any creative ideas, suggestions or other materials, you do so anyway (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the exclusive property of CL. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of CL, and CL shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, CL shall exclusively own the copyright and all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the world, and CL shall be entitled to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, license, create derivative works from and distribute such materials or incorporate such Submissions into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to those who provide the Submissions. In addition, you warrant that your Submissions do not violate any person's so-called "moral rights" or other similar or analogous rights under any applicable laws in any country or region of the world. Applicable law may restrict or limit the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. If so, without limitation of the foregoing, you agree that, in no event, shall CL's total liability exceed five hundred dollars ($500.0).
You agree to indemnify CL for any and all claims, damages, losses, and causes of action arising as a result of your Submissions or your failure to comply with the Terms of Service.
Please refer to the GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE SERVICES below for additional information concerning Submissions.
