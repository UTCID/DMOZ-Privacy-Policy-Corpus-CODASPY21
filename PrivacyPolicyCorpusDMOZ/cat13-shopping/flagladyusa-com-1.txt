Did You Know?
The American Flag is the backbone of our company. Our founder, Mary Leavitt The Flag Lady - started selling the American Flag out of the trunk of her car during the Iranian crisis.
Now 34 years later, our family owned & operated business has grown into one of the largest flag dealers in the country. We have been blessed and we thank you for all of your support!
