How to Measure Blinds
Whether you're a passionate perfectionist or seeking a stress-free solution, we've got the tips you need to measure your windows correctly.
Ready for a surprisingly painless method of getting your windows measured correctly? Follow these three easy steps to get started with the perfect measurements:
Always use a steel measuring tape to record your window sizes. They're more accurate and easier to control.
Choose an Inside Mount or Outside Mount window treatment. Inside Mounts fit inside your window frame and look sleek and clean. Outside Mounts are installed above and around your window frame, which can make your windows look bigger.
Measure each window in three places: across the top, middle, and bottom. Use the lowest measurement as the size for your window.
