Shipping Methods
House of Staunton proudly offers a variety of shipping methods from Fedex and the US Postal Service (USPS).Depending on the item/s being purchased and the delivery address, not all delivery options will be available to all customers. The rates quoted by our website reflect theactual shipping charge being quoted by that carrier for that particular method of delivery. In other words, that is what it will cost us to ship the package to the address that was provided. As such, we can not offer any shipping discounts beyond what is quoted on our website.
International Shipping
We are proud to ship to customers in many countries around the globe. All orders shipped internationally will be shipped via FedEx International Economy or FedEx International Priority. Please note that the arrival times listed on the U.S. web site apply to U.S. shipping addresses only.

When your order arrives at customs either our shipper, FedEx, or the customs office will contact you directly to arrange for the payment of any charges that may be due.
Fedex International Shipping
House of Staunton is proud to announce that our Fedex International Rates reflect a discount of upwards of 70% off the Fedex Standard International Shipping Rates. Fedex has graciously offered us a very generous discount package, and we in turn pass those shipping savings on to our customers.
Media Mail
House of Staunton proudly offers Media Mail shipping, a very cost-effective way to send DVDs, Books and Software via the US Postal Service. Please note that because the US Postal Service has significant restrictions on what can, and what can't be sent via Media Mail, we can only offer this option on orders where ALL of the items being ordered qualify as Media Mail.
If you purchase even one item that does not qualify for Media Mail, such as a chess clock or a chess set, your order will not be Media Mail qualiified and the website will not offer it as a shipping option. We re sorry, but Media Mail is only available to customers living in the United States.

Sales Tax is excluded for every state with the exception of residents in Alabama. Standard Rates Apply.
Returns and Exchanges
All returns and exchanges will void free shipping and will be charged standard shipping rates.

R.H. from NY writes, "The chess set came yesterday and it is so beautiful!!!!! It was a dreary dismal day here, cold and rainy and receiving the set made it feel like the sun had come out."

R.G. from Alaska writes, "I have just received my order of Professional Series chess pieces. I must say that they are gorgeous! I felt I was treated as if one of the family in the way the order was taken and delivered. I'm a very happy customer!"
D.O. from NJ writes, "The chess set and chess board are incredible. The pictures looked great, but they don't do this set justice. I can't believe there is a finer classic Staunton chess set out there."
B.O. from CO writes, "I am writing to you to express my deep satisfaction with the House of Staunton chess set I received from my wife as a 40th birthday gift. It is truly beautiful. Thanks"
G.M. from MS writes, "I received the Rosewood Players chess set today and all I can say is... outstanding! It is a magnificent set. I couldn't ask for a better chess set, it puts my set from the USCF I got in the 80's to shame."
P.M. from OK writes, "The chess set I ordered from you came in mint condition, expertly wrapped and it is a work of art. It is rare to find items crafted so well and I will certainly recommend The House of Staunton to others."

L.L. from NV writes, "I cannot begin to tell you how pleased I am with the chess set which arrived today. It's so exquisite, I can't stop looking at it. Though the pictures on your website are beautiful, they don't do justice to actually seeing them in person."
L.L. from AZ writes, "This chess set exceeded all my expectations. I've been looking for a red-lacquered chess set for quite sometime, and this is the most beautiful I've ever seen. Thank you, also, for meticulously wrapping each piece."
R.A. from AZ writes, "I can honestly say that all things considered your chess sets are better than Jaques, because you provide the same if not better quality, but at a price that is much easier to bear."
F.B. from UT writes, "Thanks so much! My brother is going to love his first real chess set. You are the best. But you know that already. Keep me in the loop on how you plan to overtake all the crap plastic sets out there."
R.F. from WY writes, "Just a note to thank you for the beautiful chess set I received, and the great(!) service that your business delivers. You were very patient and accommodating during my selection process. Now if I could only learn how to win a game..."
B.F. from Idaho writes,"My plastic Collectors chess set arrived today, and I must tell you, Yes, to me it IS well worth what I paid for it. It is massive, heavy, elegant and high-class. A true work of art."
A.S. from ND writes, "I just received my Plastic Collector's set and it's every bit as impressive as I had expected it to be. Not only is it the finest plastic chess set I've ever seen, but the biggest bargain, as well. That's a rare combination."
H.O. from ND writes, "Received my beautiful ebonized Winsor chess set today. It is awesome. A work of art I will treasure & play with. I can't wait to save up enough for my House of Staunton chess board."
J.E. from SD writes, "I recieved my chess set yesterday, I could not be happier. The quality is above what I expected. I would like to own a Jaques set someday but until then I will be perfectly happy with my Reykjavik II Chess Set."
M.M. from KS writes, "I received the chess set today! I can only say that the photos on your web site do no justice to the Collector Series chess pieces. I hand waxed them as you instructed, and they are truly exceptional."
B.B. from OK writes, "Thanks again, the chessmen and the chess board both got much praise when I took them to work today. Everyone was as impressed as I was, with the beauty and quality of both my chess board and the wonderful chessmen."
