If you wish to ship to an address that is not your billing address, you can contact your card’s issuing bank and have your shipping destination added as an authorized alternate ship-to address on your account or on the memo field. We will contact your card issuer to verify this information after you've placed an order. Please allow an extra day to verify any alternate ship-to address.
Both your billing and shipping addresses must be verified before an order will ship. If you encounter any trouble when attempting to add an alternate shipping address, let the card issuer know that you are placing an online order and that the retailer must verify your personal information before shipment to eliminate the possibility of fraud. Then, simply give us a call at (888) 678-2735 to let us know and we will re-attempt address verification to complete the processing of your order.
