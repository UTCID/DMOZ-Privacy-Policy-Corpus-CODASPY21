Privacy Policy
Our basic privacy policy is simple: We will not sell your personal information to any other company.
Additional Details About Our Privacy Policy
Collection of Information
When you browse our website, you do so anonymously. We do not collect or track any personally identifiable information about you when
you browse our site.
The only personal information we collect is the information you voluntarily submit when placing an order. We request
only the information we need in order to process your order, charge your credit card, and contact you in case of any questions about your
order. From time to time we survey our customers to ensure we're delivering the best service. Any personal information from these surveys
is never sold or provided to other companies. Any personal information you share with us will stay with us.
Use of Information
We use the information you provide to process your order, charge your credit card, and communicate with you about your order.
We may send you e-mail notifications of sales or special offers from our company or affiliated companies. If you would prefer not
to receive email notification of future sales, new products, recipes or discounts, or other offers please
email us at cs@metrokitchen.com to opt out of our email list.
Disclosure of Information
We will never sell your personal information to any other company. Naturally, in order to process
your credit card charge, we must submit your name, card number, expiration date, billing address, and the dollar amount of the charge
to our credit card processing bank, like any other retailer which accepts credit cards as payment.
Information Stored on our Web Server
Unlike many other online retailers, we do not store any personal information about you on our web server. None of your personal
information, such as your name, address, phone number, or credit card number, is stored online. We know it's a bit inconvenient for
our valued customers not to be able to "log in," but the privacy and security of all of our customers is a top concern. The advantage
of this policy is that your name, address, credit card number, and other personal information can never be stolen from our web server,
because it is not stored there.
