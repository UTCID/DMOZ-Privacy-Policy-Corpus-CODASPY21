Shipping
We offer free shipping on all orders over $49.00 if the order is shipping within the Contiguous United States.
All orders eligible for free shipping will be shipped by the carrier of our choice. If you choose the free shipping option, you must provide us with a physical address. We will not ship to a PO Box. If you do not have a physical address, free shipping is not an option for you. If we receive your order with free shipping chosen, and you did not supply a physical address, the order will be put on hold until we resolve the issue with you.
If you require shipping to a P.O box, you must pay for and choose USPS as the shipping option during checkout.
If you wish to have control over the shipping method or require a specific carrier, you must pay for shipping by that carrier during checkout.
Please note, orders $500 and greater require a signature upon delivery, this is to prevent stolen packages and is at no additional cost to you, the customer.
Canadian Shipping
The customer is responsible for any customs, brokerage, or other fees that may be incurred as a result of the merchandise crossing the Canadian border. Please check with your local government before ordering so you are aware of what, if any, additional charges there may be to you. Merchandise refused or returned for any reason from an order shipped to Canada will incur a 20% restocking fee that will be deducted from the total amount refunded. For more details check out our Shipping a Berkey to Canada page.
Expedited Shipping
We offer expedited shipping methods through UPS (Next Day Air, Second Day Air and 3rd Day Select). Orders for this expedited service placed before 12:00 pm (noon) MST on a regular business day (M-F), will be shipped that day. Orders placed after this time will be shipped the next day unless that day is a holiday or weekend, then it would ship the next available business day. UPS does not deliver on Saturday, Sunday, or Holidays. Under certain rare circumstances that are sometimes beyond our control, we may not be able to get orders out for Next Day Air Service. Under these rare circumstances, we will contact you for further instructions and directions on how to proceed.
Order Cancellations/Changes
We make every effort to ship orders as soon as possible. For this reason, order cancellations or changes are not possible. For further information, you may contact our Customer Service Center.
Undeliverable or Refused Packages
Undeliverable or refused packages returned to us will incur a $17 return fee imposed by the carrier and up to a 20% handling fee. These fees will be deducted from the amount refunded
Missing or Damaged Items
It is the responsibility of the customer to inspect their order once it is received. If you find items to be missing or damaged, you must notify us within 10 days of receiving your order to be eligible for replacement. Claims of missing items or damaged items after 10 days of receiving your package will not be approved.
For damaged items, sent an email to Customerservice@berkeyfilters.com with the following details.
1. Subject line of email: Damaged Item
2. Provide a detailed message documenting the damage. Lack of detail may delay the processing of your claim if we need further information.
3. Attach a photo of the item clearly showing the damage.
4. Attach a photo of the damage to the shipping box, if applicable.
Approved claims for missing or damaged items will be processed in 24-48 business hours of being received.
We will cover the cost of ground shipping both ways when returning damaged items or shipping replacements - if the customer's physical address is within the contiguous 48.
100% Satisfaction, 30-Day Guarantee
Berkey Filters encourages you to test your product once it’s received. For this reason, we accept returns of products in new or used condition. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, for any reason within 30 days of your purchase date, you may call Customer Service for a RMA# (Return Merchandise Authorization Number). Packages received without a RMA # will be charged a 20% handling fee. Returned items must be in their original packaging, with all included parts and literature.
Returns can be made with the carrier and shipping method of your choice, at your expense.
Address your return to:
Berkey Filters
1981 Aspen Circle
Pueblo, CO. 81006
Please allow 7-10 business days, from the date we receive your return, for a refund to reflect back to the original form of payment used to place your order. *
Return instructions can be found on pages 19 - 21 of the Berkey Manual. (Note: Return instructions are comprehensive and all sections may not apply). Failure to follow return instruction will result in up to a 20% handling fee that will be deducted from the amount refunded.
The customer must obtain and monitor the tracking number for any items coming back to us.
*  If an eligible purchase included a free item, the free item must also be included in your return. Free items not returned will be billed as a deduction from the final refund at their full retail value.
Exchanges
For an exchange, please follow the instructions outlined in the above section. Please allow 7-10 business days, from the date we receive your exchange, for refund, at which point you may place a new order for replacement items.**
**If you would like to receive your exchange item as soon as possible, you may choose to pay the purchase price of the new product up front. Once a return is received, a refund will be processed for the original item(s).
We will cover the shipping on outbound items if the value is over $49. (Please refer to our shipping policy for additional information regarding carriers and shipping methods).
Our Warranty – Beyond 30 Days
Returns will not be accepted after 30 days of the purchase date. No exceptions.
In the event that a replacement is needed for a part covered under warranty, please call Customer Service for additional information regarding the exchange of an item and to receive a RMA # (Return Merchandise Authorization Number.)
Standard Manufacturer 6 Month Warranty
With the exception of the unit housings and Black Berkey Purification Elements, all products, including the Berkey PF-2 Fluoride Filters, parts, and accessories are warranted to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for 6 months from the purchase date.
Standard 2-Year Warranty, Prorated at 6-Month Intervals
The Black Berkey Purification Elements and unit housings are warranted to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a 2-year period, prorated in 6-month intervals.
Berkey Care Lifetime Warranty
For our customers, who purchase a new stainless steel system from this site, berkeyfilters.com, we offer a lifetime warranty  (Includes: Travel Berkey, Big Berkey, Royal Berkey, Imperial Berkey, and Crown Berkey).
There is no need to register. If you ever need to file a warranty claim, all you need is your order number, so please keep this number saved.
If at any time the unit housings, standard spigot, washers, hole plugs, knob, or wing-nuts of your stainless steel Berkey System fail in any way due to defects in materials or workmanship, contact Berkey Filters for additional information regarding the exchange of the item and to receive a RMA Number (Return Merchandise Authorization).
The Lifetime warranty does not cover damage caused by carelessness, accidents, or abuse/unintended use of the system. This warranty does not cover filters or scratch and dent units. This is an exclusive offer to our valued customers from Berkey Filters and is in addition to all other stated warranties.
Final Sale Items
Items marked as final sale are ineligible for returns or refunds. Final sale items may not be exchanged for cosmetic reasons or any other reason beyond that. Final Sale items are covered by the manufacturer warranty for defects in materials and workmanship.
Order Restrictions
California
Due to a California state law passed in 2010, we, as well as all other Berkey distributors, are prohibited from selling larger Berkey systems directly in the state of California. If you live in California, please consider our Berkey Light or Travel Berkey models. Accessories and replacement filters may be shipped directly into the state.
The state of California has established regulations and procedures for the sale of indoor water systems. Under these regulations, the state of California requires that any water treatment system that is sold in the state first be certified by an independent, third-party testing agency, such as the NSF, before the system can be considered eligible for sale in California. NSF Standard 42 (aesthetic effects) and Standard 53 (health effects) would specifically apply to our purification elements.
NSF Standard 42 covers systems designed to reduce specific aesthetic or non-health-related contaminants such as chlorine, taste, odor, and particulates that may be present in public or private drinking water.
NSF Standard 53 addresses systems designed to reduce specific health-related contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, lead, Volatile Organic Chemicals, and MTBE's that may be present in public or private drinking water.
The tests Berkey has conducted are much more rigorous than those required by NSF for the certifications mandated by the state of California. Berkey purifiers have been rigorously tested by third-party independent accredited labs far surpassing the above standard of taste, odor, and chlorine reduction. For example, Berkey purifiers have been tested for the removal of hundreds of contaminants including heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, pathogenic bacteria, and viruses. These test results are published and available to all of our consumers on our website. Although this extensive testing is sufficient for 49 states in the US, it is currently not acceptable for residents in the state of California.
Even after NSF certification has been obtained, the state of California additionally requires that companies pay high costs to obtain and maintain certification with the state of California.
After careful review, it has been concluded that the additional taxes, certifications, and red tape have created too large of a barrier for their dealers to offer the larger Berkey Systems in the state of California.
Iowa
The state of Iowa has established regulations and procedures for the sale of water systems.
The state of Iowa requires that any water treatment system that is sold in the state first be certified by an independent, third-party testing agency, such as NSF, before the system can be considered eligible for sale in Iowa. The cost for NSF Certification is very expensive and provides nothing of value in the emergency water treatment industry.
The tests Berkey has conducted are much more rigorous than those required by NSF for the certifications mandated by the state of Iowa. Berkey purifiers have been rigorously tested by third-party independent accredited labs far surpassing the above standard of taste, odor and chlorine reduction. These test results are published and available to all of our consumers on our website.
Even after NSF certification has been obtained, the state of Iowa additionally requires that systems further be registered with the Iowa Department of Public Health. One major problem arises because each flexible configuration we offer is considered by the state of Iowa to be a distinct and separate system that must be certified independently. Under Iowa legislation, the expense required to certify each system and maintain certification per configuration quickly becomes unaffordable.
While this may not be a problem for companies that are inflexible with respect to the systems they offer or have few product offerings, such requirements place a huge burden upon companies that do offer such flexibility, (i.e. multiple variations of water filter systems).
Berkey has concluded that the additional taxes, certifications, and red tape have created too large of a barrier for their dealers to offer Berkey Systems in the state of Iowa.
