You may download material displayed on the Web Sites for non-commercial, personal use only provided you also retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained on the materials. You may not distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, re-post, or use the content of the Web Sites for public or commercial purposes, including the text, images, audio, and video, without RockBottomGolf.com's written permission. RockBottomGolf.com neither warrants nor represents that your use of materials displayed on the Web Sites will not infringe rights of third parties not owned by or affiliated with RockBottomGolf.com.

Those who choose to access the Web Sites from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.
7. ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND CHOICE OF LAW
You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW OR IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
References to "RockBottomGolf.com" "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individualized action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ROCKBOTTOMGOLF.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to RockBottomGolf.com should be addressed to: PO Box 80, North Chili, NY 14514 United States of America. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If RockBottomGolf.com and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or RockBottomGolf.com may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by RockBottomGolf.com or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or RockBottomGolf.com is entitled.
The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse RockBottomGolf.com for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY, AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER OR RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR ISSUE ANY RELIEF ON ANY BASIS OTHER THAN AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER OR RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR ISSUE ANY RELIEF ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. Further, unless both you and RockBottomGolf.com agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.
Claims for enforcement, breach or violation of duties or rights under this Agreement will be adjudicated under the laws of the State of New York, without reference to conflict of laws principles. You hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state or federal courts in Monroe County, New York, USA in all non-arbitrated disputes arising out of or relating to the use of RockBottomGolf.com.
8. INTERPRETING THE AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT
If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in effect. RockBottomGolf.com may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. Except as expressly stated herein, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and RockBottomGolf.com, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and RockBottomGolf.com with respect to the RockBottomGolf.com Web Sites. The section titles in the Agreement are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance.

14. SALES & USE TAX NOTIFICATION
Purchases outside of New York and Virginia may be subject to Sales & Use Tax remittance by the purchaser unless the purchase is exempt from taxation. The purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the internet, by catalog, or by other remote means. Some States require purchasers to report all purchases of tangible personal property or digital property that are not taxed by the retailer and pay use tax on those purchases unless exempt by their State law. The tax may be reported and paid on individual income tax returns or by filing a consumer use tax return with their State. States under this policy known to us include Kentucky and Oklahoma, but others may also qualify. Please contact your State agency to determine applicable requirements.
