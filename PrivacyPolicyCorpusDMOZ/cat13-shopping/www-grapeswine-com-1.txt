choices are available to you regarding collection, use and

Information
Collection and Use
Grapes
Wine is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will
not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from
what is disclosed in this statement. Grapes Wine collects information from
our customers at several different points on our web site.
Registration
No registration is required in order to use this web site, although a
customer must create an account prior to any purchase. During account
creation a customer is required to give their name, e-mail address, zip
code, and a password. This information is used to contact our customers
about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It
is optional for a customer to provide a phone number, but encouraged so we can
have another means to contact you regarding your order.
Ordering
We
request information from our customers on our order form. Here a customer
must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and
financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This
information is used for billing purposes and to fill the customer's orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to
get in touch with the user.
Gift
Recipients
We collect contact information for gift recipients in order to ensure
correct gift delivery. We do not sell or rent any contact information for
gift recipients. Beyond completing delivery of their gift, we do not
contact gift recipients in any way.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the visitor's hard drive containing
information specific to that visitor's use of the web site. Any information
placed in the cookie is accessible only to www.grapeswine.com, and will not
be sold or shared with anyone else under any circumstances. We use a cookie
to store a unique session identifier, and this allows us to maintain your
shopping cart from one page request to the next. We are also able to
maintain your session information from one visit to the next. By setting a
cookie on our site, our customers do not have to log in more than once,
thereby saving time while on our site. If a customer rejects the cookie,
they may still browse our site. Unfortunately, the customer experience will
be greatly curtailed, as the customer will be unable to log in or make a
purchase.
Log
Files
We
use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track customer's
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP
addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing
Grapes Wine will share aggregate demographic information with its partners.
This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any
individual person.
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card
processing company to bill customers for goods and services. Our web site
is supported by the Beverage Network who help with the technical operation
of our web site and provide additional service as required. These companies
do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for
any secondary purposes.
We value your privacy very much at Grapes Wine, and will never release any
account information to anyone outside of the necessary core groups that
help our business function, like those mentioned above unless our customers
give us the authority to do so.
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Grapes
Wine is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We
encourage our customers to be aware when they leave our site and to read
the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
information collected by this web site.
Security
When our order form asks customers to enter sensitive information (such as
credit card number and/or social security number), that information is
encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the
industry - SSL (Secure Socket Layers), provided by Thawte, a leading encryption
software company available today. While on a secure page such as our order
form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
also do everything in our power to protect customer-information offline.
All of our customers' information, like the sensitive information mentioned
above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job (for example, a salesperson) are
given access to personally identifiable information.
If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send
an e-mail to our Customer Service
department.
Correcting/Updating
Personal Information
If your person information changes (such as your shipping or billing
address, etc.), you can add new information or delete any addresses or
credit cards from your account at the "My Account" page of our
site. You can also modify your login information and opt out of our
newsletter from the same page. Of course, if you prefer speak to a human,
we can be reached at 1-800-434-WINE. Thank you for letting us get you the best wine discounts on the best wines anywhere on the web.
