Home  Help  About Juno
Who we areJuno Records is the world's largest dance music and equipment store. Based in London, UK, our web site was launched in March 1996, and since then we have built a reputation as the most comprehensive source for new and back catalogue dance music, DJ and studio equipment. We now offer over 500 new releases each week, and have more than 45,000 titles in stock.What we doOur aim is to provide the best service, delivery times and customer support on the net. All orders received before 5pm are dispatched the same day, and are fully insured against loss or damage. Our customer service telephone lines are open 10am - 6pm Monday - Saturday, and outside working hours we guarantee a 24 hour e-mail response to customer enquiries made via our web site. Since opening, our reputation has grown by word of mouth - we have had orders from over one million customers in 156 countries, and 90% of our customers order again.What we don't doUnlike many other stores, our web site only shows what we have in stock (unless you ask to look at out-of-stock products). We don't try to increase sales by pre-selling or backordering items that we don't have. Our service and web site are deliberately simple and straightforward, and we provide as much information as possible in order to let you decide what you want to buy, quickly and simply.Security & privacyOrdering from Juno Records is 100% secure. The shopping cart area of the site is encrypted to ensure the security of all orders. You can view Juno's security certificate by clicking on the padlock icon in your web browser, while in the shopping cart. We have an absolute privacy policy for all customer information, and share no data with any third parties.
