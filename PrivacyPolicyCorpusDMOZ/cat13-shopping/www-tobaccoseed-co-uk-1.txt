Most people who use the Internet are naturally concerned about their personal information and wish to keep it personal.
At The Tobacco Seed Company, we use your personal details to send out your order and NOTHING else. Once your order has been dispatched, the order form is printed and filed for reference. The original email is deleted and nothing is held on our computers, except the payment details which PayPal keeps on its system.
That is why The Tobacco Seed Company NEVER pesters its customers with adverts, special offers, nor does it give any personal information to any other company or individual.
Our customers of course already know that.
