In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
Protecting Your Credit Card Information.
Hacking database files residing on LAN servers, connected to the Internet, which contain customer data, has been the primary mechanism by which virtually all credit card theft has occurred. Essentially all of the network operating systems whether they were Windows NT, Linux, Unix, or Novell have all been compromised at one time or another.To completely eliminate the risk of a security breach, we have taken the simplest and most reliable approach -- WE DO NOT STORE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. This completely eliminates the potential risk of any hacker obtaining valuable data from our systems.

By registering, you create a user profile which allows us to customize your experience on this Web site, as well as provide a faster method for you to submit a request for information to www.KosherVitamins.com and receive back either the information or products desired
When you voluntarily provide us with your information via a Web form on our Web site, or while corresponding with us via email. It is not necessary to provide any personally identifiable information in order to simply browse our Web site
Non-personal Information
KosherVitamins.com routinely gathers non-personal information, including how many people visit our Web site, the pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, their IP address, and the type of browser they used while visiting.

Non-personal information is gathered through the use of cookies, Web beacons and Web server logs.

You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies
A Web server log is a file where Web site activity is stored. Every time a visitor requests a file or Web page an entry is made into our server logs. These files include the HTML files and their imbedded graphic images and any other associated files that are transmitted to Web site visitors. Log files can be analyzed and summarized by another program
