Seating
For many children, sitting positions can be difficult to maintain. Jenx seating systems are designed to support children with all kinds of postural needs from complex to mild.
Plus they all come with a wide range of accessories and adjustments so each seat can be specifically tailored to the individual as required.
Standing
Children gain huge psychological benefits from standing, as well as important physical and developmental advantages. Which is why standing plays a crucial role in therapy programmes for children with many kinds of developmental needs.
Jenx offers a wide range of standers for children from 9months to adult, in upright, prone or supine.
Sleeping
We spend approximately a third of our lives sleeping, therefore a good position for sleep is important for comfort and helps to provide longer periods of rest.
The Dreama 24hr positioning system can be used as a preventative system or to reduce the risk of further postural deterioration and is appropriate for both any age and any level of complexity.
Therapy
Jenx therapy items are bright, easy-to-use therapy aids that children can quickly start to benefit from without undergoing formal assessment.
