Fundraisers We offer a fund-raiser program for those looking to raise money for any organization (school, club, etc). Our first big fund-raiser was in November of 2008, when 27 boys of the Emporia Wrestling team made over $2200.00 in profit. Your group may sell as many flavors of jerky as you wish but we recommend starting out with our top 3 flavors, Mild, Hot and Teriyaki. We provide you with a copy of the order form and information you will need to get started. Just print off the amount of forms you need and start selling. When you are done, you can call, fax or email your totals in. We can either ship your orders (free shipping if your order is $500.00 or more) or you can pick them up at the factory. For more information, call toll free (800-322-0868) or send us an email.
Shipping Orders are shipped through USPS Priority Mail. Any order over $89.00 is free shipping, anything under that amount will have a standard fee of $9.99. If you place an order on Friday after 10:30 am CST through Tuesday morning before 10:30 am CST, your order will go out Tuesday morning. If you order after 11:00 am Tuesday but before 10:30 am on Wednesday, it will be shipped Wednesday morning. The same goes for the remainder of the week. Expect the shipment to arrive between one to four business days, depending on your location. Delivery areas include military addresses.Please contact us about International Orders.
