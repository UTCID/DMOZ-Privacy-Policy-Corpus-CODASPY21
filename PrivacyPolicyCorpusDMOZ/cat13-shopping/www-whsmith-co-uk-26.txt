WEEE Policy
Each year in the UK, people throw away over 1.2 million tonnes of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). That's the equivalent of 150,000 double-decker buses.
Electrical products are often full of nasty chemicals and can have a harmful effect on natural habitat, wildlife and also human health. It is very important that these products are either recycled or otherwise disposed of safely.
All new electrical products now carry a symbol of a crossed-out wheelie bin. This means it should be disposed of carefully, and not thrown out with general household waste.
At WHSmith, we are helping to upgrade local Civic Amenity sites across the UK where you can take your old electrical items for a safe, free-of-charge disposal. We cannot dispose of your old products in-store.
You can find out the location of your nearest WEEE-compliant Civic Amenity site by entering your post code at www.recycle-more.co.uk
Under the Waste Battery Regulations, WHSmith are now offering a take back scheme for all portable waste batteries in all of our participating high street stores.
Alternatively, you can find your local waste portable battery recycling facility at www.recyclenow.com. Most supermarkets and shops that sell batteries will have collection bins for used batteries, and some town halls or libraries may also set up collection points. End-users may find stores in their local area more accessible.
