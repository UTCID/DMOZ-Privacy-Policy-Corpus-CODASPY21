In addition to the information listed above, you may choose to give to us directly other types of information in a variety of situations.  For example, when making a warranty claim you may provide digital images of you or your property, including images of the Company products you purchased.  You may also provide your credit card details to purchase products or services from us or you may share product feedback relating to a Company product you purchased.  We may also collect sensitive personal information such as information about your age, race, ethnicity, gender and other demographic information.  You may also provide health information when making claims relating to personal injuries which you allege to have resulted from Company products.
We may also be given your information from third party companies who have collected the information previously or who have made assumptions about you based on information you have shared with them.

To detect and prevent fraud or intellectual property infringement;

To investigate claims, accidents or incidents related to our products and services.
The particular reason for our collection or use of your information depends on the particular activity for which your information is used.
WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We have controls to limit access to your information to:
Individual colleagues who need it to do their job, such as providing customer service or warranty service, fulfilling orders and processing payments
Trusted business partners who need your information to provide services to us, such as delivering your orders, maintaining our computer systems, providing analytics and advice or administering marketing and advertising campaigns.
If requested, and where it is required or permitted by law, we may provide your information to:
Official bodies, such as government agencies, local authorities, regulators and the police;
The Company’s advisors, including lawyers, insurers, accountants and auditors;
Other organizations such as law firms or insurance companies in response to a demand for information pursuant to judicial proceedings, court orders, or legal process.
We may also share your information with another organization with which we enter into an arrangement for a merger, purchase or sale involving our Company or any subsidiary or division of our Company.
Because we operate as part of a global business, the recipients of your information may be located outside the jurisdiction in which you are located.  The transfer of your information will be subject to the reasonable security measures described below.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We will not use your personal information for any purpose other than the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
We use reasonable security measures, including physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to help us protect your information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.  These measures may include encryption, security certificates, access controls, information security technologies, policies, procedures and other information security measures to help protect your information. We also require our suppliers to protect such information from unauthorized access use and disclosure.
PERSONAL INFORMATION OF EU RESIDENTS
Under European Union privacy laws (“EU Privacy Laws”), the Company is a controller of information that the Company receives.  The Company stores, processes and transfers your information for the purposes, in the manners and using the methods described in this Privacy Policy.  EU Privacy Laws require that the Company have a legal basis to process the personal information of EU residents.  In all cases, the collection and use of your personal information is the result of (i) our receipt of your consent, (ii) our need to use your information to meet our legal or contractual obligations, or (iii) our need to use your information for our legitimate business purposes.  We retain your information for as long as we have a relationship with you and for a period after the relationship has ended.  When determining how long to keep your personal information after our relationship with you has ended, we take into account how long we need to retain the information to fulfill the purposes described above.
We may transfer, process and store your personal information outside of your home country, including in the United States and Canada, which may not have the same level of data protection as your home country.  For the avoidance of doubt, if you are an EU resident this may include the transfer of your personal information from within the EU to a country outside of the EU.  We have put in place appropriate safeguards for such transfers (such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission) in accordance with EU Privacy Laws.
Some of the processing we conduct will involve making decisions about you based on automated processing of your personal information.  For example, we may conduct profiling activities to select personalized offers or recommendations for you based on your browsing history or your purchase of Company products.  If you are an EU resident, where these decisions are based solely on our automated processing of your personal data, these types of decisions will not have legal or similar effects on you, but you can still contact us for further information and to object to this use of your personal information.
EU Privacy Laws set the rules on when we can send direct marketing communications to you via email, SMS or post.  In some circumstances we are required to obtain your affirmative consent.  In others, such as the direct marketing of similar products and services to existing customers, it is possible to obtain your consent via an ‘opt out’ method (e.g. you choose to unsubscribe from receiving advertising communications).  If you wish to stop any direct marketing, you may deactivate your account with the Company and/or opt-out of receiving marketing communications using the methods described in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Your Control of Your Information.”  If we ask for your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy.
In addition to the rights described in the section entitled “Your Control of Your Information,” if you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information.  These rights may include, depending on your country or state of residence, the rights to:  access your personal information; rectify the personal information we hold about you; erase your personal information; restrict our use of your personal information; object to our use of your personal information; receive your personal information in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); lodge a complaint without your local data protection authority; and withdraw any consent you have given to use your personal information.  If you wish to exercise any of the rights that you may have, please contact us by email at privacy@hamiltonbeach.com or submit your request by completing the Individual Rights Requests online form.
PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) California residents have certain rights relating to the access, sale, disclosure and deletion of their personal information.  The rights and obligations described in this section of the Privacy Policy are governed by the CCPA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended.  The Company stores, processes and transfers your information for the purposes, in the manners and using the methods described in this Privacy Policy.  Under the CCPA, California residents have the right to request that the Company disclose what personal information it collects, uses, discloses and sells.  The descriptions of the categories of personal information the Company collects and the third parties with whom the Company may share personal information is provided in this Privacy Policy under the sections entitled “What Information We Collect” and “With Whom Do We Share Your Information.”  The Company does not and will not sell your personal information.  The CCPA also provides a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by the Company for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.  The Company complies with this non-discrimination right in its administration of sales and promotional programs and in its response to any request received pursuant to this provision of the Company’s privacy policy.
In addition to the rights described in the section entitled “Your Control of Your Information,” if you are a California resident, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information.  These rights may include, the rights to:  access your personal information; request the deletion of your personal information; and receive your personal information in a portable and readily usable format.  If you wish to exercise any of the rights that you may have, please contact us by email at privacy@hamiltonbeach.com or by toll free phone at 1-800-851-8900 or submit your request by completing the Individual Rights Requests online form. In order to exercise your rights, you are required to submit a request and provide in your request certain basic information about yourself which is necessary to identify your personal information and to verify your identity, including your name, email address, telephone number and mailing address.  In response to your request, the Company may request additional information which may be necessary to verify your identity and/or to identify any personal information that may be in the Company’s possession.  Your failure or refusal to provide sufficient information to identify your personal information or to verify your identity will be grounds for denying your request.  In the event that the Company requests from you additional information to identify whether the Company is in possession of your personal information or to verify your identity said request for additional information shall not be regarded as a statement as to whether the Company is or is not in possession of your personal information nor shall it be regarded as a statement as to the Company’s intention to fulfill or deny all or any part of your request.  Upon receipt of any information that the Company requires to identify your personal information and to verify your identity, the Company will conduct an investigation to determine if your request can be fulfilled.  The Company will comply with the CCPA by responding to your request within the time period proscribed by the relevant laws and regulations.
