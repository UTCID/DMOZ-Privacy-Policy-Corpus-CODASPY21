How are my flowers delivered?
In order to guarantee the freshness of our products, all our fresh-cut flower bouquets are shipped overnight or second day. Also enclosed are your personal message and flower food. A vase may be added to most of our arrangements during the ordering process. Roses arrive in bud form and will bloom in 1-2 days.
How long will it take for my flowers to bloom?
Roses typically start to bloom within 24 hours of delivery. Depending on the type of flower, it may take between 3-7 days for your flowers to fully open.
How much are shipping charges?
Standard shipping charges for delivery of 50 stems from Tuesday through Friday are $27.99, depending on shipping location. For Saturday delivery, add an extra $15.00 to the standard delivery charge for all available locations.
Where do we deliver?
Delivery in the US.
What days of the week do we deliver?
All of the products on our website are available for delivery Tuesday through Saturday, unless the pickup or delivery date falls on a major holiday.
For Tuesday through Saturday delivery, orders must be placed before 11an EST the day before you would like your shipment to arrive.
Why are there no deliveries on Sundays and Mondays?
Our shipping carriers do not deliver on Sundays, and do not pick up merchandise on Sundays for Monday delivery.
What time will the flowers arrive
In most circumstances, flowers will be delivered by noon. There may be exceptions if the recipient lives in Alaska, Hawaii or a rural location.
Additionally, if there is poor weather in the area, or any other acts of God which may delay our carriers, delivery may not take place until later in the day..
There is a chance that FEDEX/UPS might deliver your flowers one day after the requested delivery date due to mechanical problems or hazardous weather conditions.
Do the flowers come in a vase?
Usually, we ship the bouquets without vases. However, if you prefer to have a vase shipped along with the flowers, you can buy one for an additional charge. You can choose a vase to buy when you are ordering the bouquet.
The vases you can choose from vary from bouquet to bouquet. This is because our growers each have different vases, and different ones are available at different times. Still, I promise that we will have one available that is appropriate and looks nice with the flowers! Also see above for information on how our flowers are packaged (above).
How are your fowers packaged?
All of our flowers are placed in specially designed shipping boxes, and are secured in place so that they move as little as possible during transit. This ensures that your flowers will arrive in good condition.
in order to protect the rose head during shipping, we ship them with the guard petals. Upon removal of the protective packaging, carefully peel off any brown or discolored petals.
What happens if my recipient is not present at the time of delivery?
If possible, we recommend shipping your order where someone is available to sign for it.
In most cases the signature confirmation will be required, however the delivery driver will knock or ring the bell, and if there is no answer, may leave the product somewhere safe at the delivery location.
Promotions and Discounts
Free Shipping on Select Items is a seasonal offer, applicable to qualify products for a limited time.  Not valid on shipments during Valentine's Day and Mother’s Day holidays.
