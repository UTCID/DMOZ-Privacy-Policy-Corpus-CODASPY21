About UsTag-A-Room is the original creator of the color coded moving and storage label systems. Tag-A-Room was created over 30 years ago by the owner of a small moving company in San Antonio, Texas, to differentiate his company from other moving companies. He used labels to organize the boxes and furniture throughout the move process, thus reducing the chance of having mismarked, misplaced boxes which resulted in customers’ saving of time and money. There was no more asking “Where does it go?”.
30 years later, Tag-A-Room has grown into its own company serving customers nationwide with hundreds of line items. Tag-A-Room provides “Moving and Storage Solutions” to various clients that include: move managers, moving companies, mortgage companies, realtors, retail outlets, and of course our original customer “the end user”. Our products are unique and cost effective, but most importantly they help relieve some of the stress associated with moving, by providing a smooth more organized move experience.
