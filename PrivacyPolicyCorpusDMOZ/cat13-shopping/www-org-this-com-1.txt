Simply put, we don’t track anything at this website.  We don’t care.  If you’re here and you want to read our stuff – good for you.  If you’re here by mistake and you take off, that’s okay too.
But we run no cookies. We track no data.  We capture nothing unless you use our contact form to leave us a message or ask us a question.  That’s it.  Privacy Statement done in 3 minutes.
