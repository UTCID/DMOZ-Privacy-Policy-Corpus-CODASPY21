Dr. Doormat - Security & Privacy Policy
Security
The Dr.Doormat web site uses sophisticated, industry-standard security software to keep your personal and credit card information from being compromised
as it travels across the Internet. It's safer to use your credit card over the Internet than it is to use it in a restaurant or department store.
Because we care about the safety of your credit card transaction, our server uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with
Netscape Navigator (versions 2.0 and above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (versions 3.0 and above), and AOL (versions 3.0 and above) so that unauthorized
parties cannot read the information that you send. It's our way of making sure your credit card is safe and secure.
