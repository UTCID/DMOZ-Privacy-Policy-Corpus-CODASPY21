While not restricted to NashuaNutrition.com customers in the United States of America, the Program is not available in all countries. There is no cost to become a Nashua Nutrition Rewards “Refer-a-Friend” Program Member ("Member") or to maintain Membership. Membership begins when you register for an account at NashuaNutrition.com.

NashuaNutrition.com reserves the right to exclude individuals or restrict eligibility from the Referral Program in its sole discretion.

"REFER-A-FRIEND" REWARDS
As a Registered User on NashuaNutrition.com, you may be eligible to receive referral reward(s) for introducing a friend or family member (from a different household) to NashuaNutrition.com resulting in a first purchase. To be eligible for a referral reward:
You must have a Registered Account at NashuaNutrition.com
You must refer a friend or family member from a household other than yours ("referee") who has never shopped at NashuaNutrition.com, and
The referee must sign up to become a Registered User AND make their first purchase over $49 at NashuaNutrition.com.
As a registered user at NashuaNutrition.com, you will be issued a unique “Referral Code” and “Referral Link” you may share with your friends and family members from other households who are not currently registered at NashuaNutrition.com. A referee who registers at NashuaNutrition.com for the first time either through your “Referral Link”, or by entering your “Referral Code” at the time she/he registers, will receive a discount code to receive 10% off her/his first order of $49+ at NashuaNutrition.com. You will receive 400 NashCash Points ($10 value) applied to your account when the referee makes their first purchase at NashuaNutrition.com over $49. The “referee” will not be considered valid, and will not receive a discount code to receive 10% off her/his first order of $49+, nor will you receive 400 NashCash Points ($10 value) upon their first purchase if (i) the household to which he/she belongs already has an account with NashuaNutrition.com or (ii) the referee did not either follow your referral link or enter your Referral Code when registering. You may provide us with email addresses of prospective New Members and the Company may send emails on your behalf to encourage them to open an account with the Company.

Referral rewards may be applied to product value only; rewards cannot be applied to taxes or shipping. Referral rewards must be redeemed within 180 days of issuance.
Monetary referral rewards, including cash discounts/coupons, may be used for only one transaction. If the value of the reward exceeds the value of the product purchased in the transaction, the unused portion of the reward will be forfeited. There will be no refunds or balances maintained for partially used rewards.
