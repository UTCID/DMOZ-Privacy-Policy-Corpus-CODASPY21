Privacy
Policy
We understand your need for privacy and we
completely respect it.  If you don’t
trust us, you won’t buy from us.  To help you
better understand what we do (and DON'T do) with your information, we’ve
written out our privacy policy out for you in simple terms (even Rocky can
understand it):
Mailing List
If
you sign up for our Newsletter, you provide us with your email address and full
name. We will only send you emails once every other month or so updating you
with new products, specials, sales, closeouts, etc.  We will NEVER give / sell / rent any of your
information (email, name, address, etc) to ANYONE.  PERIOD.
If
you choose to opt out of our email, we will delete your name immediately.  When you place an order, you’re asked to
check a box if you’d like to sign up.  If
you do NOT want to sign up, don’t check the box.  If you accidentally checked the box, let us
know and we’ll delete you from our mailing list manually.  If you need to be taken off the mailing list,
please email me at rocky@usakilts.com
Our Commitment to Your
Privacy
This site is owned and operated by USA
Kilts. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us.  We want to make your experience online
satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our
users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding
the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what
information we gather and how we use it.
USA Kilts gathers two types of information
about users:
Information that users provide through
optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our
electronic newsletters, to email a friend, and your name and address (if / when
you checkout).
Information USA Kilts gathers through
tracking information is derived by tallying page views throughout our site. This
information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs and to help
us better understand the demographics of our customers. As in the Mailing list
above, you’ll note that we don’t ever sell / give / rent any of your information
to anyone.
Usage Tracking
USA
Kilts tracks user traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not track
data about individual users.  USA Kilts
does break down overall usage statistics according to a user’s domain name,
browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string
(information contained in every user’s browser).  We also track “keyword searches” that bring
customers to our sites from sites like www.yahoo.com and
www.google.com.
Cookies
We
may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer.
The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable
us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and
knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is
information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or
read cookie files created by other sites.
You
can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your
browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning
message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this
site. However, if you place something in your cart and leave the site and come
back 3 days later, cookies will enable that item to remain in your
cart.
Sharing of Information
USA
Kilts uses the information we gather to tailor our website’s content to suit
your needs and help us understand our customers’ demographics. This is essential
to helping us make USA Kilts the best kilt company on the net. We will not share
information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with
applicable law or valid legal process.
Security
USA
Kilts operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and
password protection systems. Our website has its’ own dedicated server to help
heighten the level of security.  Our
security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as
necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information
provided by our customers.
Our Online Store and Credit Card
Information
When you pay using a credit card in our
Online Store, we immediately process that transaction. That means that we get an
immediate response from your credit card company as to whether the transaction
passed or failed. No matter what the result, we do not store your credit card
number. All we store is the confirmation code your credit card company sends to
us. We do not see your card number.  This
makes for a VERY secure transaction.
USA
Kilts does NOT store credit card or other sensitive information on its servers.
Any such information is temporarily stored on our secure Gateway, operated by
USAePay, Inc at the time of the order.
Children
Consistent with the Federal Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request
personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without
requesting parental consent.  Our website
contains no “questionable” or “adult content”.
Your Consent
By
using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by
USA Kilts. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how
we use it.
If you have
any questions, please contact us at Rocky@USAKilts.com
