Returns Policy
All flowers and arrangements are despatched in perfect condition.  Occasionally they do get upset during the delivery.  If this occurs please contact us immediately and we will endeavour to replace the flowers on the same day.  Please retain the flowers so we can pick them up when we redeliver.
Our shop policy is to issue a store credit for goods if they are returned still sealed in their original packaging and within 30 days of purchase.  We reserve the right to refuse to issue a store credit if we suspect the items have been used.

If the goods you receive are faulty, we will replace those goods if they are returned to our shop within 30 days of purchase. Reimbursement for shipping expenses will be up to the value of the original quoted shipping cost.
After 30 days returns are at our discretion.  Please contact us to discuss.
