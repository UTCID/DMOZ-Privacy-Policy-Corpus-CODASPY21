Your confidence is crucial to our success. We want you to be comfortable entrusting
us with your personal data. Towards that end we make this commitment to you:
We will never use your information for any purpose other than fulfilling
your order without your express permission.
We are a online retail military surplus and camping supplies store and are
not in the business of either selling email addresses or other demographic information
to marketing companies.
We do have an occasional email newsletter with sales and promotions which customers
may elect to receive. If you decide that you do not wish to receive this newsletter,
please simply contact us at info@armygear.net
and we will remove you from our mailing list.
We thank you for your patronage and hope you will be a satisfied customer of
ours for years to come.
Sincerely,
The Armygear.net Staff
