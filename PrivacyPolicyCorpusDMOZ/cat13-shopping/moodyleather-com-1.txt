Legal Terms
Moody makes every strap to order by hand using the finest imported Italian leather. Leather has naturally occurring markings and blemishes. These markings are minimal in the leather we use. Each and every strap is inspected 3 times before it is shipped to our customer. If it doesn’t pass inspection, we do not sell these factory seconds to our customers. We occasionally donate these defective straps to local musical education non-profits. If you receive a strap and are not completely satisfied with the quality, please send us an email with a photo. You must contact us within 1 week of receiving your strap if you are not completely satisfied. Otherwise, we may not be able to accommodate an exchange or refund. All returns must be accompanied by the original invoice and an approval email from the Moody staff, your contact and return mailing information and phone number. Please note that we can only accept unused straps for return or exchange.
