Information About Our Use Of Cookies
Cotswold Outdoor uses cookies and similar technologies to distinguish your usage preferences from those of other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a better user experience when you visit our website and allows us to optimise our website.
As a result of recent legislative changes, all websites targeting certain parts of the European Union are required to ask for your permission to use or store cookies and similar technologies on your computers or mobile devices. This cookie policy gives you clear and complete information about the cookies we use and their purpose. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn about the privacy rules that apply to the website.
Our use of Adobe Analytics cookies
Adobe technology is central to the operation of our web platforms. Because Adobe technology is critical to the operation of our website and we want to continue to guarantee you the best online experience, we currently consider Adobe Analytics cookies as functional cookies that support the operation of the website.
For further information about this Cookie Policy, you can contact us at customer.services@cotswoldoutdoor.com
What Is A Cookie?
A cookie is a small text and number file that we store in your browser or on the hard drive of your computer. That way we can remember your preferences when using our website.
As soon as you visit www.cotswoldoutdoor.com you will be asked for permission to place different categories of cookies that we use.
Types Of Cookies
Cookies can be divided according to their origin, their function and their lifespan.
First party cookies are those cookies that are placed by a website that is currently being visited by the user (eg cookies placed by www.cotswoldoutdoor.com).
Third-party cookies are cookies that are placed by a domain name other than that of the website visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a third party places a cookie via that website, this is a third-party cookie (eg cookies placed by Google, Twitter and Facebook).
Functional cookies are cookies that ensure that the website functions properly (eg cookies for log-in or registration, language preferences). Functional cookies are logically first party cookies.
Non-functional cookies are cookies that can be placed for statistical, social, targeting and commercial purposes. They have nothing to do with the purely technical support of the website. Cookies with static purposes allow to check which pages of the website you visit, where your computer is located, etc. Cookies with social purposes enable the user to share the content of the visited website directly with others via social media. Cookies with targeting purposes allow a profile to be built based on your surfing behavior so that the advertisements displayed are tailored to your interests. Cookies with commercial purposes keep track of how many and which advertisements were shown to a user. Non-functional cookies can be first party or third party cookies.
Permanent cookies: These cookies remain on the user's device for the duration specified in the cookie. They are activated every time the user visits the website that has placed this cookie (eg cookies placed by social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Google Analytics, etc.). Most non-functional cookies are permanent cookies.
Session cookies: These cookies allow us to simplify the actions of a user and to link them during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser screen and ends when they close the browser screen. Session cookies are placed temporarily. As soon as you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted. Most functional cookies are session cookies.
Your Consent
By using our website, you accept the use of mandatory cookies. We have bundled the other types of cookies and tracking mechanisms into two groups: analytical cookies and marketing cookies. We only install these cookies if we have your permission. You can always change your cookie settings afterwards via the link to the cookie policy at the bottom of every page of the website.
Change Your Browser Settings
We point out that web browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings can usually be found in the 'Options' or 'Preferences' menu of your web browser. To better understand these settings, the following links may be helpful. If not, you should consult the 'Help' function in your web browser for more details.
