Home/Home & Décor/Household Helpers
We all want to live in a safe, clean, comfortable and organized environment. Although you may not have much control over those factors beyond your doorstep, you definitely can attain those goals within your home. The pest eliminators, clocks, fans, mailboxes and household helpers available at Lehman's make it easy.
We carry a potpourri of hard-to-find products you may remember from your childhood. To protect your fine woolen clothing, we offer items designed to thwart destructive moths. Opening a pack of our mothballs will take you back in time to the way your mother protected your woolen and other garments from these fiber-eating pests. We also carry cedar hangers to discourage insects from damaging your treasured garments.
Want to keep cool during the dog days of summer? A personal battery-operated fan will provide a refreshing breeze while our solar-powered roof fan will help keep your whole house cool.
If you value your U.S. mail, check out our indestructible mailboxes. These Amish-made aluminum mailboxes will protect your precious correspondence from vandals, snowplows and variety of other threats.
You'll also find safety items here that can protect your family from fires. Our smoke alarms and two-story escape ladders are good insurance you hope you'll never have to use but could save the lives of your nearest and dearest in an emergency.
We carry old-fashioned windup and water-powered clocks that won't quit even when the electricity does. You'll also find dozens of other useful items here for practically any purpose around the home from soap dishes to stoneware crocks and wash basins.
