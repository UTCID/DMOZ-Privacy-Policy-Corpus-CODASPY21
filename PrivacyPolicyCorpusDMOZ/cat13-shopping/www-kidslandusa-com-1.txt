Privacy Policy
Terms & Conditions
At Kidslandusa.com, your privacy and security is paramount to the continuous on going relationship with you, our customers. We respect and understand your concern for privacy and one of our missions is to ensure that all information you choose to share with us is handled in the most safe and responsible manner. We have undertaken to create a safe online environment and implemented security standards to establish a comfortable and safe shopping environment you deserve.
Kidslandusa.com continuously gathers online customer activity and information in order to make the necessary enhancements for improving the online shopping experience of our users. Your personal information such as name, address, telephone number, credit card number, and e-mail address, which then are collected allow us to achieve this objective. Furthermore, as an official company policy, Kidslandusa.com does not under any circumstance sell or divulges its customer information to any third party.
We protect your information by storing it on a secure web server in a private database. Periodically, Kidslandusa.com sends e-mail messages containing specials offering, sales and promotions to the members on our mailing list.

The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many of the websites. At Kidslandusa.com, we use cookies as a tool to personalize your online shopping experience and assess our efforts to provide an easier, more streamlined online shopping experience. For example, cookies can be utilized to recognize you as a repeat customer each time you visit our site; it allows us to retrieve your order history and personal information so you do not have to re-enter it every time you shop. This means you can store items in your shopping bag between visits and maintain your very own special events calendar and address book. Another cookie lets us know what pages you visit as well as your browsing, shopping, and searching patterns. This enables us to identify ways to customize our online shopping environment to the preferences of our customers.
