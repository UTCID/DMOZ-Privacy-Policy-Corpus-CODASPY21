Unanticipated Use and Policy Changes
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. We will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward.
Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by sending us e-mail at the above address or writing to us at the above address.
Upon request we provide site visitors with access to the transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) that we maintain about them and a description of information that we maintain about them.

With respect to security: We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the transmission of information you submit to us when you use our secure online forms.
If you send us an email, you should know that email is not necessarily secure against interception. So, if your communication includes sensitive information like your bank account, charge card, or social security number, and you prefer not, or are unable, to use one of our secure online forms, contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than email.

Norman Camera makes the following assurances and conditions for all photos shared with us by third parties:
All submissions are considered intellectual property of their respective submitters, including all rights to usage and display.
A submission can be altered or removed at any time by the original submitter at their request.
All submissions are intended for public viewing, demonstration, and illustrative purposes only.
No submission will be used by Norman Camera for any commercial end (including but not limited to advertisements, promotions, and fliers) without first obtaining written permission from the submitter.

Cookie
A "cookie"is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer.
