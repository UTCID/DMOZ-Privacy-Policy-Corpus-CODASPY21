We are your source for craft supplies. We offer a wide variety of general craft supplies, beads, miniatures, jewelry findings, bolo making supplies, cords, plastic canvas and much more for your project, including some things that others do not carry. Our quality service will please you!
About Us:
A family owned and operated business, BJ's Craft Supplies began with a meager store in the Texas Rio Grande Valley. The store grew and customers began calling us to mail their supplies to them. Online since 1994, BJ's Craft Supplies now serves customers world wide.
BJ stepped down in 2012 and in 2014, her daughter, Pam, took over. We strive to treat you like we want to be treated and to provide you with quality craft supplies, excellent customer service, and fast shipping.
