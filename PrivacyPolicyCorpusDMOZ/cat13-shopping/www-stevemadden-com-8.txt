("Steve Madden", "we", "our" or "us"). There is no purchase, payment or credit card required to sign up for, join and/or participate in the Basic Tier of the Program. Members in the Basic Tier have the option to upgrade to the paid membership tier of SM PASS+. To be eligible for participation in the Program, you must be a United States resident and at least thirteen (13) years of age or older. We will not collect personally identifiable information from any person that is actually known to us to be a child under the age of thirteen (13). Persons under the age of eighteen (18) or the applicable age of majority in their legal state of residence (collectively, "Minors") must obtain the consent of their parent or legal guardian prior to participation in the Program. The Program is available only to individuals for their personal use and is limited to one (1) account per individual. Employees of Steve Madden and its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions are eligible to participate in the Program only for personal use. The Program is void where prohibited or restricted by law.
By joining the Program and becoming an SM PASS member, you agree (or in the case of a Minor participant, the parent or legal guardian of such Minor must agree on the Minor's behalf) that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these SM PASS Loyalty Program Terms of Use ("Terms") and by any changes or modifications that we may make hereto as well as all other terms of use and policies incorporated by reference. We reserve the right to revise these Terms at any time in our discretion without prior notice to you.

Program Enrollment
2.1. Eligible individuals may enroll in the Program at participating Steve Madden stores or online by visiting SteveMadden.com. To enroll in-store, see a sales associate at a participating store for assistance. When you enroll in-store, you will receive a welcome email that will include instructions for creating an online SM PASS account. The Program is not available at the following store locations: Colorado and Utah, or the Freebird by Steven location in Nashville, TN. To enroll online, visit SteveMadden.com and follow the Program prompts to enroll. You must have a valid SteveMadden.com account to complete your registration for the Program, regardless of whether you enroll in-store or online. It is free to sign up for a SteveMadden.com account and it is also free to enroll in the Basic Tier of the Program. There is no requirement to make any payment or purchase or to provide any credit card information to sign up for a SteveMadden.com account or to enroll in the Basic Tier of the SM PASS Program.
2.2. To enroll in the Program, you may be required to provide any or all of the following: your first and last name, valid email address, telephone number and zip code. You are solely responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your account information and for keeping it up-to-date as may be required. You may update your personal information through your online account or by contacting customer service at 1-888-526-2881, seven (7) days a week, between the hours of 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM Eastern Time.
2.3. Only one Program account may be associated with a single email address. In the event of a dispute over the ownership of a Program account membership, the Program member will be deemed to be the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of Program enrollment. "Authorized account holder" is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address. Enrolling or attempting to enroll in the Program multiple times through the use of multiple email addresses is prohibited and any such action will be cause for termination of your participation in the Program.
2.4. If you decide to upgrade your Basic Tier membership to SM PASS+, the fee to upgrade to SM PASS+ is $49.95 per year plus any applicable taxes. This fee is nonrefundable. Your annual membership is a 12-month membership that will commence upon the date upon which you signed up for SM PASS+ and paid the annual fee. SM PASS+ membership does not automatically renew. At the end of your 12-month membership, you will be notified via email and given the option to renew your membership for the next 12 months. Enrollment and participation in the membership program are voluntary, optional and not required to complete any transaction or sale, including but not limited to, any credit or debit transaction. The annual SM PASS+ membership fee may change from year to year as determined by Steve Madden in its sole discretion.
How the Program Works/Program Rewards.
3.1. The Program allows you to earn rewards based on qualifying purchases. Once you earn rewards you may be eligible to redeem rewards for certain benefits, which benefits and rewards may change from time to time and may be offered on a limited basis. Visit our FAQs and program dashboard page to learn more about how to earn rewards.
3.2. Purchases made at participating Steve Madden retail stores, Steve Madden outlets and online at SteveMadden.com are eligible for earning rewards in the Program, excluding gift card purchases, taxes, shipping and handling charges and any other fees associated with your purchase (a "Qualifying Purchase").
3.2.1. To earn rewards for a Qualifying Purchase made in-store, prior to completion of the sales transaction, you will be required to show your loyalty ID to the store sales associate using our free mobile app or to provide the store sales associate with one of the following: email address, or first and last name. Rewards cannot be applied towards past purchases made prior to the Program launch or prior to your enrollment in the Program.
3.2.2. To earn rewards for a Qualifying Purchase made online, you must be logged into your SM PASS account at the time of purchase. Rewards cannot be earned retroactively for online orders that have already been completed prior to logging into your SM PASS account. You can check for your available awards online at any time through your SM PASS account. Please allow approximately 14 days after a Qualifying Purchase for your SM PASS account to update to reflect your rewards earned.
3.3. Program rewards have no cash value, cannot be sold and are non-transferable. Program accounts, rewards or benefits cannot be transferred to, shared or combined with any other person or Program member. Only the Program member that is paying for the Qualifying Purchase may accumulate rewards and benefits and only the Program member may redeem rewards that have accumulated in that member's account. The sale, barter, transfer or assignment of any reward or benefit offered through the Program, other than by us, is expressly prohibited and will be cause for termination of your participation in the Program, and any rewards or benefits offered by us under the Program are subject to change at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice.
3.4. If you return an item from a Qualifying Purchase for a refund to your original method of payment, you will be issued a new reward for your next purchase. In the case of a multi item purchase, which results in a partial return, the reward will be considered used and will not be reissued. If the item is instead exchanged, the value of the reward may be reapplied to your exchanged item.
3.5. Rewards available through the Program are for personal use only and may not be sold or resold. We reserve the right, without notice, to cancel or reduce the quantity of any reward available through the Program at any time, in our sole discretion. We also reserve the right, without notice, to change Program benefits and ways in which rewards may be earned or redeemed at any time, in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to place limitations on the number of Qualifying Purchases that are eligible for the Program and/or the number or types of rewards that you may receive or earn during any given period of time or for the duration of the Program and/or any combination thereof.
3.6. We are not responsible for rewards that may be lost or redeemed as the result of any fraudulent activity.
3.7. We reserve the right to determine the rewards in any SM PASS member's account based upon our internal records related to such member's account. A member's rewards shall be deemed correct and accurate as reflected in our records and our good faith determination of the amount of rewards available to any member shall be final and binding.
If you have concerns regarding your SM PASS account activity, including, by way of example and not limitation, rewards earned for a Qualifying Purchase that have not been properly applied to your SM PASS account, please contact our customer service team by email at info@stevemaddendirect.com or by telephone at 1-888-526-2881, seven (7) days a week, between the hours of 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM Eastern Time.
