How long will it take to get my order?
Most orders ship within 1 to 3 business days. In some situations if we are experiencing a delay in obtaining raw materials for a product you order, it could take longer. Custom orders or personalized product will take longer, up to one week. If you need your order for an event or a firm date, let us know. We will work with you to choose the best shipping options and, if needed, a Rush Service to meet your deadline. While some products may ship from inventory, we a are an efficient "make to order" shop, so most products need a one day lead time for manufacturing the day after the order is received. Green Mountain Bags take an extra 5 days.

The recipient is liable for any import taxes, customs duties, additional fees for customs clearance or other import fees which are levied after the shipment leaves our facility. We are not responsible for any delays caused by the Customs clearance policies and as these fees and policies vary greatly we cannot predict any delays or the amount of any such fees.

These rates are per package.  Very large orders could require more than one package, therefore incur higher shipping charges.
Please keep in mind when placing your order that shipping and/or order processing can be affected by extreme weather or natural disasters or even higher than normal package loads at the shipping companies.  We have no control over these situations and cannot estimate the potential delay.
Occasionally packages are returned to us as undeliverable.  If this happens, our customer service staff will attempt to reach the intended purchaser or recipient.  If for some reason we are unable to contact you, we will issue a refund in the same form of payment originally used for the purchase.  Additional shipping charges may apply if the package is returned to us due to an incorrect address.  Our customer service staff will try and reach you and correct the problem.  Once the address is corrected we will reship the package.
Most of our shipping carriers make three attempts to deliver a package.  It is generally up to the discretion of the driver to determine if a signature is required.  If the driver feels it is best to obtain a signature and no one is present to accept the delivery, the package may be returned to us.
If a gift recipient is not expecting a gift, they may refuse the package if they believe it was sent to them in error.  If you still want to send these items, you may want to let the recipient know that a surprise is on the way.
If shipping outside the continental U.S.  we will contact you regarding freight charges before we ship.  The recipient must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination.  The recipient is liable for any import taxes, customs duties, additional fees for customs clearance or other import fees which are levied after the shipment leaves our facility.  We are not responsible for any delays caused by the Customs clearance policies and as these fees and policies vary greatly we cannot predict any delays or  the amount of any such fees.
APO and FPO addresses are generally shipped Priority Mail.  Thank you for your service.
