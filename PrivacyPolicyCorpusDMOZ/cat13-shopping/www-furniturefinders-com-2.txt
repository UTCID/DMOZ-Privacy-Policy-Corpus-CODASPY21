Each time you use or cause access to the FurnitureFinders.com web site ("the

("Terms" or "these Terms"). The Site is owned and operated
by SurplusFinders.com, Inc. (hereafter referred to as "FurnitureFinders").
FurnitureFinders reserves the
right to make changes to our Site, these Terms, or the policies incorporated
herein by reference, with or without notice. Therefore, it is recommended that
you regularly visit this page and familiarize yourself with the latest version
of these Terms. Your continued use of our Site will signify your acceptance of
any revised Terms. These Terms may not be otherwise be amended, except in
writing, by both you and FurnitureFinders.
1. Use of Site Contents
The contents
of our Site, including but not limited to text, software, photographs, graphics,
illustrations, artwork, video, music, sound, names, logos, trademarks, service
marks, data, and other material ("Content") are protected by copyright
and other laws in both the United States and elsewhere. The Content includes
both content owned or controlled by FurnitureFinders and content owned or
controlled by third parties and licensed to FurnitureFinders. FurnitureFinders
authorizes you to view and download a single copy of the Content on the site
solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You may not sell or modify the
Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform, distribute, or otherwise use
the Content in any way for any public or commercial purpose without the written
permission of FurnitureFinders. FurnitureFinders' trademarks may not be used in
connection with any product or service that is not FurnitureFinders', in any
manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that
disparages or discredits FurnitureFinders. As a condition of your use of this
site, you warrant that you will not use this site for any purpose that is
unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices.
2. Our Service
Our web site and the services provided to you on and through our web site are on
an "AS IS" basis. You agree that FurnitureFinders exclusively reserves
the right and may, at any time and without notice and any liability to you,
modify or discontinue this web site and its services or delete the data you
provide, whether temporarily or permanently. We shall have no responsibility or
liability for the timeliness, deletion, failure to store, inaccuracy, or
improper delivery of any data or information.
3. Membership / Access Eligibility
Our website and its services are available only to, and may only be used by,
individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without
limiting the foregoing, our services are not available to children (persons
under the age of 18) or to temporarily or indefinitely suspended
FurnitureFinders members. If you are under the age of 18, you can use this Site
only in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or legal
guardians. If you do not qualify, please do not use our Site. Further, your
FurnitureFinders account (including feedback) and Member ID may not be
transferred or sold to another party. If you are registering as a business
entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind the entity to these
Terms.
4. Registration / Your Account
You may browse the Site for free and without
registering. However, you must register on the Site ("Registration")
to access and use certain services ("Services" or "our
Services"). During Registration you will be asked to create an account
("Your Account") to identify yourself in future visits to the Site.
You will be asked to provide information such as your name, address, telephone
number, and email address. All of the information that you provide during
Registration is collected according to the terms of our Privacy Policy. It is
your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of Your Account ID and
Password and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur
under Your Account. You may not transfer, assign or sell Your Account (including
rating and feedback) to any third party.
PLEASE NOTE: You must provide accurate and current information to us. If you
provide any information that is false, misleading, inaccurate, not current or
incomplete during registration or otherwise, FurnitureFinders has the right to
suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use
of the service (or any portion thereof). Any activity that is illegally carried
on within the site will be reported to the appropriate federal, state or local
authorities.
5. Fees and Charges
Any fees and charges for using our site or specific
services will be shown for your review prior to your use. You agree that you are
responsible for paying all fees, including any and all applicable sales, income,
excise, import, export, VAT and other taxes or duties associated with using our
Service and the Site.
We reserve the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently,
some or all of our Services at any time with or without notice. In the event we
introduce a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch
of the service. We may also choose to temporarily lower the fees for our
Services for promotional events (for example, free listing days), and such
changes are effective when we post information about the promotional event on
the Site. Additionally, we may change our fee policy and the fees for our
Services at any time and in our sole discretion. Our changes to the fees are
effective after we post the changes on our Site.
6. FurnitureFinders is Only a Venue
Our Site acts as an open marketplace for
users to buy, sell, rent and negotiate the purchase and sale of goods and
services with other users. FurnitureFinders only enables communication between
buyers and sellers. FurnitureFinders is not involved in any transaction between
buyers and sellers who use our Site, and FurnitureFinders does not actually sell
such products or services, nor handle any goods physically. FurnitureFinders
does not control the behavior of members on the Site or the information provided
by other members that is made available through our Site. As a result,
FurnitureFinders does not guarantee or endorse the authenticity, quality,
safety, or legality of any items offered or sold, the truth or accuracy of any
listings, or the ability of sellers to sell items or of buyers to buy items.
Inventory is subject to change without notice, and we
cannot assure that all transactions will be completed. Additionally
FurnitureFinders does not guarantee the ability or intent of members to fulfill
their obligations in any transactions. Because user authentication on the
Internet is difficult, FurnitureFinders cannot and does not confirm each
member's purported identity. There are also risks that you assume when dealing
with underage persons or people otherwise acting under false pretenses. You
agree that all of these risks are borne by you, and not FurnitureFinders.
7. Listing Restrictions
FurnitureFinders prohibits the listing or sale of any
item that is illegal to sell under any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or
regulation. It is your responsibility to sell only legal goods and services and
you must make sure that what you list for sale on the site is legal and conforms
to all the legal requirements of your local, state, provincial, federal or
foreign law and regulations.
8. Selling / Posting
Sellers must have the legal authority to sell, rent or
provide the goods and services that you are listing on our Site. Sellers must
describe your item and all terms of transaction in your listing. If a user buys
your item, you are legally obligated to complete the transaction unless (i) the
transaction is prohibited by law or these Terms, (ii) the buyer materially
modifies the terms and conditions of the buyer's offer, or (iii) a typographical
error exists in the listing information which materially affects the terms of
sale. You are also responsible for payment of all FurnitureFinders fees.
9. User Information
"User Information" is defined as any and all
information or data you provide to FurnitureFinders or other users during the
Registration, post, sale, buy or any other process, and through any interactive
feature of the system, including email. You represent and warrant that Your User
Information (i) is not false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; (ii) is not
fraudulent and does not involve the sale of counterfeit or stolen items; (iii)
does not infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret
or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (iv) does not
violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including without limitation
those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition,
anti-discrimination or false advertising); (v) is not defamatory, libelous,
unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing; (vi) is not obscene and does not
contain child pornography; (vii) does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses,
worms, time bombs, bots or other computer programming routines that are intended
to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or
expropriate any system, data or personal information; (viii) does not create
liability for FurnitureFinders nor cause FurnitureFinders to lose (in whole or
in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers; and (ix) does not link
directly or indirectly to another web site. Furthermore, you may not list any
item on our Site (or consummate any transaction that was initiated using our
Service) that, by paying to us the listing fee or the final value fee, could
cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or
that violates our current listing restrictions. You agree not to make use of any
other member's User Information other than as necessary to complete any
transactions in which you and the subject of the User Information are involved.
10. Links to Other Sites
This site may contain hyperlinks to sites operated by
parties other than FurnitureFinders. Such hyperlinks are provided for your
reference only. FurnitureFinders does not control such sites and is not
responsible for their contents. FurnitureFinders' inclusion of hyperlinks to
such sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites or any
association with their operators, and FurnitureFinders makes no representations
or warranties with respect to such sites.
11. Limited License
You agree to grant
and hereby do grant FurnitureFinders a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers) right and
license to exercise all copyright and publicity rights You have, in any existing
or future media, known or unknown, in (i) Your User Information, (ii) the
material or user data displayed in Your listings, (iii) Your Member ID, and (iv)
the geographic location and description of any item listed, sold or bought by
You on the Site, to the extent that the exercise of such rights would not
violate the policies outlined on the Site's Privacy Policy.
12. Use Restrictions
Our Services may be used only for lawful purposes.
Transmission, posting, distribution or storage of material or conduct in
violation of any applicable local, state, provincial, federal or foreign law or
regulation is strictly prohibited. This includes without limitation any
unauthorized use of material protected by patent, copyright, trademark or other
intellectual property right, material that is obscene, defamatory or libelous,
constitutes an illegal threat, violates rights of privacy or publicity or
violates export control laws. You agree to comply with any applicable laws,
statutes, ordinances and regulations ("Laws") regarding your use of
the Site and our Services and the contractual obligations related to your buying
and selling activities. You agree not to use the Site in any manner that
violates, or proposes a transaction, which if consummated, would violate any
Laws, expose FurnitureFinders to civil or criminal liability, or violates these
Terms. You agree that you are solely responsible for obtaining all necessary
licenses and permissions necessary for your transactions and for verifying that
other Site users with whom you transact do the same.
You agree that you will use any information available on our Site, or any
information you learn about any buyer, seller or members of our online
community solely for the purpose of buying or selling office furniture.
Usage of any and all data obtained directly or indirectly through our
site for any
purpose other than previously stated, including but not limited to,
solicitation of services, copying of any source code or published text or images,
spam, and selling of contact information to third parties, will be considered in
violation of the terms of this agreement.
13. Content Policy
You agree not to post any Offensive Content on the Site or
post any links or URL's (web addresses) to sites containing Offensive Content.
"Offensive Content" includes, without limitation, words, images,
sounds or other content which: (i) is profane, obscene or involves child
pornography; (ii) denigrates a class of people because of their race, religion,
country of origin, sexual orientation or gender; (iii) depicts violent or
criminal acts, perpetrators or victims of violence or crime, or seeks to incite
violence or crime; (iv) relates or pertains to any "hate group," i.e.,
groups that are organized in part to promote the oppression of or assert the
supremacy of any class of people; or (v) contains defamatory or libelous
statements or unlawfully disparaging remarks or threats.
14. Intellectual Property and Rights of Publicity
You agree not to use the
Site in any manner which violates, or proposes a transaction which, if
consummated, would violate the trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, trade
dress, publicity or privacy rights or other proprietary rights of
FurnitureFinders or any third party. You agree not to link to any third party's
web site or file on that web site without that party's permission. You agree
that you will not use any automatic or manual process to monitor or copy any
portion of the Site without FurnitureFinders' prior written permission.
15. Breach
Without limiting other remedies, we may limit your activity,
immediately remove your bids or item listings, warn our community of your
actions, issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate
your membership and refuse to provide our services to you if: (a) you breach
these Terms or the documents it incorporates by reference; (b) we are unable to
verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that
your actions may cause financial loss or legal liability for you, our members or
FurnitureFinders.
16. Release
Because we are not involved in the actual physical transaction
between buyers and sellers, in the event that You have a dispute with one or
more members, You release FurnitureFinders and (as applicable) its officers,
directors, employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries, partners and affiliates
from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed,
arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If You are a
California resident, You waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says:
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing this release,
which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor."
17. Waiver of Claims
By using the Site or the Services, you signify your
agreement to and do thereby waive all claims which have not been filed but may
have accrued against FurnitureFinders or its officers, directors, employees,
agents, parents, subsidiaries, partners and affiliates prior to or as of the
date of said posting, regardless of the gravity of the action, whether in law or
equity, and such claims are forever barred. Subject to Section 18 (Release), the
foregoing does not apply to claims that have already been filed and are still
pending in the proper forum as specified below.
18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
YOU AGREE THAT USE OF OUR SERVICE IS AT YOUR
SOLE RISK. THE SITE AND OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS
AVAILABLE" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. FURNITUREFINDERS
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND
NONINTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SITE OR SERVICES. Some states do not
allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not
apply to you.
FURNITUREFINDERS MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL SATISFY YOUR
REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT OUR SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR
FREE, OR VIRUS FREE. NOR DOES FURNITUREFINDERS MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE
RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SITE OR OUR SERVICE OR AS TO
THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT OBTAINING ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL AND/OR
GOODS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK
AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM ANY
TRANSACTION. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU
FROM FURNITUREFINDERS OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY
WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.
19. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
IN NO EVENT SHALL FURNITUREFINDERS OR ITS
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, PARTNERS AND
AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, (HOWSOEVER ARISING, INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, RESULTING
FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH (I) OUR SITE, SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, (II) THE
RECEIPT OF DATA, INFORMATION OR MESSAGES, (III) TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO
THROUGH OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES, OR (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR
ALTERATION OF USER'S TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, EVEN IF FURNITUREFINDERS HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY
SPECIFIED HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT
SHALL FURNITUREFINDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM THE
STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY. VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
REFERENCED IN THE SITE ARE PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS PURSUANT TO
AGREEMENTS OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN SUCH VENDORS AND THE END USER.
FURNITUREFINDERS DOES NOT SELL, RESELL OR LICENSE SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND
IN NO EVENT SHALL FURNITUREFINDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RELATED
TO SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL FURNITUREFINDERS BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION OR
TERMINATION OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER SUCH INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION OR
TERMINATION WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT, NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL, INADVERTENT OR
ADVERTENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL FURNITUREFINDERS'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD
PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR CAUSE OF ACTION EXCEED THE LESSER OF (I) THE
DOLLAR VALUE OF THE ACTUAL LOSS OR (II) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). Some
jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of warranties or of
liability for incidental or consequential damages so some of the foregoing above
may not apply to you.
20. Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold FurnitureFinders and
(as applicable) its officers, directors, employees, agents, parents,
subsidiaries, partners and affiliates harmless against any and all claims made
by or liabilities to any third party resulting from any activities conducted
under Your Account and/or your use or misuse of the Site, including, but not
limited to, posting content on the Site, entering into transactions with other
Site users, contacting others as a result of their posting(s) on the Site,
infringing a third party's intellectual property or other rights, failing to
deliver goods or payment to other Site users or otherwise arising out of Your
breach of any Terms of these Terms.
21. Arbitration
FurnitureFinders is not liable under these Terms for any
injury you may suffer or allege to suffer as a User of this Site. In the event,
however, that You wish to assert any claim against FurnitureFinders for any
purpose whatsoever, You expressly agree that such dispute will be settled by
binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
American Arbitration Association and that the arbitration will take place in the
County of Los Angeles, California. You agree that notwithstanding any statute or
law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
use of the Service or Site or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year
after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Legal action
taken by FurnitureFinders to collect fees and/or recover damages for, or obtain
an injunction relating to, the Site operations, intellectual property, and our
Services shall not be subject to the foregoing restrictions.
22. Notice
Any notices given pursuant to these Terms that are directed to
FurnitureFinders shall be given by postal mail to: FurnitureFinders, Inc. P.O.
Box 3605, Manhattan Beach, California 90266, Attn: Legal. Any notice from
FurnitureFinders that is directed to you shall be delivered to the mailing

of notice sent via postal mail, three (3) business days after the date of
mailing. FurnitureFinders may also give notice of changes to these Terms or
other matters related to FurnitureFinders by displaying notices to users on the
Site.
23. Language
It is the express intent of the parties that these Terms and any
related documents be drawn up and executed in the English language.
24. General
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws
principles, as if formed by between California residents. The United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to
these Terms. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define,
limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of any section. If any part of
these Terms is deemed invalid or void, that part of the Agreement shall be
deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of
the remaining conditions. FurnitureFinders' failure to act with respect to a
breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to
subsequent or similar breaches. You and FurnitureFinders are independent
contractors. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or
franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.
