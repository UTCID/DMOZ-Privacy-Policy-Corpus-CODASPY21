These Terms of Use state the legally binding terms with respect to your use of the Site. Spectrum reserves the right to modify or change the Terms of Use at any time without prior notice to you.

The most current version of the Terms of Use can be reviewed by clicking on the "TERMS" or "TERMS OF USE" hypertext link located at the bottom of the main page of the Site. Your continued entry to and/or use of the Site after Spectrum posts any revised Terms of Use constitutes your agreement to any such revised Terms of Use.
1. General Use and Restrictions.

Conditioned upon, and subject to, your strict compliance with the Terms of Use, Spectrum grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to enter and use the Site to view information, use the Services and for other purposes expressly permitted by Spectrum in writing on the Site.
You agree not to enter or use the Site for any purpose that is prohibited by the Terms of Use or is otherwise unlawful. You further agree to comply with all applicable U.S. laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, contracts and applicable licenses regarding your use of the Site.

1.2. Information Provided. If you provide any information to us, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. Use of this Site is governed by our Privacy Policy which we encourage you to review by clicking on the hypertext link located at the bottom of the main page of this Site.

2.0 General.
2.1 Account and Password.
If we issue an account to use the Services to you (an "Account"), we will also issue a username and/or initial password for such Account to you (each user of the Service that is issued an Account shall be referred to herein as a "Registered User"). The portions of the Site available to the general public and to Registered Users may vary. You may not be able to access all features or use all Services on the Site if you do not become a Registered User. You may not authorize any third party to enter and/or use your Account on their behalf. Accordingly, you agree to protect your username and password by, among other things, keeping your username and password confidential. If, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation, you allow another party to use your username and/or password to access your Account, you will be responsible for all use by the party using your Account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Spectrum of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session.
2.2 Submissions and User Generated Content.

The Site may contain bulletin boards, chat groups, forums and other interactive areas that allow users to express their opinions and post information and/or other materials (collectively, "User Generated Content"). We do not monitor all of the User Generated Content posted or transmitted by users and third party information providers. You may have the opportunity to answer surveys, ratings and questions posted on the Site by a Spectrum contractor. If you choose to respond, you will actually answer the survey, ratings and questions on the contractor's site and will be subject to the contractor's terms and conditions of use when you submit your responses. The contractor's terms of use can be accessed by clicking the designated link on the Site.
2.2.	Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers and users, are those of the third party and not of Spectrum.

You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such third party User Generated Content is at your sole risk.
2.3.	Spectrum may, in its sole discretion, edit and/or remove any User Generated Content you submit to the Site. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Spectrum may edit or remove any User Generated Content you submit to the Site that Spectrum, in its sole discretion, deems abusive, defamatory, obscene, unlawful, or otherwise unacceptable or in violation of these Terms of Use, and you waive any moral rights you may have with respect to changes in the User Generated Content. We are not responsible for maintaining your posted User Generated Content and we may, in our sole discretion, delete or destroy it at any time with no liability or obligation to you.

You understand that personal and other information (e.g., username, e-mail address, phone number) that you post on our Site is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others. To protect your safety, please use your best judgment when posting information. We particularly discourage divulging personal phone numbers and addresses or other information that can be used to identify or locate you.
4. Linking and Third Party Dealings.
4.1. Links to External Sites. Spectrum may provide hyperlinks to other web sites and Internet resources operated by parties other than Spectrum. Spectrum has no control over such sites and resources or their privacy policies or terms of use and Spectrum's policies and terms no longer govern.

4.2. Linking to the Site. Subject to the further provisions of this Section 4, Spectrum welcomes links to the Site from other web sites. However, if Spectrum demands that you not link to the Site, or any portion of the Site, you agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, link to the Site or such portion of the Site as directed in our demand, at any time after such demand is made.
5. Intellectual Property.

6. Parental Controls. Pursuant to Title 47, United States Code, Section 230(d) as amended, Spectrum hereby notifies you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available which may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.

9. Indemnification. You hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Spectrum and its affiliates, officers, members, directors, employees, shareholders, information providers, suppliers, contractors and licensees (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liability and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach, or alleged breach, of any of the Terms of Use by you.
10. Limitation of Liability.
10.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SPECTRUM, ITS LICENSORS OR THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES BE LIABLE OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE TERMS OF USE, THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT. Subject to the below provision, in no event shall Spectrum's total liability to you for all damages exceed $10.00.
10.2 NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL BE UNDERSTOOD TO LIMIT SPECTRUM'S LIABILITY (1) FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH (a) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE TERMS OF USE, THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT or b) CAUSED BY SPECTRUM'S OWN NEGLIGENT, INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL MISCONDUCT OR (2) FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY SPECTRUM'S FAILURE TO ADHERE TO COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
11. Modifications to the Site. For the avoidance of doubt, Spectrum may modify, suspend, discontinue and/or restrict the use of all or any portion of the Site including, without limitation, the Services and Content, at any time for any reason (or for no reason) and without notice or liability.
12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. The Site is hosted on servers located in the United States and is intended to be viewed by residents of the United States. Although the information on this Site is accessible to users outside of the United States, the information on this Site pertaining to Spectrum products is intended for use only by residents of the United States. Other countries may have laws and regulatory requirements that differ from those of the United States. This Site links to other sites produced by our affiliates or for our various brands, some of which are outside of the United States. Those sites may have information that is appropriate only to that particular originating country or geographic region. Spectrum reserves the right to limit provision of our products and/or Services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction and/or to limit the quantities or any products and/or Services we provide. Any offer for any product or Service made on this Site is void where prohibited.
The Terms of Use shall be deemed to be agreed to by you in Madison, Wisconsin. The Terms of Use, and all matters arising out of or relating to the Terms of Use, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin and the United States, without giving effect to the conflict of law provisions thereof and excluding any application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in Madison, Wisconsin unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts sitting in Madison, Wisconsin. You hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which you may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
13. General Provisions. If any provision of the Terms of Use is declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable or void, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified in accordance with the applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intention of the applicable provision, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. Section headings are provided for convenience only, and shall not be read or interpreted to restrict any provision contained in the Terms. No right or remedy conferred by the Terms of Use is exclusive of any other right or remedy conferred herein or by law or in equity; rather, all of such rights and remedies are cumulative of every other such right or remedy and may be exercised concurrently or separately from time-to-time. Spectrum may provide notice to you relating to the Terms of Use by sending an e-mail to your last known e-mail address, if any, your last known postal address, if any, or posting a notice on the Site, and any such notice shall be deemed given and received on the earlier of the day it is sent to you or the day it is posted on the Site. A printed version of the Terms of Use and of any notices given to you in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The failure of Spectrum to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of the Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If Spectrum brings any suit against you to enforce the Terms of Use or otherwise in connection with your use of and/or entry onto the Site, you agree that if Spectrum prevails in such suit Spectrum shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses incurred in such suit including reasonable attorneys' fees.
14. Forward-looking Statements.
This site may contain forward-looking statements which may involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these statements as a result of changes in external competitive market factors, unanticipated changes in the company's industry, or economy in general, as well as various other factors, including those discussed herein and those set forth in Spectrum's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock price performance shown on the stock quotes on the Site is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.
