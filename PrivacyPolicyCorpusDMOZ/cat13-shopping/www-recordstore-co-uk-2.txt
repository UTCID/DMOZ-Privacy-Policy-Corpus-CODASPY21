Users of sites in the European Economic Erea
This section of this Privacy Policy applies only if you use the Site from a
country that is a
Member State of the European Economic Area, and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.
Legal Basis for Data Processing: We process personal data for
the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal
basis to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the
performance of the contract between you and us (for example, to provide you
with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may
use the Site); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to
comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to
law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to
manage our relationship with you and to improve the Site); and based on
consent by our customers (for example, to communicate with you about our
products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may
subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using preference settings in emails
or on our Sites, using our
Privacy Office Inquiry Form, or emailing us as set out in the Contact section)
without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
withdrawal.
We may use automated decision making technologies, including profiling, to
support our data processing activities. Our automated decision making
capabilities include logic that attempts to identify artists, music,
communications, products, or offers that we believe may interest you. By using
this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions with UMG and UMG
artists. For you, this means that you may see online advertisements, direct
marketing communications (if you have subscribed), or other advertising or
marketing messages or special offers based on your activity on our Sites or
interactions with UMG Companies or our third party partners.
In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal data for
processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you to
use all the features of the Site.
International transfers
Our sharing your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, may
involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar
degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring, where required by law, at
least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
transferring personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
transferring personal data to the United States to an entity if they are
part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection
to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to request a copy of
relevant safeguards by contacting UMG as described in the
Contact section.
