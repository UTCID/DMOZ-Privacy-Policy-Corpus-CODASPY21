Q: What are Body Circle Design's material quality standards?
A: We are an APP (Association of Professional Piercers) Corporate Sponsor. We use 316 LVM ASTM-F-138 implant grade stainless steel. This is the highest quality implant grade stainless steel available today. The “L” refers to the low carbon content. The “VM” means vacuum melted. This stainless steel is produced in a vacuum environment. This method eliminates dust particles and any other debris from forming with the stainless. All our jewelry is free of nicks, scratches, burrs, and polishing compound.
