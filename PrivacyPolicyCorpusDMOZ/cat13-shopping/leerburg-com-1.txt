Last updated November 27th, 2017
Modern information and communication technologies play a fundamental role in the activities of an organization like Leerburg Enterprises, Inc. We are based in the USA.

Newsletter Policy
Leerburg Enterprises, Inc. sends out a newsletter. The following people will receive this newsletter unless they opt-out and chose not to receive it:
Customers who purchase products from Leerburg Enterprises, Inc.
People who write and ask that one of our catalogs be sent through the United States Postal Service.

We do not sell our email lists or mailing lists.
I want to make it very clear that Leerburg will never sell customer information to other online data collection companies. Not ever! We have been asked many times to rent our mailing list. We will never do that, much less pass on customer information to a third party.
I take the stewardship of our customer's personal information very seriously. I don't want my personal information shared with someone who is influenced by the highest bidder, and I assume our customers feel the same way.
