The following provisions specifically relate to the b2c
portion of the SophioSoft.com Site. All other provisions
of this Agreement apply to the b2c as well:
Order Acceptance
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order
confirmation does not constitute SOPHIO's acceptance of
your order for products or services offered through the SophioSoft.com Site,
nor does it constitute confirmation of SOPHIO's offer to
sell you a particular product or service. SOPHIO
reserves the right at any time after receipt of your
order to accept, decline, or limit your order for any
reason. Your credit card will not be charged until SOPHIO
has accepted your order and prepared your order for
shipment or for download. All orders placed over
$2000.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an
acceptable method of payment, as established by our
credit and fraud avoidance department. We may require
additional verifications or information before accepting
any order. Price and availability of products and
services offered through the SophioSoft.com Site are
subject to change without prior notice. To the extent we
provide information on the availability of SOPHIO
Products or products and services provided by third
party vendors, suppliers, publishers, and manufacturers
(collectively Third Party Products), we
attempt to be as accurate as possible. However, SOPHIO
does not warrant that product descriptions, product
availability or other information on the SophioSoft.com Site
is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
SOPHIO will not be liable for any lack of availability
of SOPHIO Products or Third Party Products you may order
through the SophioSoft.com Site. If your purchase order
or any other communication with SOPHIO contains
provisions inconsistent with this Agreement, this
Agreement will prevail.

discounts, returns, and other customer services for all
products offered through the SophioSoft.com Site will be

E-Store.

secure. This means that any information you send us is
protected by encryption. All messages are sent in an
encrypted "digital envelope" and authenticated
to verify the identity of both the sender and the
receiver of the transaction. However, no connection to
the Internet is completely secure. If you experience
fraudulent use of your credit card as a result of
shopping with SOPHIO, notify your credit card company in
accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. Most
companies will either cover all of the fraudulent
purchases or hold you liable for a maximum of $50.
Should your credit card company discover credit card
fraud and hold you liable for some portion of the
unauthorized charges, and provided the purchase was made
through our secure server, SOPHIO will reimburse you for
the maximum liability of $50. You can always order
products or services by telephone or fax. Call us at
1-603-436-6868.
Limited Warranty
SOPHIO offers through the b2c both SOPHIO Products
and Third Party Products. Certain SOPHIO Products and
Third Party Products may be subject to End User License
Agreements in addition to this Agreement. In the event
of a conflict between any provision of a SOPHIO End User
License Agreement and this Agreement, the provision of
the SOPHIO End User License Agreement will control as to
the particular conflicting provision.

will, at SOPHIO's sole option and without charge,
replace the SOPHIO Product if it fails to conform to the
product's accompanying documentation in effect at the
time of shipment or download, or refund the purchase
price of the SOPHIO Product, provided that SOPHIO will
not have any liability whatsoever for any damage to or
defect in a SOPHIO Product resulting directly or
indirectly from your abuse or misuse of the product. For

Product to SOPHIO, at your expense, any time within the
Warranty Period for a refund of the purchase price.

the Warranty Period, SOPHIO will provide technical
support to you for SOPHIO Products, without charge. If
you wish to purchase a technical support package beyond

but the support will be governed by a separate Support

ordered through the b2c are subject to the terms and
conditions of the End User License Agreement between you
