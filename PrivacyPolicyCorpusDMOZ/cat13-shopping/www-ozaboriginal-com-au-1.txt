About Us
Welcome to OzAboriginal Pty. Ltd.!
OzAboriginal was formed in 1992. Initially located in a warehouse that was primarily used for the distribution of Indigenous products, the organisation began to grow as new skills were learnt and a clear identity was formed. Local Indigenous artists joined the organisation that did traditional painting on artefacts, canvas and giftware. OzAboriginal, provides meaningful employment to local artists whilst allowing them the opportunities to develop their own artistic and commercial profile.
