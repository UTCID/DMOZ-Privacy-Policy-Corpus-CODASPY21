Earn Free/Reduced Shipping on Orders as Low as $35.00 to USA and Canada!
Read More...New, Improved Free Shipping OfferSave on any shipping method with any order over just $35.00!*Free Shipping
With some exceptions (see below), when merchandise totals $35.00 or more, we offer a discount applied against your shipping cost on any available shipping method.
For many orders shipping to the continental US, this will provide free, or nearly free, shipping. For bulky and/or very heavy orders, as well as orders shipping to Alaska, Hawaii or Canada, the shipping will be nicely discounted.
Where applicable, currently only on Fedex express, ground, and home delivery services, surcharges for rural and/or residential delivery will be added after the discount is applied.
Free/discounted shipping is available on packages delivered within the USA and Canada for retail customers who place an order through the website.
Free shipping is not available for orders placed by phone or by
mail.
Free or discounted shipping is not available to wholesale customers, however, we do everything we can to keep your shipping costs low.
Charges reflect the actual shipping cost, not a percentage of the sale.
We also avoid shipping multiple boxes whenever possible.
*Exceptions
Any portion of an order paid for by My Rewards points, any discount coupon offer, or any discounted merchandise, will not be included in the order total used to calculate the shipping discount.
If you are a registered customer and you have points available to redeem, please be sure your
total of full price items will exceed $35.00 after your points are redeemed, if you want the best deal on shipping.
