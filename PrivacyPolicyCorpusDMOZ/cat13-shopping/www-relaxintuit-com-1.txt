It is each individual’s responsibility to use the Internet responsibly and consider the source of content, exercise good judgment and consult with appropriate licensed professionals to help make decisions specific to you. (FYI: Secure pages on any website are indicated by “https” in the address bar on that page, and/or a small lock or other indicator, appearing in your browser.)
