SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Commitment to Helping Combat Human Trafficking, Child or Involuntary Labor and Worker Abuse While bebe does not own any of its own manufacturing facilities, bebe believes it is very important to continually try to assess, understand and, where needed and appropriate, positively affect the working conditions which exist for those people who work on bebe product. Part of our efforts in this regard are designed to help ensure that contract factories which work on bebe product are compliant with local labor laws and that we are doing our part to combat child labor, slavery and human trafficking. Such efforts include, but are not limited to, the following:
Conducting routine audits of contract factories through the use of a hired and experienced outside third party--these audits focus on employee working conditions, specifically (among other concerns): working environment, human rights, worker age documentation, wage issues, working hours, safety and discrimination;
bebe is a participating member of the United States government's Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, which is designed to certify and validate members' physical supply chain safety and documented processes;
Implementing a procedure for the inbound transportation and receipt of international shipments that is in accordance with the United States government's Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, which consists of routine tracking and inspection for contraband and human trafficking; In addition to our trucking companies using great diligence and reporting during their cargo inspection, we also train our own distribution team members on imported cargo inspection, which we also perform periodically during the year simultaneous to, and in conjunction with, the trucking companies' inspection;
bebe vendor suppliers are asked to sign our purchase agreement (which includes acknowledgment of bebe's Vendor Business Ethics Policy and bebe's Vendor Manual), which (among other requirements) requires their compliance with all local labor laws, forbids the use of child and involuntary labor of any kind, forbids the use of physical or mental abuse, requires they are subject to our routine social compliance audits and requires that their contracting facilities are also similarly bound to the above requirements; and bebe FOB suppliers are required to complete a detailed Security Questionnaire and are provided with a Best Practices Manual (both relating to cargo security) during their vendor on-boarding process.
If any social compliance audits required of our vendors' contract factories report a failure or a need for corrective action, bebe and its vendor follow up with the offending supplier to ensure that the problem has been remedied. If any such failure is not remedied, bebe will not work with the offending factory/supplier until remedied. Both bebe and its auditing contractor maintain updated records, and for a certain period of time, in order to help ensure the integrity of this process.
bebe also encourages its employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management to obtain training on how to mitigate risk associated with human trafficking and slavery. Such training includes attending supply chain seminars and webinars offered by independent companies.
CONFLICT MINERALS POLICY
bebe is working to ensure compliance with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act"). The purpose the Act is to address and eliminate the violent conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighboring adjoining countries (the "Covered Countries") where armed groups are using local mining proceeds to fund regional conflict and engage in human rights abuses. The Act currently defines Conflict Minerals as: columbite-tantalite (tantalum), cassiterite (tin), wolframite (tungsten), and gold ("Conflict Minerals"). This list may expand to include other minerals or their derivatives, as determined by the U.S. Secretary of State.
Pursuant to the Act as well as other related rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), publicly traded companies, like bebe, are required to annually report to the SEC, the presence of any Conflict Minerals, originating in the Covered Countries, in the products it manufactures or contracts to manufacture and whether the Conflict Minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of the products. bebe is working on a due diligence program, consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, to meet these regulatory requirements.
bebe expects the vendors who are part of our supply chain to comply with our due diligence program by providing complete and timely responses to surveys and other inquiries. bebe encourages those involved in our supply chain to adopt similar policies and systems to help eliminate illegal mineral trade, regional conflict in the Covered Countries, and human rights abuses. bebe is committed to sourcing our materials from companies who share our values of social responsibility and is working diligently to ensure full compliance with the Act.
As recommended by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, bebe has established a grievance mechanism in the event any conflict mineral issues arise. When seeking guidance and/or reporting concerns, the following contacts and reporting option is available to you:

946 W. 17th St. Costa Mesa, CA 92627
Alternatively, you may report information via the Compliance Hotline at 866-232-3199.
