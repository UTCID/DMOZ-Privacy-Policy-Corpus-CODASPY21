Our Clients
I am so glad I discovered the lightbox and strongly recommend it to anyone who suffers from Seasonal Affective Disorder!
Heidi GWest Grove, PA
Several months ago, I was seeing a sleep therapist for fatigue and "unrestful" sleep. She suggested I try a light box. I am very happy with my purchase.
T.S.Minneapolis, MN
This is our family's third winter using our lightbox. We are extremely happy we decided to purchase this lightbox!
The Ricker FamilyJuneau, AK
For such a small light, it emits a lot of light, which makes it easier in the morning. I would definitely recommend buying one!
Brooke CDuluth, MN
As an added bonus the light box is a fabulous make-up light. Since moving my light box and using it every day, I feel great!
Kathy RKingston, MA
I have had great benefit from daily use of my light box. Just having it on for 20 to 30 minutes a day has helped improve my mood and energy.
Michael S. Langan, MD FACPColumbus, OH
Since getting my light box, the harsh winters here haven't seemed so dreary, and my mood hasn't had the usual winter 'dip' I used to have.
Ben MLakewood, OH
I was surprised at how easy it was to use the Aurora LightPad MAX. It's small and compact, making it easy for me to use anywhere in my house.
Ryan M.Seattle, WA
My doctor suggested I purchased a SAD light box and I'm so happy to have found the Aurora Lightpad mini. I use it every day and call it my happy light.
Audry BellPittsburgh, PA
I bought the lightpad to help with my winter blues. We had a long and dark winter and I was ready to try anything to make a positive impact.
