Atlanta Supply respects your privacy.
Email Privacy
Your email address is used only for communication from Atlanta Supply Co. We do not sell, rent, or loan any identifiable information regarding specific customers to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.
Secure Socket Layer Encryption
We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly difficult to decipher code, which is processed immediately. In addition, we employ an outside company (Control Scan) to "audit" our security and make sure it is trustworthy.
Our SSL certificate is provided by Godaddy, an industry leader.
Security and Privacy Measures
Atlanta Supply Co. Shopping Security ensures that your credit card information is safe and your privacy respected. We protect your shopping experience by:
Utilizing industry standard SSL Technology
Hosting Our Site on Secure Servers
Our site is PCI Compliant
Allowing you to opt out of any online or traditional telemarketing efforts
Your Personal Information
We collect information so we can communicate about your order with us. We firmly believe it's your right to know what information we collect, how we use it, and what your options are. We do not sell, rent or loan any of your personal information with third parties.
At Atlanta Supply Co., whenever you provide any sensitive personal information, we encrypt it so that no one can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet. At this time, all information (such as your name and address) is safely stored behind a firewall. A firewall is a set of related programs that protects your information from users from other networks. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it each time you make a purchase or log in.
