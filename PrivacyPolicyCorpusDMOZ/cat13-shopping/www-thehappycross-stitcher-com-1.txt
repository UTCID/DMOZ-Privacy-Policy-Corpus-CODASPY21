PHOTO TO CHART
The Happy Cross Stitcher Photo to Chart service produces a cross stitch chart from a customer supplied image and as such will be a clear interpretation but not an exact pixel for pixel replica of your image. For example, fine detail such as facial lines or multiple hair colours may not chart easily - in a photograph these may be constructed of single or multiple pixels, where as a single cross-stitch is actually quite large in comparison.
Our charts are produced to the highest standard, however the final charting can only ever be as good as the image provided.
You will be informed if we think the image will not chart satisfactorily and you will be offered the opportunity to supply an alternate image for charting or alternatively a full refund, otherwise refunds will only be given if an error is made during the chart conversion process. Please note that we ask that you obtain permission to use a picture or image where copyright issues exist. We are converting images on your behalf and cannot be held liable for any copyright infringement.
