It affects your legal rights.  Any dispute of any kind between Calendars.com and you, including but not limited to any claim relating in any way to any advertisements, pricing, products or services sold or distributed by Calendars.com, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You acknowledge that use of this Site and/or purchase of any products or services from or through Calendars.com constitutes a transaction in interstate commerce.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement.  This arbitration agreement survives termination of these Terms. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Services as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide.  All arbitration proceeding will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. YOU AND CALENDARS.COM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE, GROUP OR CLASS ACTION OR ARBITRATION, OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless both you and Calendars.com agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, group or class proceeding. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Exclusive jurisdiction over and venue of any suit arising out of or relating to such action will be in the courts of Travis County, Texas.  These Terms of Use will be governed by Texas law, exclusive of any choice of law rules, except for the arbitration agreement, which is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.ADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONSIn addition to the policies and guidelines located throughout the Calendars.com Site, the following policies are incorporated into the Terms of Use:·       Return Policy·       Privacy Policy·       Submission Guidelines MISCELLANEOUSThese Terms of Use, including policies and information linked from or incorporated herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and Calendars.com with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements, and proposals with respect to the Site.
