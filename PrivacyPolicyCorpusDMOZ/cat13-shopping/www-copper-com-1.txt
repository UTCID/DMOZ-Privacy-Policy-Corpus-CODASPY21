COPPER CRM, INC.
TERMS OF SERVICE
Date of Last Revision: September 08, 2020
Summary of revisions to Copper’s Terms of Service effective as of September 03, 2020:
Data Protection Addendum. Copper previously entered into data protection addenda, which address how Copper processes, stores and shares certain personal information included in Customer Content, on an as-requested basis with its customers. In light of recent developments in data protection legal requirements, Copper’s Terms of Service has been updated to include the terms of our standard data protection addendum, so that these terms now automatically cover all personal information included in Customer Content that is subject to applicable data protection laws. (Section 4.4)Changes to Accounts. The Terms of Service now include language to make clear that any decrease to the number of Authorized Users or downgrade to the subscription level may only be made upon 30 days’ notice prior to the end of your subscription period. Any such change will go into effect in the subsequent subscription period. (Section 8.3)Account suspension. The Terms of Service have been revised to make clear that, while a Customer’s subscription has been suspended, he or she will be unable to utilize the Service or access and use Customer Content. (Section 8.4)This summary is provided for reference only, and does not modify or enlarge Copper’s and its customers’ respective rights and obligations, which shall be as set forth below in these Terms of Service.
____________________________________________________________________________Copper CRM, Inc. (“Copper”) provides the Service (as defined below) to Customer (as defined below) through the Site (as defined below), subject to this Terms of Service Agreement (“TOS”). By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS and Copper’s Privacy Policy (available at https://www.copper.com/privacy), which is incorporated by reference into this TOS. If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a Company, business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this TOS, including the Privacy Policy. As used in this TOS, “Customer” refers to you or the company, business or other legal entity on whose behalf you are entering into this TOS, as applicable, and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you must not accept this TOS and may not use the Service.
MODIFICATIONS. COPPER MAY CHANGE THIS TOS FROM TIME TO TIME. IF COPPER DOES THIS, COPPER WILL INDICATE IN TEXT APPENDED TO THIS PAGE THE DATE THIS TOS WAS LAST REVISED AND, IF APPLICABLE, COPPER WILL POST THE MATERIAL CHANGES TO THIS TOS ON THIS PAGE. COPPER WILL ALSO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO NOTIFY CUSTOMER, EITHER THROUGH THE SERVICE USER INTERFACE, IN AN EMAIL NOTIFICATION TO THE ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL PROVIDED BY CUSTOMER IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, OR THROUGH OTHER REASONABLE MEANS. ANY SUCH CHANGES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON THE EARLIER OF (A) CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SITE AND/OR SERVICE WITH ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHANGE, OR (B) FIFTEEN (15) DAYS AFTER CHANGES ARE POSTED. CUSTOMER’S CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER THE DATE ANY SUCH CHANGES BECOME EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER’S ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW TOS, PROVIDED THAT DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THIS TOS WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TOS IN PLACE AT THE TIME THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE DISPUTE OCCURRED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES (I) THAT CUSTOMER IS AGREEING TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ARISING HEREUNDER (AS DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL IN SECTION 12), AND THAT THE TERMS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE MODIFIED EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 12 AND (II) THAT COPPER MAY MODIFY THE SAFEGUARDS FROM TIME TO TIME (AS DEFINED BELOW) BUT SHALL NOT MATERIALLY REDUCE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SAFEGUARDS WITHOUT CUSTOMER’S CONSENT.

COPPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE, OR WILL WORK WITH OR NOT INTERRUPT OR DAMAGE CUSTOMER’S THIRD-PARTY SERVICE OR CUSTOMER’S CONTENT (INCLUDING ANY CONTENT CUSTOMER MAY STORE ON ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE). NO INFORMATION, ADVICE OR SERVICES OBTAINED BY CUSTOMER FROM COPPER OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS TOS. OUR LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE SERVICE, COPPER TECHNOLOGY OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.PaymentsFees. Except with respect to any “free trial” of the Service or as otherwise provided for in any related Order Form, Customer shall select a subscription level as part of Customer’s online initial or renewal subscription process, as applicable. Customer shall be responsible for the payment of any associated subscription fees in accordance with this TOS and Copper’s standard payment and billing policies. If Customer increases the number of Authorized Users during a Subscription Term, the fees for accounts for such new Authorized Users will be prorated over the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term, provided that Authorized Users added mid-month will be charged for the entire month. The pricing and payment terms applicable to any renewal Subscription Term will be the same as that during the prior Subscription Term unless Copper has provided Customer with notice of any change to the pricing and/or payment terms at least sixty (60) days before the end of such prior Subscription Term, in which case any such change will be effective upon the commencement of the following renewal Subscription Term.Payment Terms. Customer will pay all applicable fees in accordance with this TOS and, if applicable, any related Order Form. Except as otherwise specified in this TOS or, if applicable, any related Order Form, all payment obligations are final, non-cancelable and non-changeable, and all fees paid are non-refundable.Credit Card Payments. If Customer elects to pay fees by credit card, Customer agrees and warrants to Copper that the credit card information provided by Customer to Copper is, and will be maintained as, true, complete, accurate and up to date, and that Customer is authorized to use such payment instrument in connection with its subscription for the Service. Customer agrees to pay and hereby authorizes Copper to bill Customer’s credit card in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of this TOS and the applicable Order Form, if any, during the Subscription Term. Customer will not chargeback any amounts paid to Customer and will reimburse Copper for any chargeback fees associated with the foregoing.Taxes. Fees do not include any Taxes. Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes, excluding only taxes based on Copper’s net income. If Copper has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this TOS, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by Customer unless Customer provides Copper with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.Late Payments. Any late payments will be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% of the amount due (calculated on a monthly basis) or the maximum amount allowed by Applicable Law, whichever is less.Orders through Reseller. If Customer orders the Services from a Reseller, then, unless otherwise notified by Copper or the Reseller, (a) fees for the Services will be set between Customer and the Reseller, and any payments will be made directly to Reseller under the Reseller Agreement; (b) the remaining provisions in this Section 7 (Payments) will not apply to the Service; (c) all changes to Customers subscription, including cancellation and changes to the number of Authorized Users shall be made by contacting Reseller; and (d) Copper may share information concerning Customer’s account and subscription terms with Reseller.Term and TerminationTerm. Except as otherwise provided for in any related Order Form, Customer shall select a Subscription Term as part of its online initial or renewal subscription process, as the case may be.

Customer may terminate Customer’s subscription effective as of the last day of the Subscription Term ending soonest after the date that is thirty (30) days following the date of Customer’s valid termination of its account in accordance with the procedures set forth on the Site. Customer may terminate this TOS and all related Order Forms (i) upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Copper, if Copper has materially breached this TOS and such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period or (ii) immediately, if Copper becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. To be effective, any such notice must expressly state the reasons for the claimed breach in sufficient detail.Subscription Changes.Upgrades. If Customer chooses to upgrade its subscription plan level, increase its number of Authorized Users or add ancillary services during a Subscription Term, any incremental subscription fees associated with such upgrade or increase will be charged on a pro rated basis with respect to the remaining Subscription Term. In any future Subscription Term, Customer’s subscription fees will reflect any such upgrades and increases.Downgrades. If Customer chooses to downgrade its subscription plan level, reduce the number of Authorized Users or reduce its ancillary services for a subsequent Subscription Term, Customer must provide Copper with at least thirty (30) days notice, in accordance with the procedures set forth on the Site, prior to the end of its then current Subscription Term. Any such changes will go into effect in the subsequent Subscription Term.Termination and Suspension by Copper. Copper may modify, suspend or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) or Customer’s subscription to the Service, with or without cause, at any time immediately upon notice to Customer. For this purpose, “cause” shall include (i) if Customer does not accept and agree to be bound by any modification to this TOS, (ii) if Customer has materially violated this TOS, (iii) if Copper reasonably believes that Customer’s use of the Service may cause harm to Copper, the Service, the Site or other users of Copper’s products and services or (iv) if Customer becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. While Customer’s subscription is suspended, Customer shall be unable to utilize the Service or access or use Customer Content. Copper will use good faith efforts under the circumstances to provide reasonable notice to Customer prior to termination or suspension of Customer’s account by Copper pursuant to this Section 8.4.Effect of Termination. Except to the extent expressly set forth in Section 8.6, upon termination of this TOS for any reason, Customer will have no further right to access and use the Service or access to Customer Content. If this TOS is terminated by Copper for cause or by Customer other than pursuant to the second sentence of Section 8.2, Copper will be entitled to all of the fees due under this TOS for the entire Subscription Term. If this TOS is terminated by Copper without cause or by Customer pursuant to the second sentence of Section 8.2, Customer will be entitled to a refund of any prepaid but unused fees.Post-Termination Access to Customer Content. If this TOS is terminated other than by Copper for cause, then Customer may retrieve Customer Content from the Service during a thirty (30) day transition period commencing on the effective date of such termination (the “Transition Period”). If Customer retrieves Customer Content from the Service during the Transition Period, then Customer shall be responsible for, and shall have paid, all fees due under this TOS with respect to their Subscription Period and the Transition Period. This TOS will continue in full force and effect during the Transition Period solely to the extent necessary to allow Customer to retrieve Customer Content from the Service. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this Section, Copper has no obligation to archive or make available Customer Content after expiration or termination of this TOS.Survival. The following provisions will survive expiration or termination of this TOS for any reason: Sections 1.2, 1.3, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR EITHER PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT OR ANY DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM A BREACH BY CUSTOMER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 1.2 or 1.3 OF THIS TOS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) WILL THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS ORDER FORM OR THE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR (B) FOR ANY DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID (OR, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS FOR FEES DUE, PAYABLE) BY CUSTOMER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO CUSTOMER’S CLAIM OR, IF NO FEES APPLY, ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100) (THE “LIABILITY CAP”). THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TOS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS TOS. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT LIMIT CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS TOS. OUR LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO DIRECT OR INDIRECT LIABILITY TO YOU WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICE, COPPER TECHNOLOGY OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.Mutual Indemnification.Indemnification by Copper. Copper will defend Customer against any claim, demand or proceeding made or brought by a third party (“Third-Party Claim”) against Customer alleging that the Service, when used as authorized under this TOS, infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, or Trademark, and will indemnify Customer against any liability, direct damages, cost, loss or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by or awarded against Customer as a result of, or for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement approved by Copper in writing of, any such Third-Party Claim against Customer. If Customer’s use of the Service is (or in Copper’s opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Copper determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Copper may, in its sole discretion: (i) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services; (ii) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Service; or if (i) and (ii) are not commercially reasonable, (iii) terminate this TOS and Customer’s subscription to the Service. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Copper will not apply to the extent the applicable claim is attributable to: (A) the modification of the Service by any party other than Copper; (B) the combination of the Service with products or processes not provided by Copper; (C) any unauthorized use of the Service; (D) any breach of the Agreement by Customer or its Authorized Users; (E) any subscription to or use of the Service for which no Fees are paid to Copper; or (F) any action arising as a result of Customer Content or any third-party services, deliverables, integrations, open source software, or components contained within the Service. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH COPPER’S SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIM DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.Indemnification by Customer. Customer will defend Copper against any Third-Party Claim against Copper (i) alleging that any Customer Content, any use by Customer of the Service or any Third-Party Service, or any product or service offered by Customer in connection with or through its use of the Service, infringes any U.S. patent, copyright or Trademark or (ii) arising from Customer’s use of the Services or Customer Content in an unlawful manner or in violation of this TOS, the Documentation or any Order Form, and will indemnify Copper against any liability, direct damages, cost, loss or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees awarded against Copper as a result of, or for amounts paid by Copper under a settlement approved by Customer in writing of, any such Third-Party Claim against Copper. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH customer’s SOLE LIABILITY AND COPPER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIM DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.Indemnification Procedures. In the event of any potential indemnity obligation under this Section 10, the indemnified party will (i) promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, (ii) allow the indemnifying party the right to control the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim at the indemnifying party’s sole cost and expense and (iii) upon request of the indemnifying party, provide all necessary cooperation at the indemnifying party’s expense. Failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of a claim under this Section 10 will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section 10; however, the indemnifying party will not liable for any litigation expenses that the indemnified party incurred prior to the time when notice is given or for any damages or costs resulting from any material prejudice caused by such delay or failure to provide notice to the indemnifying party in accordance with this Section 10. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim in any matter that would require obligation on the part of the indemnified party (other than payment or ceasing to use infringing materials), or any admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the indemnified party’s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Further, any indemnification obligation under this Section 10 will not apply if the indemnified party settles or makes any admission with respect to a claim without the indemnifying party’s prior written consent.Additional Limitations and RequirementsThird-Party Services. The Service enables linking between various online third-party services such as third-party email, cloud storage, social and similar services (“Third-Party Services”). To take advantage of these feature and capabilities, Customer may be required to authenticate, register for, or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers. By linking Customer’s account on the Service to Customer’s account on a Third-Party Service, Customer is authorizing Copper to access Customer’s Third-Party Service account (and any information, content, materials and features included therein) and use such Third-Party Service (with read and write privileges) on Customer’s behalf for the purpose of integrating the Service with such Third-Party Service. Customer’s use of the Third-Party Services is governed solely by the agreement between Customer and the provider of such Third-Party Service, and the Third-Party Services provider, and not Copper, is solely responsible for such Third-Party Service. As between Customer and Copper, Customer is solely responsible for securing and backing up data stored on Third-Party Services, including any data that is used to create or that is the basis of any Customer Content. The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links or other access to third-party sites and resources on the internet (including without limitation Third-Party Services). Customer acknowledges and agrees that Copper does not endorse such sites or resources and that Copper will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused by Customer’s use of or reliance on any content, events, goods or services made available through any such Third-Party Service.Mobile Devices.

To the extent Customer accesses the Service through a mobile device, Customer’s wireless service carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing and using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by Customer’s carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.Apple-Enabled Software Applications. Copper may offer Apple-Enabled Software for use in connection with an Apple-branded product. In addition to the other terms and conditions set forth in this TOS, the following terms and conditions apply with respect to such Apple-Enabled Software.Copper and Customer acknowledge that this TOS is concluded between Copper and Customer only, and not with Apple and that as between Copper and Apple, Copper, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Apple-Enabled Software and the content thereof. Customer may not use the Apple-Enabled Software in any manner that is in violation of or inconsistent with the Usage Rules set forth for Apple-Enabled Software in the App Store Agreement.Customer’s license to use the Apple-Enabled Software is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Apple-Enabled Software on an iOS Product that Customer owns or controls as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Agreement, except that the Apple-Enabled Software may be accessed, acquired and used by other accounts associated with Customer via Family Sharing or volume purchasing.Apple has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software.Apple is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law. In the event of any failure of the Apple-Enabled Software to conform to any applicable warranty, Customer may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Apple-Enabled Software to Customer, if any; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, which will be Copper’s sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable law.Copper and Customer acknowledge that Copper, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims of Customer or any third party relating to the Apple-Enabled Software or Customer’s possession and/or use of that Apple-Enabled Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Apple-Enabled Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.In the event of any third-party claim that the Apple-Enabled Software or Customer’s possession and use of that Apple-Enabled Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Copper and Apple, Copper, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.Federal Government Provisions. Copper provides the Service, including related software and technology, for federal government end use solely in accordance with this Section 11.4. The Service includes “commercial items,” as defined at FAR 2.101. Use of the Service by the U.S. government is limited to the license rights expressly set forth in this TOS in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and FAR 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense transactions, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data - Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Commercial Computer Software Documentation). If a government agency needs additional rights not conveyed under this TOS, it must negotiate a mutually acceptable written addendum to this TOS specifically conveying such rights.Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration (PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS CUSTOMER’S RIGHTS.)Most Customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the Customer’s satisfaction by emailing user support at support@copper.com. In the unlikely event that the Copper’ support team is unable to resolve a complaint Customer may have (or if Copper has not been able to resolve a dispute) such disputes shall be addressed through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.Copper and Customer agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which Customer is not a member of a certified class; andclaims that may arise after the termination of this TOSReferences to “Copper” and “Customer” include their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between Copper and Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude Customer from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Copper on Customer’s behalf. Customer agrees that, by entering into this TOS, Customer and Copper are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This TOS evidence a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this TOS.A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Copper should be addressed to Copper CRM, Inc., Attention: Legal Department, 301 Howard St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94105 (“Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Copper and Customer do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, Customer or Copper may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Copper or Customer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which Customer or Copper is entitled.The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this TOS, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this TOS. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. Unless Copper and Customer agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If Customer’s claim is for $10,000 or less, Copper agrees that Customer may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Customer’s claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Copper will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Rules. However, if Customer initiates an arbitration in which Customer seeks more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. CUSTOMER AND COPPER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN CUSTOMER’S OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both Customer and Copper agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.Notwithstanding any provision in this TOS to the contrary, Copper agrees that if Copper makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Arbitration Notice address) while Customer is a user of the Service, Customer may reject any such change by sending Copper written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, Customer is agreeing that Customer will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provisionMiscellaneousAssignment. Customer will not assign or transfer this TOS, including any assignment or transfer by reason of merger, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of Customer’s assets, change of control or operation of law, without Copper’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Copper may assign this TOS to any affiliate or in the event of merger, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of Copper’s assets, change of control or operation of law.Governing Law; Venue; Survival of Claims.
