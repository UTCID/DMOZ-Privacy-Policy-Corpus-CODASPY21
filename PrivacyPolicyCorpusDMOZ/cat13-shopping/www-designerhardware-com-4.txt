PRIVACY STATEMENT [last updated 2/26/2019].----
SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?
When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us—such as your name, company name, mailing address, phone number and email address. We only use your name and address info in order to successfully deliver your purchase to the intended destination. Your phone number is only used in the event we need to get in touch with you due to a problem with your order or delivery of your order, or if you choose to receive SMS receipts and/or order notifications.
When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information about your location, operating system and internet browser, and to aid us in identifying potentially fraudulent transactions.If you've given us permission to email you (i.e. signed up for our mailing list via a form on our website, agreed to receive marketing emails at the time of placing an order on our website, signed up for a giveaway or promotion we were affiliated with on a third party website, or provided us with your email address in our store), we may send you emails about new products, promotions, and/or events. You can unsubscribe at any time using the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of these emails.
SECTION 2 - CONSENT
How we obtain your consent:
When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
How to withdraw your consent:
You may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at support@designerhardware.com.
SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE
We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service. This is the only scenario where your personal information will be disclosed. We will never sell your information to third parties for marketing purposes.
SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY
Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
Payment:
If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase (i.e. entering your credit card number in the checkout form as opposed to using a gift card, PayPal or Amazon Pay), then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored by Shopify only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. LEIF never sees your full credit card number (only the last 4 digits) and does not store your payment information.
All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers. For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.
SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors (i.e. PayPal, Amazon Pay), have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

SECTION 6 - SECURITY
To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption.  Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.
