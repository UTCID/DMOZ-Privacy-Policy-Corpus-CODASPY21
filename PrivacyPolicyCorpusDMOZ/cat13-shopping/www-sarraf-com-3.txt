Shipping Information (yes, we do), Method & Limits
Sarraf.com will ship any order under $25,000 to an APO, FPO, or DPO address. We ship all APO/FPO orders via USPS Priority Mail to the appropriate APO/FPO processing center then via the military postal service and shipment tracking is not available for APO/FPO addresses. For security purposes, USPS will not show a delivery scan or in transit scans for packages sent to these addresses
Estimated Shipping Times
Sarraf.com guarantees your package will arrive at the appropriate APO/FPO processing center within 2-4 business days. Most shipments usually arrive to you within a total of 5-10 business days. However, some orders may take up to 20 business days to arrive. If you are already familiar with sending packages to APO & FPO addresses, your Sarraf.com order is likely to arrive in about the same amount of time.
Insurance
As with all Sarraf.com orders, your shipment is insured from the moment it leaves our door until it arrives at yours.
Sales Tax Information
Because APO/FPO addresses are considered domestic, no taxes or duties are due on orders shipped to them. If an order is shipped directly to a base, rather than through the APO/FPO system, however, taxes and duties would be applicable. Sarraf.com will include all required tax documentation with your order.
How to Format Addresses
Improperly formatting your address may result in delivery delays. Please enter your ship to information in the following format for APO/FPO/DPO shipments:
RANK Full Name PSC/UNIT/CMR, Box #(if applicable) CITY (APO, FPO, or DPO), STATE (AA, AP, or AE), ZIP (5-digit or ZIP+4) Use AE for Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Canada, AP for Pacific, AA for Central & South America
Example: PFC Jack Lyon Unit 1234, Box 56789 United States APO, AP 96522-1215
Returns
Sarraf.com's regular return policy applies to orders shipped to APO/FPO addresses. Although Sarraf.com's standard return period is 30 days after shipping, we understand that packages shipped to APO/FPO addresses may take longer than this to arrive. If your order does not arrive within 30 days, you may still return your order.
Product Restrictions
Shipments are subject to the import restrictions of the country in which your base is located. See https://www.usps.com/ship/apo.htm for details.
Other FAQs
My billing address is an APO/FPO, but I want to send an order to an address state side; can I do this? Yes, we can deliver to US addresses if your billing address is an APO/FPO
Will a signature be required for delivery? Signature requirements will be determined by the military postal service.
I am posted overseas, can my shipment from Sarraf.com be sent via APO/FPO/DPO to my location? Yes, we ship orders going to APO address with all documentation needed for Customs clearance via APO mail system. Orders shipped overseas via a APO/FPO/DPO are subject to the destination country's restrictions on prohibited items but are not subject to local duty or sales tax.
If I'm in a hurry to get my shipment, can I send it to my local address instead of using the APO address? You may ship orders directly to your local U.S. base address, subject to military restrictions, for faster delivery times. Any international shipments sent to a non-APO/FPO/DPO address are subject to the local country's duties and taxes.

What is a Gold?
Gold is durable, sturdy, dependable, and makes an ideal setting for your precious diamond jewelry. Gold also comes in a variety of colors -- yellow, white, and rose (or pink).
The karatage of the jewelry will tell you what percentage of gold it contains: 24 karat is 100 percent, 18 karat is 75 percent, and 14 karat is 58.5 percent gold. When comparing gold jewelry, the higher the number of karats, the greater the value.
When buying gold jewelry, always look for the karat mark. All other things being equal, the higher the karat, the more expensive the piece. In the United States, 14-karat gold, or 585 parts pure gold, is the most common degree of fineness. Nothing less than 10 karats can legally be marked or sold as gold jewelry in the U.S. However, lower karatages, such as 8-karat gold and 9-karat gold, are popular in other countries
Approximate Metal Weight is intended use is for you to have an indication of Approximate weight of the metal. While being accurate is very important to us at Sarraf.com, due to factors beyond our control it is impossible to be exact each and every time, therefore we strive to maintain an accuracy of ± 5%.
What is a 925 Sterling silver?
In its pure form silver is almost as soft as gold, and therefore is usually alloyed with copper for strength. Karatage is not marked because, legally, anything called "silver" or "sterling silver" is 92.5% pure.
Fine Silver in its natural state, 999/1000 pure, is too soft an element for practical jewelry. To make it workable, an alloy such as copper is added. Here are the main silver alloys. Sterling Silver is a mixture of 92.5 % pure silver (925 parts) and 7.5 % metal alloy.
What is a carat?
"Carat Weight" is simply the weight of the diamond.
By definition, 1 carat is exactly 200 milligrams.
Since most diamonds sold in the jewelry industry weigh less than 1 carat, the carat is usually subdivided into "points."
There are 100 points in 1 carat, so that a diamond weighing 3/4 carat would be a "75 point diamond."
In summary:
1 carat = 200 milligrams = 100 points
Why is carat weight important and how it effects the price?
Carat is the simplest and most objective of the four C's. A 1.00 Carat diamond weighs 0.2 gm on scales weighs. In the trade we call 1/2ct - 50 points.
Naturally more Carat weight means more cost because BIG diamonds are very rare. A diamond of double the weight costs around 4 times more. Add the magic weight idea to rarity: a 1.00ct D color Flawless costs 1.7 times more than a 99 point D Flawless.
Diamonds are graded on a letter scale from D to Z: D, E, or F diamonds have no color detectable to the unaided eye;
grad G, H, I, or J are nearly colorless, but a trained gemologist can detect a slight yellow cast. J through Z colored diamonds have yellow or gray color visible to the unaided eye. Diamonds rated lower than I have color that is detectable even to the untrained eye. Those rated J to M have a trace of color, while any diamond with an N or higher carries a noticeable yellow tint
The charts above are clarity plots, which is a representation of the number and size of inclusions typically present in diamonds of a particular clarity grade. Look for a clarity plot on a diamond certificate, or grading report, to get a clear idea of the number and size of inclusions in a particular diamond. From this map, you can perfectly determine a diamond's clarity without even
Clarity determination factors
Gemologists use grades of clarity to describe how many inclusions a diamond has. These grades range from flawless (FL) or internally flawless (IF) to included (I3), with the numbers indicating varying degrees of quality within a grade (1 being the best).
Most commonly diamond sold are diamond that has no inclusions visible to the unaided eye, like VS1 and SI1-2. Diamonds of this clarity are much less expensive than flawless diamonds, and will not contain inclusions that would reduce from the splendor of the diamond
