Privacy Policy:

operates hombresfoods.com and may operate other websites. It
is hombresfoods's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, hombresfoods collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. hombresfoods's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how hombresfoods's visitors use its website. From time to
time, hombresfoods may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
hombresfoods also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on hombresfoods.com
blogs/sites. hombresfoods only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to hombresfoods's websites choose to interact
with hombresfoods in ways that require hombresfoods to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that hombresfoods gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at hombresfoods.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with hombresfoods are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, hombresfoods collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
hombresfoods. hombresfoods does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, hombresfoods discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when hombresfoods believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the

may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
