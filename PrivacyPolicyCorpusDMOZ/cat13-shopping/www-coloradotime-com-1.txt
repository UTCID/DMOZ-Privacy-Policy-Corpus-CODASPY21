I wanted to let you know that it has been a wonderful experience working with the new version of the System 6 Timing Console.  After receiving the updated system and using it at a meet, I was extremely impressed with the current version.  It truly has taken timing technology to a new level.
United States Army
My hat is off to you and your company - not one company that we have dealt with in the States has been as organized, clear in the descriptions and fees involved, nor as fast...the shipment arrived this morning!!  Great work guys, you should have customers standing at your doors.
Mira Costa High School
We're the envy of all Southern California.  It was great to work with Colorado Time Systems.  The install was timely, and they trained us on the software, and everything went smoothly.  They did a lot of good things for us!
Tunica County
Since its opening, we have hosted the Rhodes College Invitational Swim Meet, as well as several local meets.  We were chosen to host these events because the Colorado Time Systems equipment we have in place is the same as most NCAA Championship meets.
University of Missouri – Columbia
We wanted state-of-the-art quality entertainment, not as an afterthought.  The students were exact about their demands, and CTS came through with not just state-of-the-art product, but even prototypical product.
Campbell County School District
The board is the next step in enhancing the experience for the athletes, parents, and students.  It brings us to the next level of competition.
Pat Kirk
Aquatics Director
University of Georgia
It came down to wanting to deal with just one company.  I've been pleased with Colorado Time Systems for years.  They've always gone out of their way to be accommodating.  They're great.
Clovis Unified School District
This scoreboard is a nice thing for us!  We have never had the capacity before - now we will be able to do chase starts, run both ends of the pool; and have (2) 8-lane courses on the board at the same time.  We'll be able to display heat, lane, time, and place, then come back and import for finals, and put names on the board.
South Lyon East High School
We liked the flexibility of the scoreboard, with its ability to display multiple sports.  It  complements the facility -- the new scoreboard provides recognition for the swimmers by displaying their entire names.  The board has all of the features imaginable.  CTS stands by their products and they stand by their customer.
Gold Crown Field House
I can't thank you enough for allowing us to use the shot clocks.  The tournament was a huge success - lots of happy kids.  We really appreciate the generosity and support of wheelchair basketball in Colorado.
Mentor Marlins Swim Team
I wanted to extend my appreciation to CTS.  CTS staff has been very courteous and efficient.  Please pass this big THANK YOU to all at CTS.
Jim Decker
Zeeland Aquatic Center
The Zeeland Public Schools have used CTS products for the past 27 years; and I, as the coach, have supported their use for my 34 years of coaching.  One of the biggest factors in choosing CTS products is that they are used by a majority of teams in our area with good results.
University of North Carolina
The Colorado Time Systems scoreboard is an invaluable part of our college dual meets and club meets for both swimming and diving.  We also use the scoreboard during practice and water polo tournaments.  We have connected it to a satellite dish to use it as a big television for our college basketball games as students wait to get tickets.
Grosse Pointe South High School
The Colorado timing and display system has tremendously helped our school to offer the most state-of-the-art pool facility.  CTS has been more than accommodating with all of our requests and it is evident that they strive for excellence with all of their products.  I would highly recommend CTS to any other Athletic Director across the country without hesitation.
Eric Gunderson - Boys Swim Coach
Colorado Time Systems is always trying to create a better experience for the coaches, swimmers, and fans.  The big difference between CTS and other manufacturers is that CTS is a swimming company that makes scoreboards too, versus a scoreboard company that happens to make timing equipment.  CTS is focused on the coaches, the swimmers, and improving both the meets and the training.  All around, they are out to improve the sport of swimming.
USA Water Polo
What sets Colorado Time Systems equipment apart for us is the value proposition.  They make great, reliable scoreboards, 30-second clocks and other water polo electronics, and they provide premium equipment at outstanding prices.  They are also innovators, offering new solutions in score keeping as well as training tools.  Our partnership with Colorado Time Systems was a key ingredient to our silver medal performances at the Beijing Olympic Games, and will help us as we prepare for the Games in London.
Park City Swimming
I just wanted to send a quick thank you note for your help with our new scoreboard.
We are very excited to be running Colorado Timing Equipment and using the best products on the market.
Also, more importantly, our experience, from start to finish has been amazing and professional.
Everyone has been extremely helpful and made sure that the whole process goes the best possible direction.
It is refreshing to work with professionals that not only care about their product, but also take care of the customers and keep the experience positive.
You have taken care of extremely well and we appreciate all of your time and efforts!
United States Synchronized Swimming
I am the National Scoring Chair for US Synchronized Swimming and was also the Chief Recorder for the World Trophy meet in Mexico City.
I can't thank you enough for the support that Colorado Time Systems gave to that competition.
I never could have gotten through this competition without the support of CTS.
University of Minnesota
As one of the early adopters, the University Aquatic Center has been using the Dolphin System during major events and championships since 2008.
The Dolphin System saves time for the meet manager as well as the administrative official, whom no longer needs to collect watch times out on the pool deck.
The backup times are right there on your screen.
The Dolphin System provides a much quicker and more efficient way to run your swim meet.
Luke Day
Aquatic Program Coordinator
Tsunami U.S. Masters Swim Club
Our team recently successfully competed at the US Masters Summer National Championship at the University of Maryland.
USMS offered us one of your pace clocks, and we were happy to accept!
We really appreciate the pace clock that Colorado Time Systems has provided us.
Our team has been utilizing it in practices and it also serves as a great marketing tool to recruit new swimmers (the display is awesome and can be seen from afar!).
Art Vera
Head Coach
Mountain West Conference
On behalf of the Mountain West Conference Office and the ten universities that competed in the 2015 Mountain West Swimming and Diving Championships, we want to thank you and your staff for helping make the Championship so great.
The effort by Colorado Time Systems to get the fins fitted to the blocks in such a small window of time was truly amazing.
We all are so grateful that you took on the challenge and exceeded expectations.
Carrie Coll
Associate Commissioner, Championships

I just wanted to express my thanks for the great work that you guys have put into helping us with the Stark Bulkhead Adaptors.
When they are properly installed and tightened, they work very well.

Thank you for all of Colorado teams' support during the installation process.
They were extremely helpful, this was a long awaited project that has finally been completed.

We are hosting the Mississippi Long Course Swimming Championships in July and the Mississippi High School Championships in the fall [2015].
The new video board your company installed last year has been a big asset to our swim meet experience.
Ronnie Mayers
Director of Intercollegiate Athletics / Director of Aquatics
Ohio Masters Swim Club
We use the pace clock daily.
Because it operates on batteries, we have a great deal of flexibility in how we use it at the pool.
As Masters swimmers, we appreciate the large illuminated digits, which are easily visible to our old eyes, even 50m away!
Judi Norton
Head Coach
Bulgarian Swimming Federation
We have had one of your systems for over 12 years now and it is still doing a really good job.
Thank you for your excellent products.
Cerritos College
After hosting our first home game with our new game (water polo) equipment, I must say that we are happy that we purchased the multisport wireless console.
Everything worked great and we can't wait to host 2 big tournaments this fall.

Myrtha Pools [Invictus Games]
Myrtha Pools is thrilled to be partnered with Colorado Timing Systems (CTS) on the Invictus Games build and meet operation.  Our longstanding relationship with CTS has always lead to spectacular finished products and events.  CTS’s willingness to support such an outstanding organization is appreciated by all involved.  Thanks again to the CTS Team and we look forward to an amazing Games!

Gen7 Diving Equipment
The Gen7 judging terminals offer excellent features that will continue to help USA Diving events advance to the next level.
The judges love having the ability to see all of the dive information and scores without looking at the leaderboard, resulting in a more seamless event.
The new technology ultimately benefits our fans, officials, athletes, and coaches.
USA Diving
Greenville Splash Masters
Thank you so much for awarding the Colorado Time Systems' pace clock to Greenville Splash Masters.  We were thrilled beyond belief to receive it!  We are building a new Masters program at the Salvation Army Kroc Center in Greenville, SC.  This facility did not have an electronic clock and the small pace clock was really difficult to see (especially for the older swimmers).  We are really enjoying the benefits of having a large digital display as we work out and do sets together as a team.  All of our members are very appreciative of this gift along with the facility.  We are happy to be adding new members each week, and I am sure that the pace clock helps to make our program more professional.
Leslie Scott
Director / Head Coach
Miami University
We installed our old Colorado Time Systems’ video display back in 2002.  Although the display still ran, it was time for us to upgrade to newer technology.  We have worked with CTS for years and their staff has always been extremely responsive and helped us through any issues that we have had.  It was the obvious choice to stay with them to complete this upgrade.  The new video board is  big, bright, it pops, and there are so many incredible things that we can do now.  As an example, we now have the ability to display complete information for two pool racing, as well as diving and swimming simultaneously.
John Mihevic
Aquatic Director
Rowan University
We chose the Colorado Time Systems video system because of the additional features it has to offer.  The fans and spectators are going to enjoy its capabilities.  I'm most excited about the display's latest technology and functions for our sport [swimming].  It will provide a better atmosphere for the meets.  We will be able to show videos prior and the times are easier to read.
Brad Bowser
Head Swimming and Diving Coach
Seton Hall University
We are excited to once again partner with Colorado Time Systems on the installation of a video display in our swimming & diving facility.  The display will nicely complement our existing Colorado Time Systems components.

I'm delighted to announce to the NSU community that installation of the new scoreboard at the Competition Pool is complete.  All systems are working very well, even with some enhanced features.

I cannot tell you all enough at CTS about how appreciative I am that you have been so good to me over the years.  Thank you all from us here.  This once again proves that the CTS system and the company behind it is better than any other on the market.
Mike Duswalt

First off, I want to thank your entire company.  The level of customer service, support, and quality of products has been amazing.  It is very comforting knowing that I can always call on your team.  Huge shout out to everyone in the company.

I wanted to let you guys know that our diving scoreboard worked flawlessly at the zones diving championship.  Also, your Field Technician was awesome in both the work and the results.  We literally couldn't have asked for anything else.
