The personal information you furnish is very important to us. Information provided to Cocopah and the Bead of the Month Club will be kept confidential.

There are two other services we use, so we want to provide links to their policies.
We send you a monthly email of the Sneak Preview of our Bead and Kit of the Month using MailChimp because it’s trustworthy and efficient. MailChimp's privacy policy is here. Neither we nor MailChimp will ever spam you.
Our online store uses e-commerce software by Volusion. We encourage you to review Volusion's updated privacy policy as well.
