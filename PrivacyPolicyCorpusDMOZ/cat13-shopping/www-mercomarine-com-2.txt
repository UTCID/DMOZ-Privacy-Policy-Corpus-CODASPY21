Specific information we look for in the statistics log includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/ exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.

This information is used for billing purposes and to complete customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information provided will be used to contact a user.

This web site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that we, Merco Marine, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

3.D Security
Merco Marine takes every precaution to protect our user’s information (such as credit card number, etc.) When users submit sensitive information via our web site, their information is protected both online and offline.
When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. Before entering a secure page, such as our order form where personal information is being requested, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. You will most likely see some type of “locked” symbol somewhere on your browser to let you know that you are viewing a secured portion of our web site.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our user information, not just sensitive information, is restricted to our office. We maintain a physical paper copy of all information from online orders in a secure location in our office.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.
4. Lost or Damaged Goods
YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY INSPECT YOUR SHIPMENT AT THE TIME IT IS RECEIVED!
The material was carefully counted, packaged and properly loaded for shipment when accepted by the carrier.
In the event of any loss or damage, the delivery receipt MUST BE SIGNED AND NOTED AS SUCH. You must also notify us within 5 business days so that we may go over what is missing or damaged on your order and we can then follow up with the carrier and put in a claim for the merchandise. If preceding conditions are not met, the transportation company will not entertain any claim for loss or damage. Your acceptance of a shipment that is short or in damaged condition without proper notation is done at your own risk.
After an inspection report and claim have been submitted to the carrier, you MUST RETAIN the material for possible carrier pickup, prior to the payment of the claim.
Once we have received a copy of the delivery receipt with your signature we then will ship out replacement material if the situation permits.
Note: Claims for loss or damage must not be deducted from our invoice, nor payment be withheld.
If users have any questions, problems, or changes about information provided on our web site they can email merco@mercomarine.com.
