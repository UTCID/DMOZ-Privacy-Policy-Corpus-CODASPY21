Policies – Return & Privacy
RETURN POLICY
Our first priority is always your satisfaction. The sale is not complete until you receive what you order and you like it. We accept all returns for any reason – no questions asked (although we always prefer to know if you have any problems with anything you receive) – within a month of the date of shipment. We will either credit your account or refund the price you paid for the item. We do not refund shipping charges in either direction – to you or back to us – unless your dissatisfaction is clearly a result of our error.
