At the Customer's request, Makoti Down Products will ship goods to the customer using insured post or courier. The Customer agrees that any and all Makoti Down Products liability for delivery of goods shipped using any courier or postal service ends when the goods leave the Makoti Down Products warehouse. Makoti Down Products will insure all shipments for maximum value and will ship goods using a tracking number if and when available. In the case of lost or missing shipments, the Customer agrees that his/her sole remedy is to provide notice of such lost or missing shipment to Makoti Down Products, after which Makoti Down Products will file a claim for the missing package, and upon payment of such claim by the courier or postal service to Makoti Down Products, Makoti Down Products will immediately refund the customer. Note that the claim process for lost or missing shipments may take 3 months or longer.Our Postage normally takes 3-5 working days to get to the next post office depending on the area. Courier takes about 2-3 days. Please ensure the correct shipping address is provided from the outset as title and risk will pass to you once the order has left our premises.International Orders:
International orders are shipped only from our South African offices and are automatically insured for the full value of the shipment. The Customer is responsible for all customs, duties and taxes payable at the country's customs offices when these goods are imported into his/her country. Rates for duty and taxes vary from country to country. As Makoti Down Products does not know the duty rates for individual countries, you are advised to check locally with your government customs agents to see what rate you would pay for these 'electronic navigation' goods. In the event any customs, duties, taxes, or additional handling fees for your order are billed back to us, you agree that Makoti Down Products can automatically bill you for an amount equal to the sum of the additional fees PLUS an R150.00 (ZAR) handling fee. You can avoid these charges by ensuring that all fees have been paid when you pick up your package.Depending on the value of your order and/or your country of destination, we may require additional identification and/or pre-payment by wire transfer prior to your order being processed and shipped. If we deem this necessary, you will be advised by return email and your order will be held 'pending' until resolved.In the event that an order fails to arrive at your international destination, Makoti Down Products will track the shipment and reroute it if necessary. If the shipment is lost, Makoti Down Products will submit an insurance claim for the order and will provide a refund to you immediately upon receipt of the insurance claim refund. This can take upwards of 30 days in some instances.Once your order has been processed and has left our facilities, the shipment cannot be stopped. In the event that you refuse to accept delivery of the shipment in your country, Makoti Down Products will act to have the goods immediately returned, and upon receipt, you agree that Makoti Down Products will refund you the full amount of your order, less all shipping, handling, and insurance fees to ship the goods to you. Returns for goods shipped internationally are permitted if the item is defective within 30 days from the date of shipment. Defective items can be returned for repair or replacement, at our discretion. You are responsible for returning the goods to us at your expense, and once repaired, we will pay shipping costs to have the goods shipped back to youUndeliverable packages
Occasionally packages are returned to us undeliverable. Should this event take place every attempt will be made to contact you to make arrangements for re-shipment. In the event of a parcel(s) being returned due to failure on your part to collect or due to incorrect shipping details supplied, any additional charges incurred by us in such instances will be for your account.Order processingOrder processing will not begin until we receive a confirmed order and full payment.Refunds/returns PolicyWe are so sure of our quality, that each of our products is backed by a warranty against faulty workmanship. In the unlikely event that you are not completely satisfied with your Makoti Down Product purchase, please return it to us undamaged and unused within 30 days for a full refund.
International returns:  please ensure that your courier offers shipment tracking and ensure that the package is insured for safe return and declare the full value of the shipment failing which loss or damage will be for your account.Payment Options and PricingAll transactions will be processed in South African Rands (ZAR). Makoti Down Products endeavours to offer you competitive prices on current products; your total order price will include the price of the purchase plus any applicable VAT and shipping charges (on the day of shipping). Makoti Down Products reserves the right to change pricing at any time without prior notice.Credit Card
