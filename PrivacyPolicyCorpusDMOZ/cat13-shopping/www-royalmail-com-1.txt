These guidelines show the best way to address your mail for fast delivery in the UK and abroad.
Write the address clearly on the front following our clear addressing guide lines and always include a postcode when you can. You can search for up to 50 postcodes or addresses, free of charge, with our Postcode Finder.
Before sending your item, please check our  Prohibited and restricted items - advice for personal customers and Country guides to make sure your item can be sent in the mail.
Addressing your item
The name and address go on the bottom left corner of the front of the envelope or parcel.
Use a clear and easy to read hand writing (or font if you are printing the address).
Use a pen or ink that is clear against the colour of the envelope or parcel.
Left align the text (no centred or 'stepped' lines).
No commas or full stops.
Leave a generous margin around the address.
Place the correct postage on the top right.
To protect you and the recipent's privacy please don't include telephone numbers or email addresses on the outside of your item.
Remember to include a return address  so if for any reason your item can't be delivered, we can send it back to you.
Write the words 'return address' on the back of the envelope and underneath that, the actual return address.
Best way to write a UK address
British Forces Post Office (BFPO) addresses
The address layout is:
Service Number, Rank and Name
Unit/Regiment
Operation or Location Name (if applicable)
BPFO Number
Please note:  the town and country mustn't be included
Please go to our HM Forces Mail page for full details, and any restrictions.
A full list of BFPO addresses is available at Gov.uk.
Typical way to write an address to an international destination
Using coloured envelopes (Tip - stick on a white label with black ink.)
It's important that the address shows up against the colour of your envelope.
Address format in detail
Top lines
Write or print the name of the person (or people) you are sending to on the first line, above the address. It's best to include their surname as well as their first name.
You can add a line for an organisation name.
Middle lines
Use a line for the property number and street name.
If the property has a full name, this can take up one line and drop the street name onto the next line.
Next line can be used to name the local area or village name.
Next line should be for the town. Write the name of the town in capital (upper case) letters.
There is no need to include a county name, your letters and parcels will reach your intended recipient without one. If, however, you'd prefer to include a county name, you' are welcome to do so.
Bottom line
UK destination: The final line should be the UK postcode, again in capital letters.
International destination: After the area code, add the country name to the final line, again in capital letters.
Address formats for specific countries:
Australia
The State abbreviation should be inserted on the same line as, and between, the town and the postcode.

Germany
Germany has strict rules about receiving mail, which, if ignored, may result in your mail being returned to you with no attempt at delivery. When addressing mail to Germany, always:
Use the new five-digit postcode (using an old four-digit postcode will cause delay)
Put the postcode before the town name
Put the house number after the street name

Ireland
In 2015 a seven digit postcode system was developed for Ireland and should be used in all addresses, other than those for PO Boxes.
All mail for Ireland should now be addressed as illustrated below:
Eason
80 Abbey Street Middle
DUBLIN 1
DO1 P8N3
IRELAND
The introduction of the new codes will not in any way affect the existing address structure. The postcode will occupy a new line at the bottom of addresses for domestic mail and the penultimate line for international mail.
