We are the controller of the personal data that you submit to us and take responsibility for your personal data under applicable data protection laws.
Way Funky Company Pty Ltd is based in Australia, it is an "organisation" and "APP (Australian Privacy Principles) Entity" for the purposes of the Privacy Act 1988 ("Act"), and is subject to the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Act. In case you are an individual and reside in the European Union or the European Economic Area, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, OJ L 119 of 4 May 2016, p. 1-88) and domestic data protection law of your Member State can apply.
Other policies may override this Privacy Policy in certain circumstances. For example, when we collect personal information from you, we may advise a specific purpose for collecting that personal information, in which case we will handle your personal information in accordance with that stated purpose.

EXEMPTIONSNo general exemptions under the Act apply to us, or to any of our acts or practices.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION We will collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so, and will limit the personal information we collect to that which is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities.
WHAT WE COLLECTThe personal information about you we may collect and hold includes but is not limited to your name and address, geographical data, gender, date of birth, passport or other ID-information (if required and provided by you), your position inside the business partner company (e.g. retail shop), details related to payment process, contact telephone number(s) and/or email address(es). We do not hold any sensitive information about you unless you provide it to us. We may also hold information about sporting organisations or related organisations that you have notified us you belong to, and any other personal information that you provide to us.
PURPOSE OF DATA COLLECTIONWe collect your personal information so that we may:
provide the service requested, respond to your enquiries, send you information that you request, or otherwise achieve the purpose for which the information was submitted to us;
process your purchase of goods to you or through you;
engage in marketing measures as per sales contract;
implement contractual or other legal obligations
seek feedback from you and perform market research;
transact more efficiently with you on an ongoing basis; and/or
engage in other activities where required or permitted by law.
The provision of certain data is a requirement to enter into a contract with you as well as to fulfil our statutory obligations. When collecting your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to make you aware of the purposes for which we are collecting it, the types of organisations to which we would usually disclose it, whether we are likely to disclose it to overseas recipients (and where practicable the countries in which they are located), whether there are laws or court/tribunal orders which require or authorise us to collect it, and the main consequences for you if you fail to provide it to us. This Privacy Policy provides these details as they typically apply in most cases, however different details may apply depending on our specific interaction with you. If we do not notify you of such other details, the information in this Privacy Policy applies.
You are not obligated to provide your personal information to us however if you fail to provide personal information requested by us, there may be a range of consequences, for example we may be unable to process or respond to your request. There will not usually be Australian laws or court/tribunal orders which require or authorise us to collect your personal information.
We may, in some circumstances, collect personal information about you from third parties, in which case we will take reasonable steps to notify you of that information and the circumstances of its collection.
For the above mentioned purposes we process personal data only in compliance with applicable data protection laws; especially where the processing is:
necessary for the performance of our contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract ;
necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations (e.g. under corporate, tax or employment law)
necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and as far as your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.

The data that we collect from you is stored in Australia. The data may be transferred to and processed in the European Union if necessary. We employ stringent security measures for all personal information collected via this website and undertake regular monitoring and improvement of our practices and systems to ensure the effectiveness our security policies.
We will endeavour to destroy or de-identify your personal information as soon as it is no longer required by us (and this is permitted by law). We may store personal data during the existing relationship with you and, following its termination, as long as there is a corresponding statutory retention obligation (e.g. under corporate, tax or employment law), a party could assert any claims arising from or in connection with the relationship or other legitimate interests in line with this Privacy Notice apply.  Where we no longer need to process your personal data for the purposes set out above, we will delete your personal data from our systems.  Where permissible, we will also delete your personal data on your request.
