4. Prices and Availability
The prices of the items on this website are listed by each item's description. Despite our best efforts, prices may be listed incorrectly due to human or computer error. In the event of a pricing error, we will NOT honor the incorrect "error" price. This policy applies to pricing on our website and our Newsletters. Known pricing errors will be published in the product description tab.
If you have completed a purchase with an incorrect price, and that price is lower than the actual item cost, we will at our discretion contact you for instructions before the shipment of that item, or cancel your order for that item and notify you of such cancellation.
If you have completed a purchase with an incorrect price, and that price is higher than the actual item cost, we will refund you the difference. This does not apply to regular price changes for our weekly sales.
We cannot adjust the prices of items due to listing errors, or guarantee the availability of any item prior to sale.
Product availability is listed by each item's description. We monitor and check product counts frequently; our software reduces available quantities when a product is sold. Though we strive for perfection, sometimes our product counts are incorrect. We do not back-order out of stock items. If an item is not available when we process your order, we will refund you the the amount of the out of stock item.
