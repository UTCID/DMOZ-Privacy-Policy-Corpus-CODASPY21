The WEEE Directive aims to:- " Minimise the disposal of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and achieve a high level of collection of WEEE for treatment, recovery and
environmentally sound disposal.
" Improve the environmental performance of all those involved in the life cycle of electrical and electronic equipment. Some EEE can contain substances which are potentially hazardous to the environment and human health and must be disposed of in an
environmentally acceptable manner. The WEEE directive ensures that the appropriate treatment is available for such EEE.What does WEEE mean for Private Households? Private householders will be able to return their WEEE to collection facilities free of charge and play their part towards the reuse and
recycling of WEEE.How will I know whether the new products I buy can be recycled? All new electrical and electronic products sold now carry the 'crossed-out wheelie-bin' logo to help you identify which products are
recyclable.
For more information, See the WEE Home Page on the Environment Agency's website Producers (manufacturers, sellers, distributors) will be responsible for financing the collection, treatment, recovery and disposal of WEEE from private households deposited at these collection facilities. Clippers
will meet its obligations under the WEEE directive including
collection, at no cost to the purchaser of an equivalent product. Producers who sell through distance selling methods such as internet and telephone are required to join the national distributor take back scheme or provide an alternative method for private householders to return equipment. Clippers
will meet its obligation to the WEEE Directive in the UK through providing private customers with its Consumer Recycling programme for the collection, treatment, recovery and disposal of WEEE.Contact Details Clippers H.G. REPS Morcycles, 4, Ifton Industrial Park,
