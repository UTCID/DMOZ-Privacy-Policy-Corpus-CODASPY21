We use your IP address, the number that identifies your computer when you use the Web, to diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Website. Your IP address is not linked in any way to your personal information. We only use it to track demographic trends and to log data.
Like most online merchants, we use "cookie" technology as a means of identification and to keep track of the items in your cart. Although cookies are temporarily stored on your hard drive, they do not track your personal information nor do they allow us to control your computer or contact you in any way.
Sensitive data, such as your credit card number, is protected by our secure system, hosted by Bigcommerce, which uses 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to prevent interception of your order information. You can tell when a page is secure by the padlock at the bottom of your browser. If you are concerned about data protection, you are welcome to place your order by telephone by calling 800-742-6800.
