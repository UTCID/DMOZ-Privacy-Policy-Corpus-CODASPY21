Warranty Terms:
Cobra warrants your product against all defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one to three (1-3) years (depending on the product) from the date of original purchase. (Please see owner’s manual for actual device warranty term information)
Cobra, at our sole discretion, will repair or replace your product (with the same or comparable product) free of charge.
Cobra will not pay shipping charges that you incur for sending your product to us. Products received COD will be refused.
To make a warranty claim, we will require proof or purchase in the form of an invoice or receipt.  No proof of purchase is required for factory direct purchases.
Warranty Exclusions: Warranty does not apply to your product under any of the following conditions: 1. The serial number has been removed or modified. 2. Your product has been subjected to misuse or damage (including water damage, physical abuse, and/or improper installation). 3. Your product has been modified in any way. 4. Your receipt or proof-of-purchase is from a non-authorized dealer or internet auction site including E-bay, U-bid, or other non-authorized resellers.
LIMITATION OF WARRANTY: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU ARE ACQUIRING THE PRODUCT "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS", WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY. COBRA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE CONCERNING THE MERCHANTABILITY AND SUITABILITY OF THE PRODUCT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. COBRA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE, MISUSE OR MOUNTING OF THE PRODUCT.
The above limitations or exclusions shall be limited to the extent they violate the laws of any particular state. Cobra is not responsible for products lost in shipment between the owner and our service center.
General Warranty InformationEach product we manufacture is covered by our factory warranty. While each product may have unique components and policy, the general guideline below will apply to most Cobra products.
All Cobra products purchased factory-direct or from our Authorized Resellers will come with a full one to three (1-3) year warranty from the date of the original retail purchase (see policy statement above for full warranty details and exclusions).
Standard accessories packaged with each model will have a one-year factory warranty.
Accessory items have a one-year factory warranty.
Shipping to our facility is not covered in our warranty. Return shipping is included within the US.
This warranty is non-transferrable.
For the sake of clarity, ‘repair or replace the Product or its defective part’ does not include removal or installation work, costs or expenses which include but are not limited to labor costs or expenses.
Cobra will not be responsible for lost packages.
