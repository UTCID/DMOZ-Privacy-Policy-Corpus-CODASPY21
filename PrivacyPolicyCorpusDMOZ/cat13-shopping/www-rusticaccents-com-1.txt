Wood & Faux Wood Beams
Barron Designs’ engineered wood beams replicate the look of older, weathered beams with natural grain patterns. Our various styles and textures mimic the character of wood construction that has endured the years and elements. In addition, our beams are resistant to deterioration, and will maintain this eye-catching appearance for years to come.
Creating rustic ceiling ideas or rugged exterior accents is a snap with Barron Designs. The beautifully weathered look of our beams adds three-dimensional, eye-catching detail to your commercial projects.
Our beams are ideal for restaurants, hotels, casinos, retail stores, office environments and much more.
Finding a similarly distressed beam with this level of quality and character, in the size you need, would traditionally be a significant challenge. At Barron, we have custom beams available in thousands of sizes and variations to perfectly suit any project. Our beams are available in a variety of finishes, in both three-sided or four-sided variations, and with or without endcaps.
Our real wood beams are made in the USA, and are constructed from Red Cedar, harvested from the Pacific Northwest. To recreate the beautiful, timeworn surface of century-old wood, we use a proprietary process that is unmatched in its attention to detail and craftsmanship, so that each product has a unique character.
