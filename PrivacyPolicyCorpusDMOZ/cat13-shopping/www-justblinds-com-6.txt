A note from the team at JustBlinds.
We, at justblinds.com, know that times are uneasy, and we sincerely wish everyone well as we find ourselves in uncharted territory with Covid-19.

FAQ's
Can you order samples?
Great news! Our crew at Justblinds is now able to send out samples on a limited selection of our products with plans to expand this to our full array of products soon. You can view availability on each product page. To ensure the safety of our associates, we have reduced the number of people allowed in our warehouse to ensure appropriate social distancing. This may mean that you may experience slower delivery than normal, and we appreciate your patience.
Any changes to ordering or shipping time?
You can order blinds, shades and shutters as you normally would. We are working hard to communicate with all of our vendors and partners to ensure we provide the most recent information for all window treatments on our sites. Want to know how long your choices will take to make? As usual, you can check each item's production time right from that product's page.
What does all this mean for customers?
For the most part, it's business as usual. We are working. We are staying home. We have amazing teams well-equipped to help our customers from just about anywhere — whether it's at our offices or remotely from our homes, we've got your back.
Our commitment to safety and our customers
We truly value you, our staff and all of our communities, so in following our local government's Stay Home — Work Safe order and best practices provided by the CDC, we are working remotely and will continue to go above and beyond to provide the best customer service and deliver quality window treatments to you all.
