13. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER
This section applies to any dispute you have with the Company, unless the dispute involves rights to your, the Company’s, or our licensor’s intellectual property.
Notice of Dispute.  In the event of a dispute, you or the Company must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and a proposed solution.  You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to the Company at Office of General Counsel, Shoe Show, Inc., PO Box 648, Concord, NC, 28026-0648.  The Company will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and the Company will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or the Company may commence arbitration.
Small claims court.  You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court in Cabarrus County, North Carolina or in your own county of residence, if the dispute meets all the requirements to be heard in small claims court.  You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.
Binding Arbitration.  If you and the Company do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.  Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
Class Action Waiver.  Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor the Company will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Arbitration Procedures.  Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.  You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Cabarrus County, North Carolina. The Company agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
Arbitration Fees.  For disputes involving $75,000 or less, the Company will reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.  For disputes involving more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of all filing fees and expenses.
Claims or disputes must be filed within one year.  To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court, or in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute isn't filed within one year, it's permanently barred.
Severability. If any other provision of this section 12 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, with the remainder of section 12 remaining in full force and effect.
14. Termination
The Company may terminate this agreement for any reason at any time.  The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to interrupt, suspend or terminate operation of the Services or to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to and use of the Services, with or without prior notice.  Otherwise applicable sections of the Terms shall survive termination.
15. No Waiver
The failure of the Company to enforce any provisions of the Terms or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect to similar breaches.
16. Miscellaneous
Choice of Law and Forum.  These Terms are governed by, and must be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of North Carolina.  In connection with any dispute not governed by Section 12 of these Terms, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in (or whose jurisdiction comprises) Cabarrus County, North Carolina.
Integration and Severability.  Unless otherwise specified herein, the Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company and govern your use of the Services.  If any portion of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
