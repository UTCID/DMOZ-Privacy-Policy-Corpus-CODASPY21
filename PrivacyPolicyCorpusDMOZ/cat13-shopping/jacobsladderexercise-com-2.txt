We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

For payment, data related to the order such as billing address, email, and order information is sent to PayPal for processing. Information is encrypted both on this website and PayPal. For more information on Privacy and PayPal visit https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full

Users have the option to opt into receiving news, promotions, and other marketing material. If a user opts in, their email and name may be added to an email marketing list to receive future contact.
