Terms/Conditions/Privacy
Policies, Terms and Conditions
Below are the terms and conditions for purchases made from Hansen Wholesale. We believe you will find them to be fair and equitable compared to our competitors and other online retailers. Be sure to read them carefully and let us know if you have any questions or concerns before you make your purchase, because placing an order either by phone or through our shopping cart is an acceptance of these terms. Please note that modifications to these terms and conditions may apply to trade customers who make volume purchases or purchases for resale. Please contact our trade department if you questions regarding the terms for trade accounts.
"No more 30, 60 or 90 day time limits and NO more restocking fees on qualified returns!"
As an Internet seller for over 20 years, we know how important a return policy is to you when shopping online. So here at Hansen Wholesale, we strive to set ourselves aside from our competition by providing customer service above and beyond what you might expect. Our new "Limited Lifetime Return Policy" is a great example of this.
With the introduction of this new policy, as of 11/22/2014, we now have NO time restrictions and NO restocking fees for qualified items that are returned to us in unused resalable condition. Unused resalable condition means the item you wish to return was never used or installed and is being sent back to us in such condition that it can be resold as new. Just to be clear, resalable condition does not mean that you cannot open the box to inspect the item and determine whether or not it is to your liking...we certainly expect you to do just that. It does mean that you must be careful to open the package and inspect your item in a responsible way so that you can repackage it and send it back to us in the same condition we sent it to you. This very liberal policy applies to all retail sales items with the following exceptions: custom made items, closeout specials, items less than $50, discontinued items or items that we no longer carry. Also, purchases made through our trade department may not qualify for this policy because they generally have special conditions and requirements that are negotiated separately.
To help ensure an item will meet the requirements of our "Limited Lifetime Return Policy", please follow these simple common sense guidelines:
Open your package carefully without tearing up the box...so use a knife to cut the tape or pliers to remove large staples.
Keep all of the packaging material in tact and organized and take care to notice how the item was packaged so you can easily repackage it in the event you decide to return it.
Do not tear open hardware packages or other items inside the box that are in sealed plastic and do not cut any wires or make any modifications to the item until you are sure you are going to keep it and are preparing to assemble or install it.
Do not write anything on the box or attach any additional labels unless otherwise instructed to do so by one of our customer service representative.
Use only clear packaging tape to reseal the box once you have repackaged it.
When we receive your returned item, we will inspect it before placing it back on the shelf for resale. If all is good, we will refund for the entire amount you paid for the item less any shipping charges. If for some reason the item is not in resalable condition, many of our manufacturers provide a repackaging service which can drastically minimize your loss. To have an item repackaged, we must ship it back to the manufacturer where they will inspect it, replace missing parts or torn packages and restore it to new resalable condition. If this service is a viable option, we may offer you a refund for the entire amount you paid for the item less any shipping charges and the cost the manufacturer charges for the service.
Processing a Return
All returns require an RMA (Returned Merchandise Authorization) number regardless of whether an item is new or defective. Any returns sent without the proper RMA # will be refused. To request a RMA, simply email customer service at: customerservice@hansenwholesale.com stating you would like to make a return. Please include your original invoice number along with the brand name and model number of the items you wish to return from that invoice as well as a detailed description of why you wish to make the return. Including some pictures with your return request has also proven to be quite beneficial. You will receive further instructions within 2 business days. Return shipping charges must be prepaid by the customer with the exception of defective merchandise or items that we shipped incorrectly. In such cases, we may provide you with a return shipping label or send out call tag at our expense.
Custom Made Items
Custom made items are made specifically to fit your application, so they typically cannot be sold to other customers and are therefore not eligible for a refund once production has begun. If you wish to cancel an order for an item that is to be custom made, please do so right away in order to avoid any charges. There are some cases where we can cancel an order in mid-production with some of our manufacturers, but you will be charged to compensate the manufacturer for cost of labor and materials that have been incurred up to that point. Don't count on this to always be the case, it is the exception to the rule. However, know that we do everything we can to minimize the cost to our customers when circumstances require the cancellation of a custom order.
Discontinued Items & Closeout Specials
Our return policy does not apply to items on our site that have been Discontinued or are indicated as "Closeout Special". Although we will accept the cancellation of a Closeout Special item prior to shipping, once a Discontinued or Closeout Special item has been shipped, the order cannot be canceled, refunded or returned. Often times, Discontinued items and Closeout Specials are being sold at prices near or below dealer cost and we might even be taking a loss just to get them out of our hair, so we hope you understand why we will not take them back.
Defective Merchandise - Standard Delivery
In the unlikely event you receive defective merchandise, contact Hansen Wholesale customer service to receive a return merchandise authorization number (RMA) and return your defective item(s) within 10 days of receipt. We will provide you with instructions for labeling and returning the merchandise. Items returned without a RMA will be refused. Merchandise must be returned and prepaid by the customer. Upon an evaluation by our authorized service technician we will, at our option, replace the product or issue a full refund for the original price of the item plus any shipping charges that were incurred.
Defective Merchandise - Freight Delivery
When you receive an item that is shipped to you from a freight company, whether it is being delivered to your location or to a freight terminal, be sure to open the box or crate and inspect the merchandise before accepting and signing for delivery. We cannot be held responsible for any costs incurred to replace damaged merchandise shipped by a freight carrier that has been accepted and signed for. If you discover upon inspection that the merchandise is damaged, simply refuse to accept the delivery and we will replace that item at no additional cost to you once we receive the returned item from the freight carrier.
Shipments
Non-Freight Deliveries: Delivery by UPS, Federal Express, and United States Post Office: All orders will be shipped to the address provided by you and left at your door by one of these delivery agents. If you prefer your product be signed for, you must call to place your order and request this additional service. There will be an additional fee of $8.00 for Signature Required deliveries. It is understood that if you opt to not have the package/s signed for, any lost or stolen merchandise is your responsibility, provided we do have proof of delivery from the delivering agents that show the products were delivered to your designated delivery address.
Residential Freight Deliveries: In most cases, when a freight company is used to deliver your merchandise to a local terminal, it may not be the same company that offers residential delivery. Therefore, when your merchandise arrives at the freight terminal, it may be transferred to a local delivery service.
In most cases where a residential delivery has been specified for large items we charge a flat $200.00 residential delivery fee which covers getting your merchandise delivered to your address with a lift gate. Residential delivery services are not necessarily responsible for taking items off the lift gate and bringing them into your home or garage. Some local delivery services may offer to do this for you at no charge, others may offer to do this for a fee which you can pay them directly at the time of delivery is you so choose.
Free Shipping: Free Shipping is limited to items shipped within the Contiguous USA as detailed on our Free Shipping Policy Here!. Items indicated as Free Shipping will be delivered using the shipping method of our choice. Items that must be shipped via Common Carrier (trucked items) will be delivered to a freight terminal (see above restrictions for freight deliveries). Free Shipping for trucked items is limited to shipping costs up to $200.00. Because the cost of shipping items via common carrier changes almost daily due to fluctuating fuel surcharges, we reserve the right to not ship any order via common carrier if the cost quoted by the carrier exceeds $200.00. If this is the case, you will be notified and given the opportunity to cancel your order or cover any additional costs over $200.00 and proceed with your order. Free Shipping may not apply to discounted orders placed through a trade account or where we have matched or beat the price of a competitor, in which cases the overall delivered cost of goods has been considered in the reduction of the price.
For further information about what items qualify for Free Shipping, read our complete Free Shipping Policy Here!
Other Policies:
Canceled Orders: If you wish to cancel an order, you must contact customer service via email at: customerservice@hansenwholesale.com as soon as possible in order to avoid any shipping charges. If no portion of your order has shipped you may cancel your order without incurring any charges. If any portion of your order has shipped or has been staged for shipping, the shipping charges that are incurred will be charged to your account and the remaining balance will be credited. In order to have a document trail for both parties, cancellations may only be made via e-mail, no other method will be accepted.
Payment: To provide maximum security for our customers, we do not keep credit card numbers on file or store them in a database where a hacker could access them. Instead, when you place an order by credit card either over the phone or using our secure shopping cart, your credit card is verified through a federally approved secure system and funds for the order are reserved for a short period of time (several days). Your card is not charged by the bank until your order is actually shipped. If there are multiple items on your order that ship on different days or from different locations, you will see separate charges on your statement for the items on each shipment. If a custom order or back ordered items that takes longer to fulfill than the amount of time the funds are reserved, we will call you and take your credit card payment again over the phone when the item is ready to ship.
Lead Time: Lead times vary between manufacturers. The lead times quoted on our site or over the phone are approximate. Although, in most cases, you will receive your merchandise before the end of the lead time, back orders may occur which can delay the shipment of merchandise. When back orders occur, we do our best to notify you so that you have the option of waiting the additional estimated time or cancelling your order with no cancellation fees.
Order Confirmations: If an e-mail address is provided you will receive an e-mail confirmation of your order. Be sure to check your confirmation to ensure all of the information is correct including the shipping address and the individual items on the order. If you find something wrong, please email:
CustomerService@Hansenwholesale.com with the corrections within 48 hours of the e-mailed confirmation. Otherwise, we will assume everything is correct and process your order as it is shown in the confirmation. Placing an order either by phone or through our shopping cart is an agreement to the terms and conditions stated on this page.
Refused Merchandise: Refused merchandise without receiving an RGA# from a Hansen Wholesale Representative, will not be accepted and will be returned to the customer at their expense with the exception of freight merchandise that has been refused due to damage (see Defective Merchandise - Freight Delivery). For further questions regarding these policies, please email us at CustomerService@Hansenwholesale.com
Installation: Installation fees, proper installation and use of any products purchased from Hansen Wholesale is the sole responsibility of the customer. Hansen Wholesale and its subsidiaries are not liable in any case for any costs and or damages associated with the installation or use of products purchased from us. In cases where a product is defective, although we may send a replacement for a defective item as stated in the terms above, we are not liable for any additional costs associated with removing or repairing the defective item and/or installing a replacement.
Trade Accounts: Trade accounts are subject to additional policies and mutual agreements that may or may not differ from the above policies.

We are Celebrating our 22 Year Anniversary Online!
Hansen Wholesale has now been online for over 15 years and we are proud to say that none of our competitors have been doing business online as long as we have. You can buy from us with confidence because we know what it takes to satisfy our online customers.
Overview - About Hansen Wholesale
Who is Hansen Wholesale?
Hansen Wholesale was the very first company to bring ceiling fans and fireplace decor to the Internet. We've been in business since 1976 supplying these products to retail customers and wholesale buyers all over the country. But In late 1994, we turned left onto the information superhighway by creating a website using America Online. Early on, we predicted great potential on the Internet, so in 1995 we branched away from America Online and launched this website, which has have been here ever since. Our years of experience dealing with online customers from all over the world at both the retail and wholesale level gives us a sharp competitive edge and has helped us grow into one of the single largest suppliers of ceiling fans, lighting, and fireplace decor on the Internet.
We Believe in Human to Human interaction!
From the outset, we decided that Human Interaction was going to be the key to our success, so early on, we invested vast resources to develop and maintain a large staff of ceiling fan, lighting and fireplace decor experts to answer questions, quote prices, and process orders over the phone. So if you are looking for the best price possible and prefer to purchase from a well established company who has experts you can talk to, then you will enjoy the benefits of doing business with Hansen Wholesale.
"No more 30, 60 or 90 day time limits and NO more restocking fees on qualified returns!"
As an Internet seller for over 20 years, we know how important a return policy is to you when shopping online. So here at Hansen Wholesale, we strive to set ourselves aside from our competition by providing customer service above and beyond what you might expect. Our new "Limited Lifetime Return Policy" is a great example of this. With the introduction of this new policy, as of 11/22/2014, we now have NO time restrictions and NO restocking fees for qualified items that are returned to us in unused resalable condition.
For more details about this revolutionary new return policy, please read our: Terms and Conditions
LOWEST PRICE GUARANTEE & LIFETIME PRICE PROTECTION PLAN**
Hansen Wholesale guarantees to match or beat any competitor's price at the time of your purchase, so if you find a better price for any exact same item displayed on our site, call us at 1-800-201-1193 or email us at: info@hansenwholesale.com. Be sure to include the details about the item(s) in question as well as links to the competitor's site where you found a better offer. This policy is limited by the Price Guarantee Terms and Conditions stated below*
**Excluded Manufacturers: Some manufactures have UMRP (Unilateral Minimum Resale Price) or other pricing policies that dealers must adhere to in order to maintain their status as a dealer for certain products. As a responsible dealer, we will not violate these policies and therefore will not match prices that are below the price defined by the manufacturer if they have such a policy. Such brands include (but are not limited to): Minka Aire, Minka Lavery, George Kovacs and Metropolitan
LIFETIME PRICE PROTECTION PLAN
If at ANY TIME after you make your purchase from Hansen Wholesale, you find a better price from an online competitor for the exact same item, Hansen Wholesale will refund the difference to you upon verification and qualification based on the Price Guarantee Terms and Conditions stated below.
Is the price I see on your website the Lowest Price?
The prices posted on our site are not necessarily what you will pay!
The prices posted on our site are typically the lowest price manufacturers will allow us to advertise online. Although most of the manufacturers we represent do not allow us to publish prices on our website below what you see, some will allow us to offer you a better price if you call to place your order. In most cases, trade customers are entitled to further discounts based on quantities or their relationship with us as a buyer. Ultimately, this is one of the best reasons to buy from us, because we are one of very few websites that actually prefers to take orders over the phone. This affords us greater flexibility in pricing than our competitors. It also allows us to customize many of our products to fit your needs more so than if you were forced to choose options based on the limitations of a shopping cart. The prices we have posted for items made by Minka Aire, Minka Lavery, George Kovacs and Metropolitan are the lowest price we can offer either online or over the phone unless you qualify as a trade account.

Thanks for choosing Hansen Wholesale!
5 YEAR FREE REPLACEMENT PARTS PLAN - CEILING FANS
This is an exciting new policy we created and launched on March 31st 2009. This plan is for Ceiling Fans only and applies where indicated on select ceiling fan product pages. This policy does not apply to purchases made before March 31st 2009
Basically, it covers things that are not normally covered by the manufacturer's warranty. These are actually the most common problems that people have with ceiling fans, which is most likely why the manufacturer's don't want to cover them. Here they are:
- Broken Glass     - Broken Blades     - Broken Blade Holders     - Hand Held Remote Controls (transmitters & receivers)
We are proud to say that we will replace any of these at NO COST to you within the first 5 years after your purchase based on our Replacement Parts Plan!
And YES...we are referring to cases where you are trying to clean the glass and you accidentally drop it, or you are sweeping the floor and you accidentally hit your fan with a broom handle and break a blade. This is a very lenient policy subject to the following limitations:
For starters, this policy only applies to ceiling fans that were purchased from Hansen Wholesale on or after March 31st 2009. If you did not purchase the fan from us, then please do not try to get parts from us under this policy...we will not allow it as it is only for our own customers.
You can only use this policy 1 time for each of the above listed parts for each ceiling fan that you purchased. That means if you break the glass on your fan, we will replace it free the first time. If you then break a blade or blade holder on a subsequent date, we will replace the blade or blade holder 1 time...etc.
So, for example...let's say you have kids that like to throw baseballs in the living room and...since you know you can get a free glass shade on your ceiling fan if it breaks, you tell them it's ok to aim for the ceiling fan glass and break it. Well, in this case, we will be more than happy to replace the glass the first time for FREE, but only the first time. If they break the glass again, then you are on your own. However, if they aim a little wider and break off one of your blades, then we will replace the blade FREE the first time...and so on. Ultimately, we would hope you would be more careful and never need to use this policy since it does come directly out of our pocket (this is not a manufacturer's backed policy...it is our own).
This policy does not apply to normal wear and tear for items such as changes in the color of finishes, warping or bending of blades...particularly when used in moist areas where they are not recommended (hint...buy the right blades for the application). What does qualify is when you actually break something as described above.
Hand Held Remote Controls: You do not have to physically break your remote control for this policy to apply. This policy does in fact cover the actual remote control transmitter and receiver either one simply becomes defective. Actually, most manufacturer's cover their remotes for 90 days to 1 year. So, by purchasing your fan from us, we extend that coverage to 5 YEARS!
In the even that your remote stops working, there are several steps we will go through in order to determine whether the problem is the transmitter or the receiver or both. We will rarely replace both the transmitter and receiver at the same time, unless the manufacturer suggests that as the best alternative. Before we replace a transmitter or receiver, you must be sure to replace the batteries in the transmitter first. If it still does not work, you will need to change the dip switches on both the transmitter and receiver to a different setting (which usually resolves remote control problems). Our customer service department will walk you through these procedures to try and resolve your problem before we in fact decide to ship you a new control or receiver.
The total retail value of items that we will replace FREE under this policy is $100.00 for each customer or residence. We believe this is a very liberal limitation and will more likely than not cover all of your needs for at least 5 years.
In order to process any claim, you will simply need to call our customer service department so that they can authorize the return of the broken or defective item. Yes, you will need to send it to us so that we can verify its condition as well as make sure we order the correct replacement part. Once approved, you will be given instructions for shipping the item back to us that needs replacement.
In the event that the part you need is no longer available from the manufacturer, we will have no obligation to supply any alternative parts under this policy. However, our customer service department will do everything possible to help your resolve your problem, but we will not be able to fabricate something out of nothing.
We will not cover the shipping charges for returned items coming to us or replacement parts being sent to you. The charge for shipping will be quoted based on current UPS shipping rates at the time your replacement is sent.
5 YEAR FREE REPLACEMENT GLASS PLAN - LIGHTING
This is an exciting new policy we created and launched on September 18th 2012. This plan is for Lighting Fixtures only and applies where indicated on select Lighting product pages. This policy does not apply to purchases made before September 18th 2012
If you happen to break a glass shade or crystal from any lighting fixture you purchase at Hansen Wholesale, we will replace it FREE of charge within the first 5 years after your purchase based on the limitations of this plan. So if some kids get a little too rambunctious and just happen to throw a baseball into your nice beautiful chandelier and break several pieces of glass or crystal, you need not worry. Just send us a picture of the broken fixture and we will be happy to replace the broken glass or crystal under the following conditions: We will cover the cost of the replacement glass piece(s) providing the replacement price is less than 20% of the total price you paid for the fixture and not more than $100.00 for each customer or residence. If the replacement cost is higher than this, you are welcome to pay the additional. You will be responsible for any shipping costs. Limited to one replacement claim per order. Applies only to cases where the necessary replacement glass are still available from the manufacturer. Applies only to glass or crystals...does not apply to light bulbs and other parts or components.
2 YEAR FREE EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN - GAS LOGS (up to $100.00)
This is an exciting new policy we created and launched on September 18th 2012. This plan applies to *Complete Gas Log Sets only purchased on or after September 18th 2012
Most of the R. H. Peterson gas logs we sell come with a manufacturers lifetime warranty for the logs, and up to 10 years on the burners. But the actual functional parts such as control valves, remote control transmitters and receivers only have a 1 year factory warranty, which is the industry standard. Although such components used by R. H. Peterson are the highest quality in the industry, there is always the potential for failure and replacement parts or repairs beyond the 1 year warranty period can be expensive. Gas Log manufacturers limit the warranty for these items to 1 year because they do not actually make these parts and have less control over their reliability. When you buy any complete R. H. Peterson gas log set from Hansen Wholesale, we automatically extend the warranty for ALL gas log components for an additional 2 years for a total warranty of 3 years instead of 1. We will cover the cost of the replacement parts up to $100 or 20% of the total price you paid for the complete log set, whichever is less. So not only will we make sure you get the lowest price for your R. H. Peterson gas log set, we'll also give you more peace of mind of with an additional 2 years of worry-free warranty coverage above and beyond what you would get anywhere else. Just another reason to buy your gas logs at Hansen Wholesale.
*A complete gas log set consists of both logs and a burner system. Purchases of logs only or burner kits only do not qualify for this plan. Limited to one warranty claim per gas log set.
FREE SHIPPING - Orders over $49
Free Shipping sounds great doesn't it?
As of 8/4/2014 our FREE Shipping minimum order has been reduced to orders totaling over $49 (it was previously $150)
FREE Shipping is limited to items that are shipped via standard UPS or FedEx ground in the Contiguous USA (this excludes Alaska, Hawaii). FREE Shipping does not apply to the following: Oversized items or items that must be shipped via common carrier (see "Trucked Items" below), custom items unless otherwise noted on our website, trade account orders that have special pricing, price matched orders where the overall delivered price has been reduced to match or beat a competitors price where the competitor has a shipping charge, and items with unusual dimensions or packaging that require special handling. Multiple orders cannot be combined to meet the over $49 minimum for free shipping. If you need to add an item to an existing order and all or a portion of the order has already shipped, free shipping will not apply for the new item/order unless it is over $49. Call for details!
Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii or anywhere outside the contiguous USA
FREE Shipping does NOT apply to Alaska and Hawaii or any other country or territory outside the contiguous United States!
Although our shopping cart allows orders from Alaska and Hawaii to be processed with apparent free shipping, these are exceptions that we must handle manually. If you place an order to be shipped to Alaska or Hawaii in our shopping cart, we will contact you with a separate quote for shipping. If you do not wish to pay the shipping cost, we will cancel your order before it is processed. If you live anywhere else outside the contiguous USA, please call us for a shipping quote.
Trucked Items
Items that are shipped via Freight Truck that are indicated as Free Shipping will usually be delivered to your curbside. We allocate $250.00 total for delivery of freight items to the curbside under our Free Shipping policy. If the cost to ship an item to your curbside exceeds $250.00, we may choose to have the item delivered to a freight terminal near you and you will be responsible for either picking the item up from the terminal or contracting with a local delivery service to pick up the item and deliver it to your home. We do not place a restriction of $250 for delivery to a terminal. If the shipping cost exceeds $250 for delivery to a terminal, we cover that additional cost. If there is an additional charge required to deliver an item to your curbside, we will contact you prior to processing your order and give you a freight quote so you can decide whether or not to go forward with your order. The same holds true for any item shipped outside of the contiguous USA. Additional charges can be expected if you live in a remote location, a location with unusual or difficult access, or location that requires a ferry.
*PRICE GUARANTEE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These terms and conditions apply both to our Guaranteed Lowest Price policy and our Lifetime Price Protection Plan!
This policies do not apply to items being sold by private parties or unauthorized dealers. We will not price match ourselves. All items must be the identical brand and model number offered by an authorized dealer in an original new unopened factory sealed box.
We will not match or beat prices of discontinued items, liquidations, used or refurbished merchandise, items priced below manufacturer's allowed pricing policies (see below**), items being sold by auction or items being sold at or near our actual cost. Items being compared must be in original manufacturer's sealed boxes and have identical part numbers.
Offer only applies to items that are shipped via standard ground shipping. If an item has a lower price from a competitor, yet shipping charges are higher from the competitor, we will compare the overall delivered price. If a competitor has a lower shipping charge than ours, we may or may not adjust our shipping rate based on the cost to ship to the final destination. Price matches are always before applicable
sales tax. Price match refunds are limited to one refund per item. Offer is subject to change without notice.
**Excluded Manufacturers: Some manufactures have UMRP (Unilateral Minimum Resale Price) or other pricing policies that dealers must adhere to in order to maintain their status as a dealer for certain products. As a responsible dealer, we will not violate these policies and therefore will not match prices that are below the price defined by the manufacturer if they have such a policy. Such brands include (but are not limited to): Minka Aire, Minka Lavery, George Kovacs and Metropolitan
COVID 19 SHIPPING DELAYSWarehouse closures, social distancing and limited staff may cause unexpected shipping delays on items shipped directly by manufacturers.
