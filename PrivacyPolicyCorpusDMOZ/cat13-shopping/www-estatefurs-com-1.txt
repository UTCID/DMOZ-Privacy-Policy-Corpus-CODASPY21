To determine sizing, each item has a Details section that shows detailed measurements for some of the garments. Below is an explanation of how these measurements are taken. If you have a coat that fits you well, you can hang it on a door and take these same measurements for comparisons. Slight alterations can be made once you decide to purchase.
