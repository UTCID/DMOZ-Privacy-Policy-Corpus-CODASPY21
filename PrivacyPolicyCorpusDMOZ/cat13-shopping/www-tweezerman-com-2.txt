DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION, JURY TRIAL AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND LIMITATION
Neither you nor the Company will be able to sue in court in connection with a dispute involving the Site (a “Site Dispute.”) All Site Disputes must be resolved through individual (non-class) arbitration. You indicate your acceptance to these Terms of Use, including this agreement to arbitrate, by continuing to use the Site after having the opportunity to review these Terms of Use.  You and the Company intend for this to be an agreement for arbitration that can be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.A. §§ 1–16.  You and the Company waive any rights to maintain other available resolution processes for Site Disputes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. You and we waive any right to a jury trial for Site Disputes.  Instead of suing in court, we each agree to settle Site Disputes only by arbitration. The rules in arbitration are different. There’s no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in the agreement as a court would.  Any Site Dispute shall be determined by arbitration in Nassau County New York before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. If for any reason, JAMS cannot or will not provide this arbitration, the parties may ask any court of competent jurisdiction to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we retain the right to bring legal proceedings in any jurisdiction where we believe that breach of these Terms of Use is taking place or originating. To the extent a party commences any action with includes both Site Disputes and non-Site disputes, consideration of the non-Site disputes shall be stayed until the Site Disputes are fully arbitrated. Then, any non-Site disputes will be considered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  You agree that you will not file a class action against us and our affiliated companies, or participate in a class action against us and our affiliated companies, in any Site Dispute. You agree that you will not file or seek a class arbitration, or participate in a class arbitration against us and our affiliated companies, in any Site Dispute.  Any cause of action by you with respect to the Site (or any information, products or services related thereto) must be instituted within one (1) year after the cause of action arose or be forever waived and barred and all actions shall be subject to the limitations set forth in these Terms of Use.
