About Scale:
When considering the scale of a model it is best thought of in terms of a ratio (1:18) or a fraction (1/18). The scale is exactly that, 1/18th the size of the car./vehicle that it represents. All of the manufacturers of our scale models seek to maintain the accurate proportions of the model in every aspect.
Approximate sizes:
1:64 scale (Matchbox size): 1.5” – 2”
1:43 scale: 3” – 5”
1:24 scale: 5” – 7.5”
1:18 scale: 8” – 11”
1:12 scale: 12” -16”
These sizes are estimates and not meant to be exact. The exact size of the scale model will depend on the actual size of the model it represents. Example: A 1:24 scale Corvette model will be smaller than a 1:24 scale Rolls Royce Phantom
