Flammability
Most synthetic fabrics will melt or burn if exposed to flame or direct heat. These fabrics are not fire resistant/retardant and we advise not to use them when engaging in any activities where you may be exposed to direct heat or flame.
Knives
Knives are intended and sold as collectibles and for legitimate sporting purposes only. The purchase, use, and ownership of knives are subject to a wide variety of local and federal government laws and regulations. Certain knife styles, blade designs, and blade lengths are restricted in certain areas. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to investigate and comply with laws and regulations that apply in their specific area. In addition, government and law enforcement officials may take the position that knives are "weapons" under applicable laws. Triple Aught Design is not responsible for the actions of purchasers of our knives.
