Effective March 29, 2020.
Please read carefully! These Terms of Use set forth important details about your relationship with Sears, including the rights you grant to Sears, restrictions on how you can use this web site, and our agreement to resolve disputes via binding arbitration without resort to class action litigation.
This web site or mobile application (the " Site") is owned and operated by Transform SR Holding Management LLC, on behalf of itself and for its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Transformco", "Sears", "We", or "Us"). By accessing, using, registering for, or purchasing merchandise from the Site, you agree to be bound by these terms of use (the "Terms"). All visitors to and users of any aspects of the Site (collectively, "Users") are bound by these Terms. Sears reserves the right to modify the Terms at any time without prior notice to you, and therefore, Sears recommends that you read these Terms carefully each time you use the Site. By signing in or registering to use the Site, you accept all the provisions of these Terms. If you are unwilling to be bound by these Terms, you should not access, use, register for, or purchase merchandise from the Site.
Please note that the guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions of service and use of other web sites affiliated with Transformco may vary from these Terms. If a Transformco affiliate has separate terms of use for its website(s), or a separate agreement governing its use, the provisions of the affiliate site's terms shall control in the event of a conflict with these Terms. Except as supplemented or superseded as described herein, these Terms apply to the entire network of Transformco Sites, and control your use thereof. Except in the event of a conflict, as described in this paragraph, these Terms apply in addition to any other policies or agreements that may apply to you related to any contests, sweepstakes, rewards or loyalty programs, surveys, transactions or purchases of goods or services, or other engagements you have with the Site.
Eligibility
The Site is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 18. By using the Site, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. If you are not at least 18 years of age, do not access, use, register or purchase merchandise on the Site. In the event we become aware you are under 18, we will terminate your registration. Some merchandise offered for sale on the Site may be restricted for sale to persons of a certain age (depending on the state or jurisdiction of residence) and we will require you to submit or provide valid proof of your age before purchasing or receiving age-restricted merchandise.
Privacy
Sears believes strongly in the protection of the privacy of Users and our customers. Our data collection and use practices are set forth in our Privacy Policy, which we encourage you to review.
Changes to the Site
You agree and understand that the Site, including any and all features available via the Site and any User Content (as defined below), may be modified by us, in our sole discretion, at any time without prior notice. Unless expressly stated otherwise, any new features, new services, enhancements or modifications to the Site implemented after your initial access to the Site shall be subject to these Terms. We do not actively monitor, and undertake no obligation to monitor or modify, any reviews, information, content, data, text, links to third party websites, User profile information, sounds, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials uploaded or made available via the Site by or on behalf of any User (all such items provided by or on behalf of Users, collectively, "User Content"). Nonetheless, we reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action, including legal action, in our sole discretion, against anyone who violates these Terms, including without limitation, by removing any User Content posted in violation of these Terms, terminating the registration of such violators or blocking such violators' use of the Site.
Registration
In order to access some features of the Site, you may be required to register and to select a password and user name, which shall consist of an email address you provide ("User ID").

By registering, you will also be enrolled as a member in the Shop Your Way program and must agree to the Program Terms and Conditions for Membership in the Shop Your Way Program available here. If you register, you agree to provide us with accurate and complete registration information, and to inform us immediately of any updates or other changes to such information. For example, you may not: (i) enter, select or use a false name or an email address owned or controlled by another person with the intent to impersonate that person, or (ii) use as a User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than yourself without appropriate authorization. Failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph shall constitute a material breach of these Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account. In addition, we reserve the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a User ID in our discretion.
Security

Sears further reserves the right to cancel multiple orders of any limited quantity item purchased by the same User and/or shipped to the same delivery address. Commercial use of the Site is expressly prohibited. Sears reserves the right to cancel any orders that it determines in its sole discretion are made for commercial resale purposes.
Sears may display advertising prints for products sold through a Site. Sears attempts to display the colors of the products shown on the Site as accurately as possible. However, we cannot guarantee that the color you see matches the product color, as the display color depends, in part, upon the monitor used by you.
Pricing errors may occur on the Site from time to time, on items sold by Sears, or items sold by third party sellers on Sears Marketplace. Sears attempts to correct all pricing errors as soon as they are discovered, or as soon as Sears receives notice of an error. Sears reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Sears. Any payments you make to Sears for orders that are cancelled due to pricing errors will be refunded.

Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to make changes at any time to these Terms. Any modifications to these Terms will be effective upon posting. You agree to review the Terms periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Terms.
Confidential Arbitration
You agree that by entering into these Terms, you and Sears are each waiving the right to go to court to assert or defend your rights under these Terms and the ability to participate in a class action.
ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND SEARS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SITE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDERS MADE FROM THE SITE, SEARS ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL AND MOBILE SMS (TEXT) MESSAGES SEARS SENDS TO YOU, OR RELATING TO THE COLLECTION OR USE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE), THESE TERMS, OR YOUR STATUS AS A USER WILL BE SUBMITTED TO CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN WHICH YOU RESIDE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE, IN ANY WAY, VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE ANY COMPANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.
Any User who intends to seek arbitration must first send to Sears, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice must be mailed to 3333 Beverly Road, Hoffman Estates, IL, Attn: Arbitration Intake and copied to Transform SR Holding Management LLC, 3333 Beverly Road, Hoffman Estates, IL 60179, Attn: General Counsel. The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought. If we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.
All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrators award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration brought under, or with respect to, the Site (including, without limitation, any Sears advertisement or disclosure, any email or mobile SMS (text) message that Sears sends to you, the collection or use of any information about you in connection with the Site), these Terms or your status as a User is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless Sears and you agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one Users claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.
For arbitration claims you assert against Sears in accordance with this section (but not for any arbitration claim against you) Sears will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrators fees and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside. Sears will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyers, experts, and witness fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims during the arbitration. The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partys individual claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.
YOU WILL NOT AGREE TO ACT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST SEARS IN ANY COURT, OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SITE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDERS MADE FROM THE SITE, SEARS ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL AND MOBILE SMS (TEXT) MESSAGES SEARS SENDS TO YOU, OR RELATING TO THE COLLECTION OR USE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE), THESE TERMS, OR YOUR STATUS AS A USER. THIS SECTION (CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION) WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND SEARS.
Sears or you may seek injunctive relief in any state or federal court in Chicago, Illinois, USA, and Company and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in Chicago, Illinois, USA for injunctive relief purposes.
Applicable law
By visiting the Site, you agree that the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Sears.
Miscellaneous
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Sears in any respect whatsoever. We may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Site. These Terms, which shall be deemed accepted by you upon your use of the Site, constitute the entire agreement among you and Sears regarding use of the Site. Sears' failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of the enforcement of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is deemed to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms shall be unaffected and shall continue to be fully valid, binding and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you, except with our prior written consent. The headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms include and incorporate by reference the Privacy Policy for the Site and any notices regarding the Site.
