We only collect personally identifiable information from our visitors
when our visitors voluntarily submit such information and we always request
that children ask their parents or teachers for approval before sending
us any personally identifiable information. We may request such personally
identifiable information, in complete compliance with the Child Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in connection with contests, sweepstakes,
games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions,
chats, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for
free products or services and visitors' requests for additional information.
For example, we may collect the following personally identifiable information:
the visitor's name, e-mail address, age, and town.
The Allegro Rainbow management requests that children ask their parents
or teachers for approval before sending personally identifiable information
to us, we also recommend that parents and teachers become involved in
monitoring and supervising their children's online activities, and recommend
that parents and teachers become sophisticated in the availability and
use of commercially available software and other tools that may enhance
children's online experiences in manners that reflect the preferences
of parents and teachers.
Unless we indicate otherwise, personally identifiable information will
be used solely by the Allegro Rainbow management or its agents for internal
