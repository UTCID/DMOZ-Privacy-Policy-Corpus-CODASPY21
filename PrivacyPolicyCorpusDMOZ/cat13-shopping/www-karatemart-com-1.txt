IMPORTANT: KarateMart.com is an online retail store that sells brand-new items.

However, once an item loses it's brand-new status,
it no longer has any value to us, and is therefore not returnable.

guidelines, no refund or credit will be issued.
We will contact you and attempt to make arrangements to have your package
returned to you.
Â

Click HereÂ forÂ the ReturnsÂ &Â Exchanges Form
Â
If you are having trouble viewing the returns & exchanges form, you probably need to download the free Adobe Reader software at Adobe.com.

protect ourselves.
KarateMart.com and it's employees are committed to customer service and will make every possible effort
to make your experience with KarateMart.com a positive one!
Returned Packages:
If your package is returned toÂ KarateMart.com marked as "refused", "unclaimed", or "undeliverable", and you would like to have it re-shipped, we will unfortunately need to charge you for the shipping amount it costs us to ship it back to you.Â Â
Â
How to cancel your order:
Please call us immediately if you need to cancel your order. Due to the speed in which why try to ship all orders, we may not be able to cancel an order once it has been submitted but if you call quickly it is possible under certain circumstances. If you have any other questions, please contact a Customer Care Representative.Â
Â
Check your order status:
You can check the status of your order anytime by going to the Account page. Even if you didn't create an account when placing your order, you can still check your order status as long as you have your Order ID and shipping zip code.
Â
The majority of packages are delivered by the day indicated when the package is tracked.
The tracking page will alert you to delays due to weather or other unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances.
Please make arrangements to receive your package when it is delivered.
A common practice is to have your package delivered to your place of business. Businesses typically send and receive much more mail than private residences and are available during the day to receive shipments. If you aren't home during the day to receive you package, consider having it sent to your work.
Â
My Tracking Number Says "Delivered", but I don't have my package.
Now What?
Â
If your package was handled by a local post office or delivery service, the tracking information may indicate that your order has been delivered once it arrives at the local post office or delivery services facility.
However, your package may still be one or two days from being delivered to your address.
Please be patient. In the vast majority of cases, the tracking information has been updated early and your package should arrive soon.
Â
If, after a few days your package still hasn't been delivered, go through the following checklist before calling customer service to make absolutely sure that your package is actually missing.
Â
Make sure no one else has accepted delivery on your behalf.
Check with family members, roommates, apartment managers, building personnel, mail room, front desk, concierge or anyone else who may have accepted delivery on your behalf.
Check the area surrounding the delivery location.
Often, well-meaning delivery personnel will inadvertently hide a package from its intended recipient by placing it in a concealed location safe from potential thieves. Check side porches, rear entrances, in and around garages, and behind bushes or outdoor fixtures.
Check Your Mailbox.
Many of the packages that we send are delivered by the US post office and are placed in the normal mail receptacle. Please make sure your order isn't in your mailbox.
This happens quite often.
If you live in a complex where the mailboxes are grouped together, be sure to check your mailbox for the key that will open the large Parcel Locker. The Parcel Locker is almost always found attached to the smaller mailboxes. This is where you will almost always find larger packages that have been delivered by the US Postal Service.
Check for a Mail Hold.
Make sure that the Postal Service isn't holding your mail.
If there is a mail hold attached to your name or address, your mail will not be delivered.
Check for a Notice of Attempted Delivery.
Make sure that there isn't a notice from the Post Office on your door, in your mail box, or P.O. Box. If you find a notice follow the directions on it to request re-delivery.
Contact the carrier.
If your package was sent using the post office and you have the same mail-carrier everyday, you should contact that person and find out if they have any information about your package.
Â
If you have gone through this list and still don't have your package, please contact customer service at 1-800-977-6928 or via email at Service@KarateMart.com
Â
Claims:
You must notify us within 15 days from the date of your order if not received.
Â

We offer wholesale accounts to martial arts instructors and school owners.
