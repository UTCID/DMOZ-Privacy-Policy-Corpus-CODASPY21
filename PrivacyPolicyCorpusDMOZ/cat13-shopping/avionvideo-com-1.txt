Privacy & Security
Like all on-line retailers, we have a duty to safeguard your privacy and the information you give us.
This is what we do:
Privacy
We never pass on any of the information you provide, to third parties.
Security
Our card payment processing facility is provided by Stripe, a Company that achieves the highest standard of internet security required by banks and card-issuing companies.  None of your card details are received by Avion Video.
You can also pay with PayPal, one of the world’s leading card payment processors and again Avion Video doesn’t receive any card details.
We don’t store your phone number on our order processing system.
If you order by post or by phone, any written record of your card details is shredded at the end of the working day.
