We will email your sales receipt and tracking information when you make a purchase through our website. We only email our fans for marketing purposes if they have specifically opted-in to receive marketing emails. Every marketing email we send includes a link to opt out of future emails.

New Equipment
If you find any item on our website available for a lower price elsewhere, contact us. We will meet or beat any verifiable price from an authorized dealer.*
*Tube prices are non-negotiable. Period.
Used Equipment
We accept offers on our inventory of used equipment that does not have a posted price. (Don't low-ball us. We won't respond.) We do not accept offers on used equipment that has a posted price; these items are priced according to market value and will sell.
Package Deals & Trades
We create package deals for our customers that cannot be beat. And, we take trade-ins! Contact us for expert consultation when making any upgrades to your system.Whoa, partner! Looks like you are outside of North America!
Apologies, as we do not sell vacuum tubes internationally. We have limited stocks of vintage tubes and use them to attract equipment sales. So we sell only to customers with a matching billing and shipping address who reside in the USA, Canada, or Mexico. We do not ship to freight forwarding companies or your friend or cousin, even if they are in the USA. There are no exceptions, so please don't ask. We won't respond. Sorry for that.
If you are interested in equipment (not tubes) and are outside of North America, we may sell to you at our discretion. Contact us and let us know what you want as we do not process international orders online. Wire transfer is the only accepted payment method for international orders.
Good luck in your HiFi adventures!
