Wow, that was quick
Hello,
My order was just delivered by Fedex. Wow. That is really FAST delivery. Plus, it is raining right now and as soon as it stops I can install them. No more breaking my plants. I had to move two plants because of the problem. One had no effect to transplanting and is flowering. The other appears to be springing back and am hopeful it is not lost.
Thank you so much for the fast shipment & delivery.
Sincerely,
Laurel Dobbins
