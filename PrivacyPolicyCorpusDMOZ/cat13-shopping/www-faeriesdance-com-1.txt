Charitable Giving
FaeriesDance.com is committed to having a positive effect on our world. From opening day we've been donating 1% of all before-tax income to charity. For more details and to see a comprehensive list of the charities we've chosen to support, check out our Charity page.
Our Pricing
We want to make natural and environmentally conscious fabrics available to as many people as possible. To that end, we price our domestic merchandise at least 10% off the manufacturer's retail price. While we can't keep track of every sale, you will consistently find lower everyday prices at FaeriesDance.com than most other online retailers, including the manufacturers own webstores. Please note, due to large fluctuations in international exchange rates, it's nearly impossible to make the same claim about products we purchase from overseas vendors.
Privacy Policy
FaeriesDance.com is in the business of selling natural fiber clothing, NOT e-mail addresses. We are a small, family-run business that has an aversion to getting spam and unsolicited e-mail. Your right to privacy is important to us, so our privacy policy is very straight-forward. We simply will NOT give, rent, sell or trade your e-mail address to any third party. Your address and credit card information are sent only to our card processing bank via a secure, encrypted connection for verification and credit approval. No other parties ever see your personal information. FaeriesDance.com maintains an opt-in e-mail newsletter that provides subscribers with special offers and discounts. The newsletter is delivered to your inbox once a month. You may add or delete yourself from that list at any time, at your discretion.
To read the full, legal version of this policy along with a complete list of what cookies are captured by Magento, our ecommerce platform, see our Privacy Policy page.
Security Information
PCI COMPLIANCE
FaeriesDance.com maintains Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance.
We are monitored and audited by a third-party PCI compliance company.
You can check our PCI compliance status by clicking on the link on our checkout page. These links are updated in real time, and are positioned directly under the Place Order button.
Here's what they look like.
ENCRYPTED DATA TRANSMISSION
We use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Our SSL certificate supports both standard 128-bit (used by most banking infrastructures) and high grade 256-bit encryption to secure online transactions and safeguard your personal information. SSL encodes your data so that it is unreadable by unauthorized parties during transmission. Look for a "padlock" icon in your browser's status bar as an indication that a secure session is in progress.
You can click on the padlock to get more information.
Here are some examples of what to look for.
The one on the left is Microsoft Edge, and the right is Google Chrome.
CREDIT CARD STORAGE
FaeriesDance.com does NOT store your credit card information anywhere on our website or in a database.
Your card data is transmitted via our secure, encrypted connection immediately upon checkout directly to Authorize.net for approval. Credit card information is not even stored temporarily on our site. This eliminates any threat, regardless of how unlikely it may be, of having our database hacked or having your card number stolen from our internal computers.
Of course, if you leave the checkout page without completing the order, you will need to re-enter your card information since it is never stored.
We think this is a very small price to pay for that extra layer of security.
Backorders
We keep close watch on inventory levels to provide a smooth, convenient shopping experience for all of our customers. Despite our best efforts however, we may occasionally run out of a certain size or color. If one of the products you purchase is backordered, we will notify you immediately with an estimated delivery time. You will have the option of waiting for the incoming shipment, changing your order to a different color or size, or canceling your order at no charge to you.
