FAQ
Dear Customers,
When you place an order with us, we request your name, phone number, billing address, shipping address, credit card number and expiration date and three digit check code in the signature panel. We consider this information to be private, and we keep this information on a secure server to protect it. We use the information only for the limited purposes of processing your orders, administering our site, notifying you of products or special offers that may be of interest to you (only if you select to be included on our email mailing list). We do not share your private information with anyone. Prices, specifications and availability are subject to change without notice.
Buffalo Arms Co.
Selecting the correct shipping method for your shipment.
Selecting a shipping method that is best suited to your shipment is very important. Not all items can ship using all methods. In addition flat rate shipping has box size limitations. This means not every order can fit in a flat rate box. If the shipping method the customer chooses for his or her shipment is not viable for the order, Buffalo Arms reserves the right to choose a more suitable shipping method.
Some shipping carriers are now charging $50 for refused shipments, The customer will be held responsible for this fee. Carriers are charging us $20 for change of addresses so if you change your shipping address after a package is shipped there is a $20 fee.
Domestic Shipments
We will ship your order as promptly as possible.  All firearms, unless antique, require shipment to a Federally Licensed Firearms Dealer. We will need a signed copy of your dealers FFL license either by E-Mail, Postal Mail, or Fax.  It is the customers responsibility to follow all Federal, State and Local laws on all products shipped. Handguns can now be shipped via the U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail insured for about $25-$32. If you ask us to partial ship your order for any reason, you will have to pay shipping for the second shipment.
It is the customers responsibility to follow state and local laws when ordering.
Attention Massachusetts Customers: Please feel free to order, however if you order brass, bullets or ammunition we have to ship them to an FFL dealer in your state! Or we can ship to you if you have a C&R license or a FID (Firearms Identification Card) or a LTC (License to Carry Card).
Attention Illinois Customers: Please feel free to order, however if you order a muzzleloader we have to have a copy of your FOID card per the Illinois State Police Firearms Bureau.
Attention California Customers: Ammunition can be shipped to FFL dealers, active duty law enforcement and FFL dealers with a current certificate of eligibility issued by the Department of Justice pursuant to Section 26710.

Damaged Shipments
If your order arrives damaged, it is the customer's responsibility to report this to the shipping company. You must also retain the shipping container and packing material for the shipper's inspection. By not promptly reporting the damage or loss to the shipping company, then you have accepted the shipment as is without further recourse.

Foreign Orders
If your order has brass, bullets, guns, gun parts or any item that can not be shipped without an export permit we will automatically remove these from the order and ship the balance with out contacting you. Shotgun hulls are excluded from these regulations.
Duties and taxes may apply to your order and are paid by the customer. We have no control over the amount of duties and taxes your country charges you.
Due to the additional time it takes to put together an international shipment there is a $2 per package handling fee on each foreign order. If the country we are shipping to does not allow us to fully insure the parcel and in the unlikely event of a parcel being lost or damaged then it is the customer's loss. This has never happened but you should be aware of the possibility.
If for any reason your package is returned to us by the shipping company the customer will have to pay for all shipping charges. We will ship Global Express Mail or FedEx International Express to all foreign countries. We may select the best method of shipment. Calculated shipping prices shown on the web when ordering are not always accurate for any foreign countries.
In regards to International Shipping Quotes: We have tried many times in the past to give our international customers an accurate shipping quote, but due to the complexities of international shipping we are unable to provide our shipping cost until after we process the order and charge the customer.
Firearms, barrels, projectiles, and conversion cylinders can be exported through one of our exporters. Due to current regulations the fee charged for export service typically runs $450 and up for one shipment.
