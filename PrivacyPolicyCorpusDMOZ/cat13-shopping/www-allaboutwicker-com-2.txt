Terms and Conditions of Use
Terms and Conditions of Use
Introduction:
AllAboutwicker (AllAboutWicker.com) shall be referred to herein as AllAboutWicker, Big Business Incorporated, "we", "us", or "our" and the terms “you” and “your” refer to you as a user of this website. These terms and conditions govern your use of this website; by using this website, you accept these terms and conditions in full. If you disagree with these terms and conditions or any part of these terms and conditions, you must not use this website. If you are under the age of 13 years old please do not use this website. By using this website and by agreeing to these terms and conditions you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age.
Freight Shipments:
Large items will need to be shipped via freight truck which means you will be contacted to schedule a delivery time once the order has shipped. Someone will need to be available to inspect and sign for the delivery. You must inspect the packaging cartons to see if there are any signs of damage, then inspect the furniture itself to confirm it has been received in good condition. Once you sign the bill of lading the driver presents to you or if you instruct the delivery company to leave it without inspection you will be responsible for any damages and we will not be able to refund or exchange any merchandise or place a claim on your behalf to the shipper. Damage during shipping is a rare occurrence, but it can happen so we will need you to inspect the order before signing the driver delivery slip that everything has been received in an acceptable condition.
Cushion Orders:
If you are ordering cushions you need to verify the sizes needed and either you have received fabric samples from us or realize that the colors shown on our online fabric charts may differ from the actual fabric colors. Cushions are not returnable as all cushions are custom manufactured for you in our factory in the fabric and sizes ordered.
Returns:
Most items with the exception of custom orders and clearance items are returnable. Please contact us to verify if your item would be returnable before you place an order.
All returned items must be in new unused condition, packed in the original box and or packaging and are subject to a 15% restocking fee. Shipping charges to and from customer are not refundable.
Special order, custom and clearance items are nonreturnable.
Since different computer monitors display colors differently we strongly suggest ordering fabric swatch samples before ordering especially if you are trying to match your decor. We are not responsible in color variations between website images and fabrics.
Damages:
All damages on freight shipments must be reported and notated with the shipper when the shipment arrives and before the driver leaves. No damage claims can be submitted once the delivery driver leaves. Ground shipment damages must be reported the day of delivery and all the original packaging must be retained in order to be picked up and inspected by the carrier. Items without their original packaging cannot be returned.
All damaged items subject to return and or pickup by carrier must be placed back in all the original packing and prepared for pickup before the shipper arrives to pickup.
Items not packaged properly for return cannot be picked up by the shipper and therefore cannot be credited.
