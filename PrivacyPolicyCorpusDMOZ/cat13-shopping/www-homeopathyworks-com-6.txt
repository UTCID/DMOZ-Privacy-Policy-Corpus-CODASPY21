Shipping Policy
Standard shipping packages will be delivered by USPS or UPS at WHP’s discretion unless otherwise specified by the customer. Customers using a PO box address must use USPS. Rates are as follows:
$4.99 (orders up to $49.99)
$7.99 (orders between $50–$99.99)
Free shipping (all orders $100 or more)
Next Day, 2-Day, and 3-Day shipping options by UPS are available for all products with the exception of those with high alcohol contents. Due to the high alcohol percentage of these products, they are required to be transported only by ground transportation and only within the continental United States. A physical address is required for all expedited shipping requests; no PO boxes.
We ship Monday–Friday within 2 business days of order receipt. Cut-off time for express shipping is 1 PM EST. Express shipping delivery excludes holidays and weekends. Please call WHP to check on Saturday delivery availability for your address.
International shipping is available for all products with the exception of those with high alcohol contents. Please contact a customer service representative for any international inquiries.
Non-receipt of items sent to overseas addresses will be non-refundable. WHP does not guarantee delivery of international items. Duties and taxes, if applicable, shall be paid by the customer.
