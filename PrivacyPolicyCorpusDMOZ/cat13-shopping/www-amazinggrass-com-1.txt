In the event any term contained in these Terms conflicts with any other term contained in any other agreement referenced in these Terms, these Terms shall control. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, these Terms may only be modified in a writing signed by an authorized officer of Company. The language in these Terms shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.

You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

You may not assign these Terms or any rights granted herein. Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder is void. Company may assign or transfer these Terms or its rights or obligations hereunder without notice and without your prior approval. These Terms are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and do not create any third-party beneficiaries, whether intended or incidental. These Terms will inure to the benefit of Company and its successors and assigns. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under these Terms will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
Governing Law
THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, INTERPRETATION, AND PERFORMANCE OF THESE TERMS WILL BE EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, EXCEPT AS TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS, AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS CONTRACT IS NOT A CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF GOODS; THEREFORE, THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE GOVERNED BY ANY CODIFICATION OF ARTICLE 2 OR 2A OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, OR ANY CODIFICATION OF THE UNIFORM COMPUTER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT (“UCITA”), OR ANY REFERENCES TO THE UNITED NATIONAL CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS.
Injunctive Relief
You hereby acknowledge that a breach of these Terms may cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Company that may be difficult to ascertain, and that a remedy at law may be inadequate. Accordingly, you agree that Company shall be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies otherwise available to Company at law or in equity and without the necessity of posting bond, to seek injunctive and other equitable relief in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by you. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Arbitration
Except in the case of legal action brought by Company to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief of whatsoever kind, all of which may be brought in any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THEIR SUBJECT MATTER, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION LOCATED IN, OR CLOSEST TO, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, AND WILL BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION TO OCCUR IN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SAID ARBITRATION TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES, IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ARBITRATION, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNING SUCH ARBITRATIONS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS. SUCH ARBITRATION MUST BE FILED WITHIN TWELVE (12) MONTHS OF THE FIRST ACCRUAL OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BROUGHT PURSUANT TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR RELATING TO A DISPUTE WILL BE TWELVE (12) MONTHS FROM THE FIRST ACCRUAL OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY STATUTE TO THE CONTRARY. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
The arbitration will be heard and decided no later than seven (7) months after the notice of arbitration is filed with the American Arbitration Association by one arbitrator. The arbitrator will hear and determine any preliminary issue of law asserted by a party to be dispositive of any claim, in whole or in part, in the manner of a court hearing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or for summary judgment, pursuant to such terms and procedures as the arbitrator deems appropriate. No witness or party may be required to waive any privilege recognized under California law. The hearing will not last longer than four (4) days unless all parties agree otherwise, with time to be divided equally between you and Company. The arbitrator will be an attorney, licensed to practice law in the State of California for no less than ten (10) years, with no less than five (5) years’ experience as an arbitrator. The parties and the arbitrator will treat all aspects of the arbitration proceedings, including, without limitation, discovery, testimony and other evidence, briefs, and the award, as strictly confidential and not subject to disclosure to any third party or entity, other than to the parties, the arbitrator, and the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator must give full effect to the applicable law and to all of these Terms, and is specifically divested of any power to add to, subtract from, modify or alter any of the terms or conditions of these Terms, or to render decisions in derogation thereof. The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual direct damages, except as may be required by statute. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE WAIVING THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator will issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive upon all parties involved, and judgment upon any decision of the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state courts with jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Service. Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other users of the Service.
Attorney Fees
In any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding by which one party either seeks to enforce its rights under these Terms (whether in contract, tort, or both) or seeks a declaration of any rights or obligations under these Terms, in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses to resolve the dispute and to enforce the final judgment.
Legal Compliance
You agree to comply with all local laws and rules regarding use of the Service. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms. The Service is controlled and operated by Company from its offices in the State of California, in the United States of America. Company makes no representation that any of the Service (including, without limitation, any products or services available on or through the Service) are available or appropriate for use outside of the United States of America. Your use of or access to the Service should not be construed as Company’s purposefully availing itself of the benefits or privilege of doing business in any state or jurisdiction other than California.
U.S. Export Laws
This Service and/or products offered on the Service may be subject to the export laws, restrictions, regulations and administrative acts of the United States Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), State Department, and other United States authorities (collectively, “U.S. Export Laws”). Users shall not export or re-export, or allow the export or re-export of, the Service and/or products offered on the Service in violation of any U.S. Export Laws. None of the Service or products offered on the Service may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders, or any other denied parties lists under U.S. Export Laws. By using the Service, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are not a national or resident of, located in, or under the control of, any restricted country; and you are not on any denied parties list; and you agree to comply with all U.S. Export Laws (including “anti-boycott”, “deemed export” and “deemed re-export” regulations). If you access the Service from other countries or jurisdictions, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for compliance with the local laws of that jurisdiction, if and to the extent those local laws are applicable and do not conflict with U.S. Export Laws. If such laws conflict with U.S. Export Laws, you shall not access the Service. The obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms or your use of the Service.
Government Users
All software, if any, licensed pursuant to these Terms and related documentation are “Commercial Items”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (i) only as Commercial Items and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other users pursuant to these Terms.
Severability
If any provision(s) of these Terms,including without limitation, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect. The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration clause; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the arbitration clause (but only the arbitration clause) shall be null and void.
Section Titles; Survival
The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Sections 3 through 8 and 10 through 22 of these Terms, as well as any payment obligations to Company, shall survive any termination of your account, your access to the Service, or these Terms.
Legal Equivalency
These Terms and any other electronic documents, policies and guidelines incorporated herein shall be: (i) deemed for all purposes to be a “writing” or “in writing,” and to comply with all statutory, contractual, and other legal requirements for a writing; (ii) legally enforceable against any party hereto as a signed writing; and (iii) deemed an “original” when printed from electronic records established and maintained in the ordinary course of business. Any electronic documents introduced as evidence in any judicial, arbitration, mediation or administrative proceeding shall, if established and maintained in the ordinary course of business, be admissible to the same extent as business records in written form that are similarly established and maintained.
