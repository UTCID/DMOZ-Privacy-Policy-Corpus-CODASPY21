FAQ(Frequency Asked Questions).This

This
website was created to answer some of the questions The Pinball
Resource normally gets.Q)
Why doesn't The Pinball Resource Have their own Web site?A)
We do now!Q)
How come all of the parts are not listed on this Web
Site/Catalog?A)
The Pinball Resource has millions of parts. It would require
multiple people to maintain a web site/catalog of this size. This
web site is a start, if successful, watch it grow!
Q)
How come part XYZ is not available for my game?A)
Pinball machines were only meant to last on location for 5 years.
Thus parts were only maintained by the manufacturer for this time
period. The Pinball Resource has had many parts re-manufactured
for this very reason.Q) How
come this web site is ???A) We
sell Pinball Part and run the web site like our business, simple
and to the point. There are no banner ads, no tracking, no
cookies, just pinball/coin-op related information.Q)
Do you sell or repair Pinball Machines!A)
Sorry, we don't.
