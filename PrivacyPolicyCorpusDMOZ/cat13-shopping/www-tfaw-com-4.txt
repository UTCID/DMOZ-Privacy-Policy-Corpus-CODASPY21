Privacy Policy
Please keep in mind that if you're using this site, you are agreeing to the Privacy Policy of Things From Another World, Inc. (TFAW.com).
This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect about our customers on our Website, in our stores, and through interest-based online advertising. The Privacy Notice also describes how we may use that information, how we protect that information, how we share that information, your choices and options regarding the information, and how you can contact us regarding our privacy practices.
Information we Collect
We may collect certain personal information from you in connection with your activities at TFAW.com, such as when you shop on our website or in our stores. This information may include:
Payment card or other financial account information;contact and billing information (including name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number);date of birth;geolocation data; andother personal information you provide to us on our Website, in our stores, or when you interact with us in other ways, both online and offline.Additionally, we or companies acting on our behalf may collect certain computer and browser information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons when you visit our Website. A "cookie" is a file that a website sends to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
The information collected using these tools may include your IP address, browser characteristics, operating system, the address of the web page that referred you to our Website, dates and times of Website visits, the language your system uses, and the country and time zone in which your device is located. These automated technologies also permit the collection of "clickstream data," which may include a log of content you access while browsing a website.
Companies acting on our behalf may combine the information collected from your visit to our Website with other information they have collected previously. Your web browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict, reject or disable certain cookies.
Interest-Based online Advertising and Google Analytics
This section of our Privacy Notice provides details about interest-based online advertising (also called "targeted advertising", "remarketing", or "behavioral advertising"), Google Analytics, and your choices with respect to this type of advertising.
We use Google Analytics' 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on other websites because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising here and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads preferences at https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated. Because those opt-out and preference control pages are specific to the individual browser used to visit it, and because those pages are not operated by TFAW.com, we are unable to perform the opt-outs on your behalf.
