Social Media Promotion Terms and Conditions:1. By participating in a Performance Audio Twitter/Facebook Promotion, you fully agree and accept these Standard Twitter/Facebook Promotion Terms and Conditions as well as any individual terms and conditions of the specific prize draw.2. Performance Audio Twitter and Facebook prize draws are open to residents of the 48 contiguous states, U.S.A., aged 18 and over only, excluding Associates of Performance Audio or employees of companies involved in the prize draw and their associated, affiliated or subsidiary companies, their families, agents, or anyone connected with the relevant prize draw.3. To enter Twitter promotions, entrants must have access to the internet and have a genuine Twitter account. Entrants must follow to be eligible to enter Performance Audio Twitter promotions.4. To enter Facebook promotions, entrants must have access to the internet and have a Facebook account. Entrants must 'like' Performance Audio (perfaud) on Facebook to be eligible to enter Performance Audio's Facebook promotions.5. The winner or winners will be drawn at random from all eligible entries received during the course of the prize draw. The number of winners in any promotion and the prizes available will be confirmed within the entry details for that promotion. Entries are only valid if the entry is completed correctly in accordance with the specific promotion Terms and Conditions. Performance Audio will conduct the draw, whose decision in all matters relating to the prize draw is final. No correspondence will be entered into except with prize winners.6. Only one entry per person, per social media account in any promotion.7. No purchase is necessary to enter, unless otherwise stated.8. Entry in a promotion closes when stated in the entry details for that particular promotion. Entries received after closure will not be counted.9. Winners will be notified via the Social Media platform that the prize draw was run on via a private message and/or email, if supplied. Winners' names (at Performance Audio's absolute and sole discretion) may be announced on the Performance Audio Facebook page, website and/or Twitter account. Winners must therefore 'like' or 'follow' the account in order to be contacted about prizes. Prize winners will be notified after the prize draw (which will take place within 7 days of the promotion closing date) via a reply to the entrant's public comment submitted to enter the prize draw. Winners must then provide a postal address to which their prize should be delivered within 48 hours via private message. Failure to respond to the notification or acknowledge the win within the claim period of 48 hours (unless an alternative period is provided for in that promotion's Terms and Conditions) will invalidate that winner's claim and their prize will be forfeited. In these circumstances, Performance Audio will select an alternative winner from all remaining entries in that prize draw.10. In order to receive their prize, a winner is required to provide Performance Audio with their full name and a valid address located in the lower 48 states, U.S.A.11. Prizes are as stated, are non-transferrable and no cash alternatives are available. Performance Audio reserves the right to award alternative prizes of equal or greater value in the event that advertised prizes become unavailable for any reason.12. When dates for claiming a prize are specified, such dates cannot be altered and by entering a promotion where the prize relates to a specific event which is date-specific, Performance Audio or the third party prize supplier are not liable in any way to any winner who cannot attend the prize event for any reason.13. Performance Audio will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of entries and Performance Audio does not accept responsibility for entries which are not received for any reason, or for any prizes which cannot be delivered due to an incorrect or inaccurate address having been provided by the winner. Except where indicated otherwise in a specific promotion's Terms and Conditions, prizes will be received within 28 days of receipt by Performance Audio of a winner's address details.14. Performance Audio will collect personal data about entrants online, in accordance with our privacy policy. Performance Audio will not share your details with any third-party companies or organizations.15. Performance Audio reserves the right to amend or temporarily suspend a promotion in the event of any unforeseen circumstances, or technical reason outside of its reasonable control, with no liability to any entrants or third parties.16. By participating in a Performance Audio promotion, participants accept either Facebook's or Twitter's terms and conditions (as the case may be, depending on their route of entry) although it is acknowledged that such Performance Audio promotion is not sponsored or endorsed by, nor associated with Facebook or Twitter. Participants entering release Facebook or Twitter (as the case may be, depending on their route of entry) from any and all liability arising out of or in connection with their entry in a promotion.17. In the event that Performance Audio believes that an entry contravenes any of these Terms and Conditions, it reserves all rights to disqualify that entry at its absolute and sole discretion.18. These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by US law. Performance Audio reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions for this competition at any time without notice.
