Build-A-Bear Workshop Global Privacy Policy - effective September 4, 2020
The Build-A-Bear Workshop family of companies respects your privacy, and we will do our best to earn and keep your trust. All Personal Information that you share with us is treated with the utmost care. Build-A-Bear Workshop has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of all our guests from all over the world. This Privacy Policy identifies what Personal Information we collect when you visit our stores or use our websites or other online services, what choices you can make about your Personal Information, how we use this data, and how we protect your Personal Information, and applies to all Personal Information provided to us in our stores or through our websites or other online services.
Except for the Build-A-Bear “Play” website, which is intended for all ages, the Build-A-Bear websites, including but not limited to the “Shop” website, are not intended for children under 16 years of age and are for adults only. Build-A-Bear does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children’s products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use our websites only with the involvement of a parent or guardian (except for the Build-A-Bear “Play” website, which can be used by people of all ages).
Build-A-Bear Workshop complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, including the Supplemental Principles (collectively, the “Privacy Shield Principles”), as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union (the “EU”) and the United Kingdom (the “UK”) to the United States (the “U.S.”) in reliance on Privacy Shield. Build-A-Bear Workshop has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability, as well as the Supplemental Principles.

A list of companies that are currently certified under the Privacy Shield is available at www.privacyshield.gov/list.
In light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield Principles as a legal basis for transfers of Personal Information relating to individuals in the EU or the UK. Therefore, we also process Personal Information submitted relating to individuals in the EU and the UK via other compliance mechanisms to ensure appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information as described in Article 46 of the GDPR, including data processing agreements incorporating the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. Our Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and we are committed to responding promptly to inquiries and requests by the United States Department of Commerce for information relating to the Privacy Shield Principles.

Yes. Personal Information is required to create a certificate at the Name Me® station in the store.
Is my child’s Personal Information shared with unrelated third parties?

What Personal Information did my child share while attending a party?
Parental supervision is always recommended; however, parents often do not attend a party with their child. Children attending a party may create a certificate at the Name Me® station. A certificate can be created with just the animal’s name and the child’s first name, gender and year of birth.
Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties
We employ other companies (“Agents”) and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share, and may internationally transfer, your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, ExactTarget (SalesForce). Other types of Agents with which we may share Personal Information include organizations providing services to support Build-A-Bear Workshop functions, such as our mail and email processing companies, payment processing companies, and market research firms. We also transfer Personal Information to Agents for email marketing purposes. If Build-A-Bear Workshop transfers Personal Information subject to the Privacy Shield Principles to a third party, the recipient will have the same level of protection as required of the Build-A-Bear Workshop under the Privacy Shield. All such service providers are bound by contract to refrain from using the Personal Information we collect from you for any purpose other than providing the service to Build-A-Bear Workshop. Build-A-Bear Workshop is liable under the Privacy Shield Principles for its Agents to process transferred Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Principles.
We may also disclose information (including Personal Information) collected from guests outside of the U.S. to affiliated companies or Affiliates in the U.S. and elsewhere. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc., whether by ownership or otherwise. Any Personal Information relating to you that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Privacy Shield Principles and other compliance mechanisms to ensure appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information as described in Article 46 of the GDPR, including data processing agreements incorporating the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. We train our employees and those of our Affiliates about the importance of privacy and how to handle and manage customer Personal Information appropriately and securely. We may share your information (including Personal Information) with franchisees of Build-A-Bear Workshop, but only where we indicate to you at time of Personal Information collection that such Personal Information will be provided to a franchisee, or if we otherwise obtain your permission.
In addition to disclosures to third party providers and Affiliates as described above, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, product lines or divisions, or any financing or acquisition. We may also disclose Personal Information to prevent damage or harm to us, our Services, or any person or property, or if we believe that disclosure is required by law (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or in response to a lawful request by public authorities. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not otherwise disclose Personal Information to third parties unless you have been provided with an opportunity to opt in to such disclosure.
Build-A-Bear Workshop does not release the Personal Information it collects from you to any unrelated third parties so that they may send you commercial promotions or offers for products or services. Build-A-Bear Workshop does not engage in the sale of your personal information. We do, however, share anonymous, aggregate information concerning the demographic makeup of our customers to unrelated third parties, and share Personal Information as described below.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not otherwise disclose or sell Personal Information to any third parties unless you have been provided with an opportunity to opt in to such disclosure and, in the case of Personal Information collected from children, the appropriate verifiable consent is obtained.
If an individual wishes to opt out or limit the use and disclosure of their Personal Information to a third party or a use that is incompatible with the purpose for Personal Information was originally collected or authorized, the individual may send such request to privacy@buildabear.com.
When Build-A-Bear Workshop transfers Personal Information to countries other than the country where it was provided, we do so in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including, as applicable, the Privacy Shield Principles. In light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield Principles as a legal basis for transfers of Personal Information relating to individuals in the EU or the UK. Therefore, we transfer Personal Information relating to individuals in the EU and the UK via other compliance mechanisms to ensure appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information as described in Article 46 of the GDPR, including data processing agreements incorporating the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. All Personal Information is transmitted to World Bearquarters in St. Louis, Missouri daily. Copies of the Personal Information at the point of origin are deleted on a regular basis. We may transfer Personal Information from guests outside the U.S. to Affiliates located either in the U.S. or otherwise; provided that transfers to the U.S. from the EU will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles and such other compliance mechanisms in all respects.

Privacy Shield Dispute Resolution
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Build-A-Bear Workshop commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Build-A-Bear Workshop‘s Privacy Officer, , who will, in accordance with Build-A-Bear Workshop‘s Incident Response Policy and its Data Protection Retention Policy, as applicable, escalate it as necessary, at:

Suspected and confirmed Personal Information security incidents will be investigated by the Privacy Officer and/or other personnel as necessitated by the scope of the incident. Such investigation will include, but will not be limited to, determining the source of the breach, identifying the types of data affected, determining whether notifications must be made and instituting any remedial measures that may be necessary to avoid similar incidents in the future.
Build-A-Bear Workshop has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to The Information Commissioner’s Office of the United Kingdom (the “ICO”), the Data Protection Supervisory Authority for the United Kingdom. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit https://ico.org.uk/concerns/eu-us-privacy-shield/ for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the ICO are provided at no cost to you. Under certain limited circumstances, EU or UK individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint.
The FTC has committed to reviewing, on a priority basis, referrals alleging non-compliance of the Privacy Shield Principles received from independent dispute resolution bodies, among others. If the FTC concludes that it has reason to believe Section 5 of the Privacy Shield Principles has been violated, it may resolve the matter by seeking an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting the challenged practices or by filing a complaint in a federal district court, which if successful could result in a federal court order to same effect.
Use of Human Resource Personal Information Subject to Privacy Shield
Where a member of the Build-A-Bear Workshop group in the EU or UK transfers Personal Information about its employees (past or present) collected in the context of the employment relationship, to a parent, affiliate, or unaffiliated service provider in the U.S. participating in the Privacy Shield, the transfer enjoys the benefits of the Privacy Shield. In such cases, Build-A-Bear Workshop will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, make reasonable efforts to accommodate employee privacy preferences, and will not use employees‘ exercise of their rights under Privacy Shield to restrict employment opportunities or take punitive action against employees. In light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18, Build-A-Bear Workshop does not rely on the Privacy Shield Principles as a legal basis for transfers of Personal Information relating to individuals in the EU or the UK. Therefore, Build-A Bear Workshop transfers Personal Information about its employees (past or present) collected in the context of the employment relationship relating to individuals in the EU and the UK via other compliance mechanisms to ensure appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information as described in Article 46 of the GDPR, including data processing agreements incorporating the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
Build-A-Bear Workshop collects Personal Information from its employees to administer employee evaluations, payroll, compensation surveys, benefits, and its Employee Discount Program. Build-A-Bear Workshop will comply with all relevant laws, and, as applicable, the Privacy Shield Principles and other compliance mechanisms to ensure appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information as described in Article 46 of the GDPR, including data processing agreements incorporating the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, in the collection and use of employee-related Personal Information. To the extent and for the period necessary to avoid prejudicing the ability of Build-A-Bear Workshop in making promotions, appointments, or other similar employment decisions, we may not offer employees the notice and choice options described in the Privacy Shield Principles. Similarly, for occasional employment-related operational needs, such as the booking of a flight, hotel room, or insurance coverage, transfers of Personal Information of a small number of employees may take place with limited access or the entering into a contract with the third-party transferee, provided that we otherwise comply with the Privacy Shield Principles or such other compliance mechanisms, as applicable. Access must also be limited in the context of employee security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with employee succession planning and corporate re-organizations.
Where employees in the EU or UK make complaints about violations of their Personal Information protection rights and are not satisfied with the results of our internal review, complaint, and appeal procedures, they will be directed to the state or national data protection or labor authority in the jurisdiction where the employees work. Build-A-Bear Workshop commits to cooperate with competent EU or UK Data Protection Authorities in the investigation and resolution of Privacy Shield complaints with regard to human resources Personal Information transferred from an EU country or the UK to the U.S. Build-A-Bear Workshop will comply with any advice given by the Data Protection Authorities where such authorities take the view that we need to take specific action to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles.
