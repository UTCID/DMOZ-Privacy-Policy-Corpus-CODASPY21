Privacy Policy
PartRequest.com is committed to helping you find quality used auto parts online
while ensuring the protection of your privacy. We've developed the most robust and
secure part locating services on the Internet. In fact, we are the only used auto
parts locator that allows you to remain anonymous when you place your request.
Here is what you should know about our Privacy Policy
In order to submit a used auto parts request to our network of salvage
yards, junk yards and other used auto parts vendors, you are required to provide
us with your email address and some other personal information, including your
name and the city, state and zip or postal code where the part will be shipped if it is
purchased from one of our vendors. You are not required to provide us with a
phone number and your are not required to provide us with a street address.
The information that is required from you is needed in order to provide our
subscribers with enough information so they can reply to you after you place a
part request. At no time do we provide your email address to any of our salvage
yards (see below for details about our anonymous email feature). In addition,
each subscriber has agreed to the terms and conditions of our
Subscriber Agreement which states, in part, that each subscriber is required to keep
all information that they receive through our service confidential.
Remain Anonymous!
Unlike other services that are out there, we will NOT provide your email address
to anyone, not even the salvage yards that receive your part request. Other used
part locators send your request to their subscribers by email, indicating that the
request came from your email address. This means that someone you're not sure you can
trust has your email address stored somewhere, and has the ability to send you spam or,
worse, sell your email address to someone that operates a spam factory. In fact, we
tested our competition and found that our email address was sold to a third party
that continues to send us spam. This will NOT happen when you use PartRequest.com to
find used auto parts. We process and distribute your part request differently.
Our proprietary email system keeps your email address safe with us so you don't
have to worry about receiving spam. We send out your part request anonymously and all
communications from the salvage yards that sell used parts through our service are
tracked and logged for your privacy and convenience.
If you believe that your privacy has not been maintained as a result of your
use of our web site, please contact our support team immediately.
Information we may collect
Information we may collect and store on our servers includes: (1) your
email address; (2) your name; (3) information about the automobile for which
a part request is placed, including the year, make and model of the
automobile; (4) the city, state and zip or postal code where the part will be shipped if
it is purchased from one of our vendors; (5) information about the part(s)
being requested; and (6) your phone number if you decide to provide it.
How we store collected information
Information that you provide us is transmitted via Secure Socket Layers
(SSL) using up to 256-bit encryption, depending upon your browser. We employ
state-of-the-art best practices to ensure the information you provide us is
kept private. We do not store credit card information or any other sensitive
information on our servers.
