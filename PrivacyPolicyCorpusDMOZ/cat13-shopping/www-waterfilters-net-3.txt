Liability Disclaimer
WaterFilters.NET has made it easy for its customers to find filters through our site. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the consumer to choose the correct water treatment system or filters for their unique situation. WaterFilters.NET may offer explanations of water treatment technology and may give common solutions to common water problems. However, WaterFilters.NET does not recommend or suggest a particular water treatment system for a particular application because WaterFilters.NET is not able to have all necessary information regarding a particular application. For example, WaterFilters.NET does not know which contaminants are in the customer's water, nor does it have information on all variables surrounding their unique situation. WaterFilters.NET is a passive reseller and is not subject to product liability. The manufacturer alone is liable for damages resulting from products that WaterFilters.NET sells.
Consumers agree to hold WaterFilters.NET harmless for any product liability caused by improper system selection, manufacture, design, or installation. We reserve the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time without notice.

Order Acceptance Policy
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. WaterFilters.NET reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason or to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. If part or all of your order is cancelled by us for any reason, a complete refund will be issued for the portion of the order cancelled.

Other Conditions

Out-of-Stock Products
We will ship your order as soon as it becomes available. Most orders ship the same or next business day depending on when your order is received. However, there may be times when a product you have ordered is out-of-stock, which will delay fulfilling your order.
