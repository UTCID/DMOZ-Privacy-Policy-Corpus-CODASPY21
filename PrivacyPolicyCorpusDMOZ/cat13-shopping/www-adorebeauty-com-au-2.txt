protect the information from misuse, interference, loss or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure both physically and through security methods; and
destroy or permanently de-identify the information if it is no longer needed for any purpose.

In your request, please make clear what personal information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information deleted from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will comply with your request within a reasonable period after you make your request.
