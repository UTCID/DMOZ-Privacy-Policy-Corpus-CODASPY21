Terms Of Use
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SECTION LABELED “CLASS-ACTION WAIVER AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION” BELOW CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS IN ANY DISPUTE WITH US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR YOUR PURCHASE AND/OR USE OF ANY SERVICE OR PRODUCT.
Welcome! We’re glad you’re here and thank you for selecting the services that we offer through our websites, mobile applications or by telephone (the “Services”). As the developer of the Services (“we,” “us” or “our”), we want to provide you with some guidance as to our terms of use for the Services set forth below (these “Terms”). By registering or otherwise accessing, downloading, installing, using and/or partaking of the Services, as the case may be, you are agreeing with all of these Terms.
Registration
Our mobile apps require that you register and set up a user account to use the Services. We make registration optional by way of a Guest Checkout option, if you prefer. By registering or otherwise accessing, downloading, installing, using and/or partaking of the Services, you represent and warrant that (a) you are at least eighteen (18) years of age and (b) you have provided us with true, accurate and current information about yourself during the registration process (including, without limitation, your name and valid email address). You acknowledge that erroneous information may lead to an inability for you to complete your transaction. You represent and warrant that you will provide and maintain true, complete and current account information, and keep your email address and phone number valid as long as your account remains active. Registration data and other information that you provide are governed by our Privacy Policy. You may not access or use the Services in any manner if you are younger than eighteen (18) years old.
By providing your contact information to us, you agree that we may contact you in connection with your account and/or orders.
You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account and for ensuring that you exit or log out of your account at the end of each session of use. Your password is confidential, and you may not give it to anyone else. You will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or password or any other breach of security that is known or suspected by you.
Mobile Services
Certain of the Services are available via a mobile device, which may include, without limitation (a) the ability to upload content to the Services, (b) the ability to browse the Services and (c) the ability to access certain features through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, the “Mobile Services”). To the extent to which you access the Services through a mobile device, your wireless service carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and it may be the case that not all Mobile Services work with all carriers or devices. By using the Mobile Services, you acknowledge and agree that certain information about your usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us.

We are in the business of offering personalized products (the “Products”).

You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or otherwise exploit any part of the Services or Products except as permitted by these Terms, and you may not access or use the Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Any use of the Services other than as expressly authorized in these Terms is strictly prohibited. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are hereby expressly reserved by us.
By submitting Your Content to us, you grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid-up, transferable, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute copies of, publicly perform, publicly display and otherwise use and exploit Your Content for the limited purpose of providing the Services and promoting other services to you that we believe will be of interest to you. You represent and warrant that you either own Your Content or have a written license or other valid permission from the applicable intellectual property rights owner(s) (for example, and without limitation, your photographer) to make Your Content available to us for use with the Services and on the Products you order.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, you acknowledge that we will need to work with Your Content in order to provide you with the Services and the Product. For example, and without limitation, we will copy, and we may need to display and/or modify, as well as stream, upload, post, publish, display, email or otherwise transmit or use (hereinafter, “Transmit”), Your Content when making the Products, and we will distribute Your Content when shipping the Products to you. By the license granted above, you are giving us permission to do this and, because we are using Your Content to provide you with the Services and the Products, you will not charge us any royalty. We will retain Your Content on our servers so that it will be available for your future use. This will make it easier for you to reprint entire orders or to use elements of Your Content in making Products for new orders, all without the need to upload Your Content again. We agree that our use of Your Content will be limited to the scope of the Services and the Products that we provide. And rest assured that we will never use Your Content to market, promote or advertise the Services to others without your express written permission.
We reserve the right to reject any or all of Your Content if we determine, in our sole discretion, that Your Content is inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the exercise of good judgment. For example, and without limitation, we may reject any of Your Content that we believe would fall within the Prohibited Uses of the Services set forth below.

Cookies
Our websites use “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that reside on your device and identify you as a unique user. Cookies allow us to, among other things, measure activity and personalize your experience. For example, and without limitation, cookies enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a username or password. Cookies also allow us to track your status or progress when ordering Products from us. If you choose, you can set your device to reject cookies, or you can manually delete individual or all cookies on your device. However, if you reject or delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features on our websites. We also use other common information-gathering tools such as web beacons and embedded web links.
Payments
To the extent to which the Services and/or the Products or any portion thereof are made available for any fee or charge (including, without limitation, shipping and handling charges), you will be required to select a form of payment and provide us information regarding your credit card or other form of payment authorized by us. You represent and warrant that such information is true and correct and that you are authorized to use the selected form of payment. When you make a payment, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor(s)) to charge the full amount to the payment source you designate for the transaction. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, and without limitation, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You will pay us all fees and charges incurred in accordance with the authorized form of payment and these Terms. If you dispute any fees or charges, you will let us know within sixty (60) days after the date that we invoice or otherwise charge you, and give us the opportunity to remediate any problem which you believe entitles you to dispute those fees or charges. You hereby grant to us the right to fix any payment processing errors that we may discover, and the right to correct any such processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the transaction found to be in error.
Returns & Refunds
We want you to be 100% satisfied with your experience with the Services and the Products. If within the first thirty (30) days you are not completely satisfied with your order, we will either (a) provide a replacement in the case of a defect or (b) in all other cases, issue a complete refund, subject to the exceptions and restrictions listed below:
Refunds are limited to amounts actually paid by you. This does not include the promotional value of any special offer or discount.
In cases where the return/refund is due to your order arriving damaged or with a defect confirmed by us, we will in our sole discretion either (a) provide you with a prepaid return shipping label or (b) reimburse your cost of return shipping. For all other cases, return shipping costs are your responsibility. Shipping and handling charges may apply to Services and Products that are otherwise offered on a free or promotional basis.
All orders receiving bulk/wholesale pricing are final, and no refund will be given except in the case of material damage or defect upon your order’s arrival. If the damage or defect cannot be verified over the phone or via email contact, you may need to return the item to us for inspection before a determination can be made as to a potential refund. Please be sure to request and carefully review digital proofs when placing a bulk/wholesale order.
In addition to the above satisfaction guarantee, we also offer a limited lifetime warranty against defective workmanship on all our canvas wall décor Products, if such defective workmanship causes a canvas wall décor Product to be unusable for its intended purpose in a way that did not exist in the first thirty (30) days after you received it.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states that: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him would have materially affected his settlement with the debtor or released party.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you hereby waive any comparable statute or doctrine.
Privacy Policy
The terms of our Privacy Policy are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.
Class-Action Waiver and Agreement to Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS RIGHTS THAT YOU MAY OTHERWISE HAVE. IT PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THAT YOU AND WE MAY HAVE WITH EACH OTHER BY USING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, WHICH IS FINAL AND BINDING. IN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND POTENTIAL FOR APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT. THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE WILL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM MADE BY YOU AGAINST US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SERVICE AND/OR YOUR PURCHASE AND/OR USE OF THE PRODUCT(S), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DISPUTE OR CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, PRODUCTS LIABILITY, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY (TOGETHER, A “DISPUTE”) WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
Either you or we will have the right to elect to initiate binding arbitration to resolve any Dispute by providing the other party with written notice of such election. You and we each hereby agree, and agree in the further to take all steps required, to waive the right to litigate any Dispute in court, be it by way of court trial, jury trial or class action, and agree that: (1) such arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “Rules”), which are available here or by calling +1-800-778-7879; (2) the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules; (3) the language of the arbitration will be English; (4) the arbitration will be conducted near the location where you reside; (5) we each hereby irrevocably consent and submit to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue as such for the purposes of arbitrating any such action; (6) the arbitrator in such arbitration will be without jurisdiction to conduct a class arbitration or other representative proceeding, and may not consolidate one person’s claims with another; (7) all issues of enforceability of this arbitration provision, including, without limitation, issues relating to scope, validity, and unconscionability, will be decided by the arbitrator; (8) the entirety of any arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we will have any right to disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (9) payment of all arbitrator compensation, expenses, and administrative fees (which include, without limitation, filing and hearing fees) will be governed by the Rules; (10) each of us will bear our own fees and costs related to any arbitration, including, without limitation, the expense of our respective counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration; and (11) notwithstanding (9) and (10) above, the arbitrator will have the right to re-allocate his or her compensation, expenses and/or administrative fees, as well as your and our fees and costs related to the arbitration, if he or she determines that a claim, defense and/or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.
WHETHER IN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OR COURT, YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PROSECUTE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU AND WE MAY EACH SEEK RELIEF ONLY ON OUR OWN BEHALVES, AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REMEDY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS A MATERIAL AND ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.
In the event that this arbitration provision is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, a modified provision will be substituted that carries out as nearly as possible your and our original intent as evidenced solely by the language above, and the validity, legality and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If for any reason this arbitration provision is deemed inapplicable, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, you and we each hereby waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any right to a jury trial, any right to recover punitive or exemplary damages, and any right to pursue any claims on a class, collective,
or consolidated basis or in a representative capacity.
Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.
Miscellaneous
We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, effective immediately upon posting here. Any updates, new services or modifications of existing services will be governed by these Terms. The continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance to such changes. We strongly encourage you to periodically review these Terms. All prices and features of the Services and the Products are subject to change without notice.
We reserve the right to modify, discontinue or suspend, temporarily or permanently, any of the Services (or any part thereof) and/or the Products, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, discontinuance or suspension of any of the Services or the Products.
Any communication we receive from you will be considered NOT to be confidential (other than information we may agree to keep confidential under our Privacy Policy). By sending us any information (other than information we may agree to keep confidential under our Privacy Policy) you grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute copies of, publicly perform, publicly display and otherwise use and exploit that information.
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us governing your use of the Services and the Products. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms or any other terms or conditions available elsewhere regarding the Services and/or the Products, these Terms will prevail and be given precedence.
The waiver of any right under these Terms will not operate as past, present or future waiver of that right or of any other right. No waiver will be effective in any case unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
In the event that any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, a modified provision will be substituted that carries out as nearly as possible your and our original intent as evidenced solely by the language of these Terms, and the validity, legality and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or the use of the Services. We have the right to assign any or all of our rights and obligations under these Terms at any time; however, all rights that you may have under these Terms or otherwise in and to the Services may not be assigned by you.
Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to create, or be construed as creating, any third-party beneficiary right of action upon any third party, in any manner whatsoever.
The Services are offered by us, and we are located at 23801 Calabasas Road, Suite 2005, Calabasas, California 91302, USA. If you are a California resident, you may have a copy of these Terms emailed to you by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your email address and a request for such Terms.

OPEN FONT LICENSE

Preamble
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including, without limitation, any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

“Reserved Font Name” refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).
“Original Version” refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.
The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software will not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.
