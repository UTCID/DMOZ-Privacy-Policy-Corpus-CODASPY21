Privacy Statement relavent to GDPR
Melody's Traditional Music and Afghan Press Music for the Harp are under the umbrella company Melody Productions, a Texas S Corporation. Both companies sell printed harp music, both paper and digital downloads. Melody's physical store also sells harps, both new and used. Melody Productions owns the following web sites: www.folkharp.com, www.afghanpress.com, www.afghanpressmusic.com, and melodystraditionalmusic.com. The latter site is a blog site. Www.folkharp.com sells paper music, some accessories for harp, and digital downloads. Both Afghan Press sites strictly sell paper music, and mostly to wholesale accounts. By using any of the Services above, you hereby agree to the collection and use of information as defined in this Privacy Policy.
This is intended as a global Privacy Policy, for all customers/individuals using our Services, noting certain rights and principles are applicable to, and reserved for, EU citizens and the handling of their personal data (i.e. the areas that refer to the  General Data Protection Regulation or ‘GDPR’).
Responsibilities:
We consider the input of data into our software as being sufficient evidence of Informed Consent being freely given by customers for the purchase of harp print music, both paper and digital. Your information is:
Processed Lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner;
Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes;
Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary;
Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date;
Retained only for as long as necessary; and,
Processed securely in an appropriate manner to maintain security.
If you are an EU citizen whose personal information we hold, the GDPR affords certain rights. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email melodytradmusic@gmail.com to process your request securely, we reserve the right to request you to provide two valid forms of identification for verification purposes.
Your rights are as follows:
The right to be informed;
The right of access;
The right to rectification;
The right to erasure (the ‘right to be forgotten’);
The right to restrict processing;
The right to data portability;
The right to object; and,
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.
In our role as a commercial music store, we strive to uphold these rights in the manner, and to the timelines, defined within GDPR. Customers must also uphold these rights for these individuals. If we consider requests to: be frivolous; necessitate disproportionate effort to complete; or, cannot be fulfilled for another legitime reason (e.g. legal) – then we reserve the right to refuse them. If such an exceptional circumstance arises, then we will inform you (within a reasonable timeframe). If answering requests is likely to require additional time (above that specified in GDPR) or generates a commercially unreasonable expense (which you may have to meet, in part or in full), then we will also inform you (within a reasonable timeframe).
Timelines:
On matters where GDPR specifies a defined timeline, then we will strive to address them ‘within a reasonable timeline’ as recommended within GDPR.

Security:
We take the security of all data extremely seriously and utilize multiple technologies, processes and protocols to protect against the loss or theft of personal data, including (but not limited to): encryption, access controls, data backups, passwords, and reputable third parties (e.g. Paypal) et al.  This being said, although we invest at a commercially reasonable level, no software platform or data storage can be 100% secure; thus, we cannot make guarantees relating to data security. We do not sell, distribute or lease any personal information outside of our business, without obtaining Informed Consent, unless we are legally required to do so, or there is a ‘good faith belief’ such action is absolutely necessary.  For example, if Melody Productions sells or merges, then personal data will be transferred; in this case, we will provide advance notice. Disclosure could also be required to: protect the rights or assets of our business; prevent or investigate a wrongdoing related to our Services; support a legal request from a recognized legal authority; and/or, protect the safety of users of the Services et al.
