2.4.      If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the product(s). This might be because a product is out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product or because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.
3.         Our products and payment
3.1.      The images of the products on our Site are for illustrative purposes only and your product may vary slightly from those images. The product descriptions on the Site, whilst given in good faith, are subject to alteration by us without notice or any liability accruing to us.

We will process your refund within 14 days from the day on which we receive the products back and will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you used for payment.

5.3.      Please be aware that as some products sold on our website are perishable, in these cases the usual cancellation right for consumers (as set out in clause 5.2) does not apply. We are also unable to allow consumers to cancel the contract if the products bought have been personalised or customised specifically for them or according to their particular specification.
6.         Refunds and returns
6.1.      We are under a legal duty to supply products that are in conformity with this contract. If you think that any product you have received:
6.1.1.        does not match its description;
6.1.2.        is not of satisfactory quality;
6.1.3.        does not meet any relevant guarantee we have made; or

We reserve the right to ask you to send us reasonable evidence of any product affected by such issues. Consumers who notify us of issues raised under this clause 6.1 may, depending on the individual circumstances, have rights entitling them to a refund, repaired or replacement goods or be entitled to some money back.
6.2.      Nothing in these terms will affect your statutory rights as a consumer.
7.         Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you
7.1.      If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is as a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.
7.2.      We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products including the right to receive products which are: as described and match information we provided to you and any sample seen or examined by you; of satisfactory quality; fit for any particular purpose made known to us; and supplied with reasonable skill and care; and any rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
7.3.      We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the products for end users. If you use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, revenue or goodwill, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
8.         Other important terms

8.3.      Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.
8.4.      If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
8.5.      Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
8.6.      Use of your personal data.  We will only use your personal data in the ways set out in our Privacy Policy, which can be found here.
