Certain exception disclosures
We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, or Appliance Zone has good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on Appliance Zone or (2) to protect and defend the property or rights of Appliance Zone, the users of its website or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk protection. If Appliance Zone should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may transfer the information you provide to us on the Appliance Zone website to a third party we have merged with or sold our marketing rights to.
What are cookies? Why do we use them?
Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences. Appliance Zone uses cookies to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to our store. They cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personal or private information. You must accept cookies to shop at Appliance Zone.
How do we protect information we collect?
We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. Appliance Zone servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with most current browsers, so that only Appliance Zone can read a customer's personal information.
How long do we keep user information?
We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.
Your consent to this policy
By using the Appliance Zone web site, you agree to this Privacy & Security Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy & Security Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms and Conditions take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Privacy & Security Policy by posting a new version of the policy on this page which it is your responsibility to review upon site entrance.
