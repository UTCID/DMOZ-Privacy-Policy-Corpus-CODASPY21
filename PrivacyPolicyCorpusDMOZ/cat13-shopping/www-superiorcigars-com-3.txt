Cigar Terms To Top
Barrel: The main body or shank of the cigar.
Binder: Binder leaves are the intermediate leaf used to hold the bunch of filler tobacco together
Blend The mixture of different types of tobacco in a cigar, including up to five types of filler leaves, a binder leaf and an outer wrapper.
Bloom: Also referred to as plume, this is a white film or spots caused by the oils in the tobacco rising to the surface of a cigar's wrapper. It is harmless, and usually indicated a strong tasting smoke.
Blue Mold:
Peronospara tabacina is a fast moving, airborne fungus that can ruin a tobacco field in just a few days. It flourishes in cool, cloudy weather with light rain and riddles tobacco leaves with small round blemishes.
Bouquet:
The smell, or "nose," of a fine cigar. Badly stored cigars lose their bouquet.
Bunch:
The intermediate cluster of filler tobacco in a cigar
Cap: The small flag of wrapper leaf that the roller lays down and seals to the head of the cigar with a vegetable gum based glue.
Filler: The bunch of tobacco found at the center of the cigar. There are two types of filler: long filler, which contains the whole leaf running from the head to the foot of the cigar, and short filler, comprised of scraps of tobacco (often the trimmed ends of long fillers).
Foot: The end of the cigar that you light.
Hand Made: A cigar that is bunched, bound and wrapped entirely by hand with no machines being used in the fabrication process (excluding the mold).
Head: The capped end of the cigar that you put into your mouth.
Humidor: Any box used for storage of cigars in a controlled humidity. The term humidor usually refers to wooden boxes, with unfinished interiors (also see tupperdor, Igloodor)
Hygrometer: A device used for exact (?) measurements of relative humidity.
Igloodor: A (usually large) insulated storage container for cigars.
Lacioderma: Tobacco Beetle larva. Nasty destroyer of precious cigars.
Long Filler: Tobacco leaf that is long enough to run the entire length of a cigar's bunch.
Oil: The mark of a well-humidified cigar. Even well-aged cigars secrete oil at 70 to 72 percent relative humidity, the level at which they should be stored.
Relative Humidity: Relative humidity (RH) may be defined as the amount of moisture in the atmosphere as compared with that of complete saturation at a given temperature. Water exposed to air gradually evaporates until it reaches a saturation point, i.e. 100% humidity. At 21 degrees centigrade (approx. 70deg F) and a normal atmospheric pressure, the amount of evaporated water is approximately 11 grams per cubic meter at a RH of 70%. Note: DO NOT confuse relative humidity with absolute moisture content!
Ring Gauge: The diameter of a cigar's barrel, expressed in 64ths of an inch. A 32 ring is 32/64" (1/2"), for example.
Shoulder: The area where the head of the cigar meets the barrel.
Special Solution: A solution of 50 percent water, 50 percent propylene glycol. Added to your humidification device every three to six months, its presence will keep water from evaporating beyond 70 percent relative humidity.
Tooth: Those little "bumps" of oil on a fine quality Cameroon wrapper.
Tupperdor: An airtight plastic container used for storing cigars.
Vein: A structural part of a leaf; prominent veins can be a defect in wrappers.
Wrapper: The outer leaf - generally high quality, first grade tobacco that is wound around the binder of the cigar. It is chosen for its complexion, elasticity, silky texture and delicate veins.
