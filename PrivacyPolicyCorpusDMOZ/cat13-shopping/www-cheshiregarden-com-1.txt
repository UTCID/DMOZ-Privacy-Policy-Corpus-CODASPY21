Privacy Notice
All of us at Cheshire Garden want you to trust that we value your privacy as much
as we do our own. We want you to know the following:
We will never disclose your e-mail address to anyone else. We use your
e-mail address for communicating with you about your order, to
send you our newsletter if you subscribed to it, and to let you
know about important changes to our web site such as updates
to this policy.
When placing an order on our site, the information you provide is kept
private except as necessary to process your order (so that we
can bill your credit card and ship your order.)
We use various technological means to protect your credit card information
to the best of our ability. All web pages where personal information
is entered are protected by SSL encryption, which guards against
interception while you are using our web site. Credit card information is never stored on our site.
Paper records are destroyed in a secure fashion. Other
personal information, such as name, address and purchase history,
is maintained in a password-protected database.
This web site uses a "session cookie" to keep track of your shopping
cart and your order as you progress through the checkout process,
but it does not use long-term "tracking cookies" of any kind.
Our site does not use ad servers, with the exception of the site
search feature where search results have Google ads displayed
by our search service provider.
If you have any questions about what personal information of yours we have,
or if you would like us to remove all such personal information,
please contact our webmaster, Steve Lionel, at webmaster@cheshiregarden.com.
