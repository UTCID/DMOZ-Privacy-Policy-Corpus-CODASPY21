Privacy & Information
Privacy Policy
We cherish our privacy, so we found the
easiest way to create a Privacy Policy in this ever-intrusive
world is simply keep it simple! We respect our patron's right
to privacy as much as our own! We will not divulge your personal information to
any third-parties, period! The only exception is our
merchant credit card service when processing your credit card, but that
is done off server. Many of our patrons are avid breed enthusiast and
found we provide something exclusive and ask for information when we
have something new, especially in their breed. These emailed messages
are few and you can always opt out if you like. If you have comments or
suggestions with our Privacy Policy then

Credit Card Encryption
We are dedicated to protecting our customers and we have moved from shared hosting at
FatCow,
to VPS hosting at WestHost.
With VPS we full comply with PCI
DSS standards. VPS allows us better control
over our server's configuration to safeguard your privacy. We do not store any of your personal
and financial data on this server and we use our own Comdo PositiveSSL certificate
with AES-256 256 bit High-grade Encryption to secure your data during transmission. Your security is
of paramount importance to us! We do not disclose this information to any third parties, except our
merchant credit card service. See our Privacy Policy

Why We need your Phone Number in Checkout
Our merchant credit card service that we
use to process credit cards for our business has a policy for all phone
orders, mail orders, and web transactions, that a customer contact
phone number be supplied. It is a policy intended to prevent credit
card fraud and protect both us, and you! We do not give out this number
to anyone else but the bank. With custom orders, the contact
information is essential! Communication is the key to turning your idea
into a work of art! See our Privacy Policy

Why We need your Email in Checkout
A a courtesy, and for your records, a
receipt of this transaction will be emailed automatically to the email
address that you supply here. If you are paying with a credit card, of
course your card number will not be in the message! It will
only have your card type, like VISA and just last 4 digits with the
expiration date so that you may identify which card you used, and that is all. A
complete receipt will be sent with your package, except with
Gift Order,
where your receipt will be sent in a separate envelope.
Your email address is for internal use only and is not given out to
anyone else. Also with custom orders, the contact information is
essential! Communication is the key to turning your idea into a work of
art! See our Privacy Policy

Where is my CVV or CID code & why do you need it
In order to further protect you from credit card fraud, the
credit card companies have put an extra security code on your credit and debit
cards.
The Card Security Code is located on the back of MasterCard, Visa and Discover
credit or debit cards and is typically a separate group of 3 digits to the
right of the signature strip.
On American Express cards, the Card Security
Code is a printed (NOT embossed) group of 4 digits on the front
towards the right.
