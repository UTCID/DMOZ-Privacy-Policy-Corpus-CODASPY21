10 Reasons
to Buy from US
Fantastic. Under promised and over delivered. Told it would take 8 weeks, done in 5.     Delivery service did a great job. Communication from start to finish was excellent. One of the best transactions I have ever had with any furniture company or internet organization. Available for questions during the entire transaction, including after the delivery.
Jim and his grip are the way other firms could learn from. THANK YOU Bruce Bade
