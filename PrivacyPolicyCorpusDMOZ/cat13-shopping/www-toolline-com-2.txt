Privacy Policy
We are committed to protecting your privacy. This means that we will not distribute, sell or rent your name or any personal information about you to any third party without your permission. We may share non-personal, non-individual information in general form with our marketing partners for research purposes. In other words, we will not tell our marketing partners that you are a member or that you purchased a specific product, but we may tell them how many members we have or how many customers purchased that product.
We will not contact you for any reason that is not directly related to assisting you with your membership or the purchase of our products or services.
We must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.
ToolLine.com uses the latest technology to protect your credit card and checking account information and does not release this information to any outside organization other than those financial institutions that require the information for processing your order. Your orders are transmitted using SSL encryption (the Internet standard for secure transactions). This software encrypts all the personal information that you send us (including credit card numbers, names, addresses, and telephone numbers) so that your private information cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet.
