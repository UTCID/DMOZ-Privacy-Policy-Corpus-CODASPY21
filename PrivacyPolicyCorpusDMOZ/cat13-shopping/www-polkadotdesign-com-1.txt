To continue serving you best, we have supplied the following notification of what personal information is collected and how it will be used.
What kind of information does Polka Dot Design collect?
When you register with Polka Dot Design, we collect and store your email address and a secret password. This information is used to create an individual account for you. Inside your account, you have access to view your online proof for approval to print, your order history, along with receipts, shipping and tracking information. Other information is collected so that we may process your order - this includes billing and shipping address, and your contact telephone number and email address. Polka Dot Design will not sell, share or rent any information to third parties. When you personalize a product, we will ask you for information needed to complete your order.

Additionally, custom printed orders that receive a proof will receive automatic messages with proofing instructions and proof notifications each time a new proof is uploaded. Polka Dot Design will also contact you by telephone or email if we have any questions regarding your order, such as verifying your billing or shipping address, confirming your custom print options, notifying you of a backordered item or to obtain any additional information that will aid in the processing of your order.
