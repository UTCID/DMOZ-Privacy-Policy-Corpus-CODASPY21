Security/Privacy Policy
Shop with confidence knowing your personal information is secure!
We take every precaution to ensure that your personal data, including credit card information, is as secure as it can be. You can feel free to use your Visa, MasterCard, and Discover, knowing it will be safe to do so. The WTM Branding Irons site processes credit card purchases through Authorize.net™, which utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology on all pages where personal information is requested. This encryption technology prevents anyone from using your personal data if intercepted. WTM also takes every precaution when storing your credit card number in our database. In an effort to be absolutely sure we are providing a secure shopping experience for our customers, we will, from time to time, employ independent companies to conduct what is called ethical hacking to determine if there are any security concerns with our site or our customer database.
Will WTM Branding Irons sell my email address or other personal information? ...NO
Absolutely not. We use personal information provided on order forms, such as a purchaser's name, email address, physical address, and credit card number, to fulfill merchandise orders. We will send you an email confirming your purchase. That email can be used as a receipt for your records. We may also use order information to contact a purchaser when necessary, such as when a delivery may be delayed or when an ordered product is out of stock. WTM will not share any personal information without your permission with any unaffiliated third parties, unless required by law.
Can I pay by check? ...YES
If you do not have a credit card or prefer not to use it, you may pay by check or money order. During the checkout process simply choose "check" when it asks you for a payment option. Once you finish the checkout process we will receive your order electronically and begin processing your order. You then simply mail your check or money order, along with a printed copy of your order, to us.
