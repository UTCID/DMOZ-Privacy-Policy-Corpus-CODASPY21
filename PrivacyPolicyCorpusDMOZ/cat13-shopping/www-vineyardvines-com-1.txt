When will my order be shipped?
Please note that due to COVID-19 guidelines, shipping time may be impacted. We strive to process orders as quickly as we possibly can. Orders placed Monday through Friday are usually shipped within 48 hours. Please note that during periods of high volume, it will take longer (sales, major promotions, Friends & Family, during the holidays, etc.) Orders placed over the weekend are usually shipped the next business day. If you need your order to go out the same day you place it, please place your order before noon ET using an expedited service (excludes Saturday, Sunday and Holidays) and we’ll be sure to do our best to get you your merchandise in time.
When will my order be delivered?
Once processed, orders are shipped via Standard Ground (unless an expedited service is chosen). Standard Ground is delivered within 2-7 business days to most U.S. locations; however, we've found that orders will arrive even sooner than that. Please note that due to COVID-19 guidelines, shipping time may be impacted.
How can I track my order?
Once an order has shipped, you will receive an email with tracking information. This email might wind up in your "Spam" email folder, so be sure to add vineyard vines to your "safe" list.
What if I’d like to change my order after it’s placed?
We apologize, but we cannot make changes, adjustments, or cancellations to an order after it has been submitted. We may still be able to help, though! Just give us a call at 800-892-4982.
Can I ship to an address that is different from my billing address?
Absolutely! When you set up your vineyard vines account, you’re able to enter separate shipping addresses and save addresses that you may want to ship to in the future.
Why are my purchases being sent to me in multiple shipments?
You may have ordered a number of items that don’t fit into one box, or we are shipping your item from one of our store locations. You will receive an email with a tracking number and item list for each of your packages.
Please note, in order to fulfill your order to the best of our ability we sometimes ship your items directly from one of our stores which can result in multiple shipments for a single order. When this happens you may notice multiple posts to your credit card for a single order. The initial authorization is not a charge and will disappear from your account in a business day or so.

Arbitration Rules
Notwithstanding your and vineyard vines’ agreement that Missouri law governs interpretation and application of these terms generally, you further hereby agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
Unless you and vineyard vines agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms and Conditions will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.
