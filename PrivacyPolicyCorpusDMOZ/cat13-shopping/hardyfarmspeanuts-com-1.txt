Hardy Farms has been a family owned business since 1935. From supermarkets to roadside stands, Hardy Farms has been turning out the finest, glutton free peanuts around.
Due to COVID-19 related impacts on mail service providers, we are limiting shipping options to 2-day delivery and overnight delivery. While we know this may increase the shipping cost for some customers that would traditionally receive their order via ground shipping, this is our effort to ensure the quality and freshness of our product among delivery. Because of factors outside of our control, Hardy Farms Peanuts cannot guarantee any shipping on orders placed through the website. Also, FedEx and UPS are not guaranteeing any shipping for online orders. We thank you for your patience and understanding while we work through these challenges.
