The goal of our site is for you to find just what you are looking for in the least amount of clicks. And since everyone likes a deal, we've put our specials right on the homepage. We make every attempt to have IN STOCK every item you find on our site.
Note: Due to Minimum Advertised Pricing policies (MAP) imposed by some manufacturers, we can't always publish or e-mail our low internet prices. For these items, the shopping cart cannot be used to order product. Please call Toll Free 1-800-394-4653 to order these items. We apologize for this inconvenience.
More information on MAP pricing
If no price is available for the item(s) you are interested in (see above), you may obtain a price quote by calling us Toll Free at 1-800-394-4653, use our online chat feature to chat with one of our golf experts (Mon-Fri: 7a-5p, Sat-Sun: 8a-4p PST), or simply e-mail us with any questions you may have.
Using the Shopping Cart
If the price is available for the item(s) you are interested in, simply add them to your secure shopping cart. You will be shown immediately the status of your cart. Our site uses SSL to ensure you the highest level of security available on the web. It is virtually impossible for anyone to view your credit card number in transit. You can change the quantity of any item or clear your cart at any time, no commitment is made until you check out.
Shipping Information
Most orders are shipped within 24 business hours. Some items, such as select shoes, may take longer as we don't stock them on-site and must transfer them from our other warehouse. We do not ship to PO, APO or FPO boxes. If you place your order between late Friday and Sunday, your order will not be shipped until Monday or Tuesday, depending on order volume over the weekend.
EXPECT ORDERS PLACED OVER THE WEEKEND AND SHIPPED NEXT DAY OR 2nd DAY TO ARRIVE MID-WEEK.
We do not ship on the weekends.
Orders placed over the weekend and shipped FedEx Ground will likely arrive around Thursday for West Coast customers and between Friday and the following Monday for East Coast customers.
New Customers
At checkout, new customers will be asked to supply basic information needed to execute the order such as name, address, e-mail, card number, etc. We only get the minimum information needed to complete the transaction
We do not sell your information to third parties nor do we ask for your favorite golfer or spouse's name. We know you are here to get what you need and get it quickly. Read our complete privacy pledge here.
Returning Customers
If you have purchased from us before, all you need to do is supply your e-mail address and password.
Our system will fill out the rest of the order form for you from our database.

If you forgot your password, simply click on the "Forgot Your Password?" link found on the customer account login page and we'll e-mail you a link to reset your password.
Or, you can request us to e-mail you a new password by contacting our support team.
