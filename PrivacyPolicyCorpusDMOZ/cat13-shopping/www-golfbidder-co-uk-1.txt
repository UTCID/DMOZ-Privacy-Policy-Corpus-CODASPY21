We may also suspend supply of the products if you do not pay. If you do not pay us for the products when you are supposed to (see clause 13.4) we may suspend supply of the products until you have paid us the outstanding amounts.
9.
YOUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT
9.1
You can always end your contract with us. Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:
(a)
If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the product repaired or replaced or a service re-performed or to get some or all of your money back), see clause 12.2;
(b)
If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see clause 9.2;
(c)
If you have just changed your mind about the product, see clause 9.3. You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions (for example, if the items is not in the same condition as you received it) and you will have to pay the costs of return of any goods;
(d)
In all other cases (if we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind), see clause 9.6.
9.2
Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do. If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) to (e) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:
(a)
we have told you about an upcoming change to the product or these terms which you do not agree to (see clause 7.2);
(b)
we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;
(c)
there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;
(d)
we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 1 calendar month or
(e)
you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.
9.3
Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013). For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund.
These rights, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, are explained in more detail in these terms.
9.4
When you don't have the right to change your mind. You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of:
(a)
products sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them; and
(b)
any products which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.
(c)
We reserve the right to reduce the refund if the condition of the item has worsened noticeably
9.5
How long do I have to change my mind? How long you have depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered. You have 14 days after the day you receive the goods, unless:
(i)
Your goods are split into several deliveries over different days. In this case you have until 14 days after the day you receive the last delivery to change your mind about the goods.
(ii)
Your goods are for regular delivery over a set period.
In this case you have until 14 days after the day you receive the first delivery of the goods.
9.6
Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind. Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind (see clause 9.4), you can still end the contract before it is completed. If you want to end the contract in these circumstances, just contact us to let us know. The contract will not end until 1 calendar month after the day on which you contact us. We will refund any advance payment you have made for products which will not be provided to you. For example, if you tell us you want to end the contract on 4 February we will continue to supply the product until 3 March. We will only charge you for supplying the product up to 3 March and will refund any sums you have paid in advance for the supply of the product after 3 March.
10.

10.3
When we will pay the costs of return. We will pay the costs of return:
(a)
if the products are faulty or misdescribed; or
(b)
if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong.

In all other circumstances (including where you are exercising your right to change your mind) you must pay the costs of return.
10.5
What we charge for collection. If you are responsible for the costs of return and we are collecting the product from you, we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection. The costs of collection will be the same as our charges for standard delivery, which is detailed on the website.
10.6
How we will refund you. We will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.
10.7
Deductions from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind. If you are exercising your right to change your mind:
(a)
We may reduce your refund of the price to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.
(b)
The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer delivery of a product within [3-5] days at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.
(c)
Where the product is a service, we may deduct from any refund an amount for the supply of the service for the period for which it was supplied, ending with the time when you told us you had changed your mind. The amount will be in proportion to what has been supplied, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.
10.8
When your refund will be made. We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible.
If you are exercising your right to change your mind then:
(a)
If we have not offered to collect the goods, your refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us. For information about how to return a product to us, see clause 10.2
(b)
In all other cases, your refund will be made within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind
11.

13.
PRICE AND PAYMENT
13.1
Where to find the price for the product. The price of the product (which includes VAT where appropriate) will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your order. We use our best efforts to ensure that the price of the product advised to you is correct. However please see clause 13.3 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the product you order.
13.2
What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. Golfbidder reserves the right to adjust price accordingly before shipping out. We will always contact you first for approval in such circumstances. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product's correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product's correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order.
13.3
When you must pay and how you must pay. We accept payment with both credit and debit cards. You must pay for the products before we dispatch them. We will not charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch the products to you.

14.3
Any quote we provide will be valid for a period of seven days and the price provided is subject to the equipment being received by us in the condition that it is described by you. We therefore reserve the right to revise the quote or retract the quote completely.

14.5
As well as accepting your equipment by post, we can offer to collect the equipment, which we will notify you of in advance but this is subject to an additional collection fee payable by you.
14.6

14.7
In the event that the equipment is not in the condition it is described, we will contact you to try and resolve the matter. This may result in you receiving a revised quote for the items or in exceptional circumstances, for example the equipment being in an unsaleable condition, we may retract the quote and return the items to you at your cost.
14.8
In relation to the supply of your equipment to us, you are responsible for any foreseeable loss and damage caused by you. If you fail to comply with these terms, you are responsible for loss or damage we suffer that is a foreseeable result of your breaking the contract or your failing to use reasonable care and skill. However, you will not be responsible for any unforeseen loss or damage. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and knew it might happen, for example if you discussed it with us during the sales process.
15.
OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU
15.1
We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us.

Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.
15.2

This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products as summarised at clause 12.2 and for defective products under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.

17.2
You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else (except that you can always transfer our guarantee).

17.3

Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
