Ringor's Commitment to Privacy The safeguarding of our customers' personal information is an important part of our business. We do not sell, trade, or disclose that information to other parties in any way, shape or form. We work to protect the security of your information during website transmissions by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information that you input. We work tirelessly to stay current on all web-based security methods. Also, Ringor does not keep your personal credit card information on file. We will request that you provide your credit card information for each order.
For each visitor to our website, Ringor automatically recognizes only your IP address and not your email address. Email addresses are collected from those who purchase products via this website and/or sign up for email subscriptions. These email addresses are for RINGOR's use and customer communication only.
Ringor retains an outside company to distribute email offerings as created and directed by Ringor. This company is performing a service specifically for Ringor and we take the necessary action to ensure that your information is used only to provide Ringor based communications. Ringor allows our email subscribers to "opt-out" of their preferred email subscriptions at any time.
