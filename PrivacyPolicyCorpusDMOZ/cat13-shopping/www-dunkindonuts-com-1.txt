Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU AND DUNKIN’ BRANDS AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE. You hereby agree that any dispute between you and Dunkin’ Brands and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “Dunkin’ Brands”) arising from or relating to (a) your misuse of the DD/BR Online Services, (b) these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof or (c) the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (available at www.adr.org), in effect on the date thereof. If there is a conflict between AAA Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. For purposes of this section, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).
WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.
PRE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Dunkin’ Brands will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Dunkin’ Brands and you must provide such notice by e-mail to customerservice@dunkinbrands.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line.  During such 60-day notice period, we agree to endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.To initiate arbitration, you or Dunkin’ Brands must do the following things:
(1)    Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.
(2)    Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: American Arbitration Associate, Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.
(3)    Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.  If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dunkin’ Brands will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.  If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Dunkin’ Brands for all fees associated with the arbitration that Dunkin’ Brands paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.
AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
NO CLASS ACTIONS. Dunkin’ Brands and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Dunkin’ Brands nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dunkin’ Brands in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND DUNKIN’ BRANDS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing Dunkin’ Brands at customerservice@dunkinbrands.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms and Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.  The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the DD/BR Online Services.
If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced. In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, then such dispute between us arising under the Terms or your misuse of the DD/BR Online Services will be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and governed in accordance with the laws of the state of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law rules.

You are solely responsible for any and all duties, taxes, levies or fees (including any sales, use or withholding taxes) imposed on or in connection with these Terms or the DD/BR Online Services by any authority.
