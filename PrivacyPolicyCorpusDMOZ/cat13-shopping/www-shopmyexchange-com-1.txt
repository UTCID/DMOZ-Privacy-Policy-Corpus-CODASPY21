Privacy Act Statement (Authority, Principal Purpose[s], Routine Use[s], & Disclosure)
Privacy and Security Policy for Exchange Online (General Terms)
The
Army & Air Force Exchange Service (hereinafter referred to as the
Exchange) web site, shopmyexchange.com, is an unofficial Department of
Defense (DoD) site, published and maintained by the Exchange with
non-appropriated funds. The Exchange operates the Exchange Online Store
and facilitates access to Exchange Online Mall shopping web sites on
behalf of all the military exchanges.
For site security and to
ensure that this service remains available to all users, the Exchange
computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic for
identifying unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, and
otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change
information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be
punishable under applicable federal law.
Portions of the
Exchange web site are accessible only to authorized patrons and the
Exchange is required to ensure that only those with authorization can
have access to these portions of the web site. When you log-in your
computer will be asked to accept "cookies". These cookies may be
temporary or persistent (temporary cookies will expire at the end of
your session). We collect e-mail addresses and volunteered information
such as surveys and sweepstakes registration information from visitors
to our site. Our web site also automatically recognizes your internet
service provider. We do not sell or exchange names or any other
information about our online customers with third parties. We are
committed to ensuring your privacy as a customer and will only use this
information to improve your overall shopmyexchange.com, Exchange Online
Store, and Exchange Online Mall shopping experience.
With your
permission, we would like to contact you with news about products,
services and events. To voluntarily sign up to receive our periodic
email newsletter.
If you change your mind and would like to be removed from the email
newsletter list, you can also Unsubscribe on the same page.
In
connection with authorized law enforcement investigations, the Exchange
may be required to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw
data logs are scheduled for destruction in accordance with Exchange
internal guidelines.
If you have any questions or comments about the information presented here, please Contact the Exchange.
What Personal Information About Customers Does the Exchange Gather?
The
information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
continually improve your shopping experience on the Exchange web sites.
Here are the types of information we gather:
Information You Provide Us: Aside from the information available through the official DEERS
database, we receive and store (in many cases just temporarily) any
information you may enter on the Exchange web sites or provide us in
other ways electronically. You can choose not to provide certain
information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of
our features/offers online. We may use the information that you provide
for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future
shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
Automatic Information: We
receive and store certain types of information during some of your
online interactions with us. For example, like most Web sites, we use
session and/or persistent "cookies," and we obtain certain types of
information when your Web browser accesses the Exchange web sites,
advertisements and other content served by us or on our behalf on other
Web sites.
E-mail/Marketing Communications: To help us
make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a
confirmation when you subscribe to our e-mails if your computer supports
such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mails or other mail
from us, please follow the Unsubscribe instructions at the bottom or
back of each of those materials.
Mobile Apps: Using the
Store Locator feature on one of our Exchange mobile apps you can always
find the nearest Exchange store location(s).
Our Exchange mobile app is
capable of using your mobile device's GPS or, if you'd rather, you can
enter a city and zip code to immediately locate the nearest Exchange
store(s) including directions, store name, store address, store phone
number, and number of miles from your designated location.
This
information is not stored or shared.
What Are Cookies (and What Are Your Options)
Cookies
are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's
hard drive in the form of text files through your Web browser to enable
our systems to recognize your browser and in some instances to provide
personalized features/offers online.
As for the difference between
session cookies and persistent cookies:
Session Cookie: A
cookie that is erased when the user closes the Web browser.
The
session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is not retained after
the browser is closed. Session cookies do not collect information from
the user's computer. They typically will store information in the form
of a session identification that does not identify the user.
Session
cookies are also referred to as transient cookies or temporary cookies.
Persistent Cookie: A cookie that is stored on a user's hard drive until it expires
(persistent cookies are set with expiration dates) or until the user
deletes the cookie.
Persistent cookies are used to collect information
about the user, such as Web surfing behavior or user preferences for a
specific Web site.
Persistent cookies are also referred to as permanent
cookies or stored cookies.
The Help and/or
Tools/Options menu(s) on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how
to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data
used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the
add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However,
because cookies may allow you to take advantage of some of our
features/offers online, we recommend that you leave cookies turned on.
What Web Analytics Service is Used (and What Are Your Options)?
Like
many other online retailers, the Exchange web sites use Google
Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ('Google').
Google Analytics uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your
computer, to help the web site analyze how users use the site. The
information generated by the cookie about your use of the web site
(including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google
on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for
the purpose of evaluating your use of the web site, compiling reports on
website activity for website operators and providing other services
relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also
transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by
law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's
behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data
held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the
appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do
this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this web
site. By using this web site, you consent to the processing of data
about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
Due
to user privacy concerns, Google Analytics doesn't report on personally
identifiable information, including a visitor's IP address (IP address
is a unique identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network such
as the Internet, an IP address is written as four numbers each
separated by periods and each number ranges from 0 to 255 [for example,
192.168.0.1]). Instead, Google Analytics provides aggregated data to
help participating web sites make informed business decisions.
What Choices Do You Have?
As
discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even
though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of
various features/offers online.
Again, the Help and/or Tools/Options
menu(s) on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent
your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify
you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser
add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or
visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies may
allow you to take advantage of some of our features/offers online, we
recommend that you leave cookies turned on.
As mentioned above,
if you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please
follow the Unsubscribe instructions at the bottom or back of each of
those materials.
You can add or update certain information (such as in the 'My Account' area of the Exchange Online Store).
Does the Exchange Share the Information We Receive?
Information
about our customers is an important part of our business. We at the
Exchange greatly respect our customers privacy and we do not sell or
exchange names or any other information about our customers with third
parties.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We
work to protect the security of your information during transmission by
using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information
you input.
Making a purchase from the Exchange Online Store
generates an order confirmation e-mail which lists your payment method
(such as MILITARY STAR card, Visa, Discover, etc.) but does not list the
related credit card number or even a partial set of its digits. Of
course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate
credit card company during order processing.
It is important for
you to protect against unauthorized access to your username, password
and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared
computer.
Which Information Can I Access?
We
offer you access to a broad range of information about your account and
your interactions with the Exchange Online for the limited purpose of
viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information (such as inside
the 'My Account' area of the Exchange Online Store).
Are Children Allowed to Use the Exchange web sites?
The
Exchange does sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you
are under 18, you may use the Exchange web sites only with the
involvement of a parent or guardian.
Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions
If
you choose to visit the Exchange web sites, your visit and any dispute
over privacy is subject to this Policy, including limitations on
damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law. If you have
any concern about privacy at the Exchange web sites, please see the
'Customer Service' area of the Exchange Online Store and send us a
thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business
changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy is subject to change at any
time also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our privacy policies,
unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site
frequently to see any updates in our latest version. Unless stated
otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we
have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make,
however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to
make them less protective of customer information collected in the past.
