Honest Price Guarantee
What's the difference between our guarantee and others that claim "Lowest Price Guarantee". Well, we believe that statement is dishonest. Who can claim that they have the lowest prices. We shop our competition and we have several items lower than their prices. It is impossible to shop the entire internet, so to make that claim is impossible. We will match any legitimate offer if you find one lower than our prices. Just send us the web address or magazine ad. Competitor must have item in stock. On occasion, our competitors might sell something below cost, which we will not match, but this is very rare. We do not match price on Livestock or Salt.
Warranty
All warranties are covered by the manufacture. In the unlikely event that you receive a defective product, or becomes defective during it's warranty coverage. Please contact us for instructions on how to proceed. We can usually service the warranty if the product is less then 30 days old. Many of the manufactures prefer to deal directly with the consumer on warranty exchange. We will give you contact information when you call or email. We will provide a web link when ever possible for your convenience.
Returns
To help avoid returns, please be sure to ask questions on any products you are unsure of. We are staffed by qualified saltwater hobbyist and can help you find the best product for your needs. If you need to return an item, you first will need to contact us for an RA (Return Authorization) number. Any return shipped back to us without this RA number will be refused. To qualify for a return, you must meet the follow criteria. 1. Returns must be issued an RA number with in 30 days of invoice date. 2. Product must be unopened and in resalable condition. All original instructions must be included. If your return is not in new condition or missing parts, we will issue a partial credit or possibly refuse the return. 3. Returns must be shipped back fully insured and properly packaged. 4. You must clearly mark the RA number on the outside of the shipping box. Do not ship any product back in it's product box. Always put the product inside a cardboard box fully packed, otherwise the item will not be in resalable condition and you will not receive full credit or possibly refused. Shipping charges are NOT refundable unless the merchandise was shipped in error. Orders can not be canceled after they have been shipped. Refused orders are subjected to an automatic 25% restocking fee plus return freight charge. Orders can not be cancelled or refused due to delay in shipping.
Livestock Guarantee
We offer a "Live on Arrival" guarantee on fish, corals, sand and rock. This does not include shipping cost. Their are some fish and corals that don't qualify for this guarantee, you will always be notified if your items fall into this category. All DOA's must be reported within 12 hours or receipt of shipment. You must be available to receive the items and acclimate them to your system within 1 hour of delivery. If you are not home or plan on acclimating them later that is fine, but that is at your own risk. Many of the animals can go a very long time in transit, but we use the fastest shipping available to preserve the animals health. This guarantee only applies to orders shipping 1-day express.
Usa Shipping/Damage Claims
We ship United Parcel Service. US Postal Service, and Fedex available by special request. UPS is our primary shipper. We automatically email you a UPS Tracking number on all in house orders. Some larger items might be drop shipped which might not have tracking available. US Postal Service is mainly used for PO boxes and some small light packages. We do not recommend USPS for anything over 100 dollars value.
What if it's damaged
From time to time packages are going to show up damaged. This doesn't happen very often but unfortunately is just life in mail order. If this happens, you should contact us immediately and let us know what is damaged in your shipment. You will need to keep all original shipping boxes, packing and damaged item until we contact the shipper. We will file the claim on your behalf. Often the shipping company will want to come back and inspect the package. Once the claim is filed, we will ship you a replacement. NOTE: Livestock shipments do not qualify for damage claims.
International Shipping
We ship UPS and US Postal Service to several countries. We gladly accept international orders and we do not charge extra to fill out custom forms. We mainly use US Postal Service because the cost of shipping is must lower. The US Postal Service is at your own risk though. Although we will insure the package, you have to file a claim with the carrier and often they deny or take a long time. The shipping cost difference is substantial so we think it's worth the risk on most cases, this is completely up to you. We can ship most of our drygoods, some weight and height restrictions apply depending on your country. We can not ship anything considered alive out of the country.
