Rental User Agreement
This Rental User Agreement is considered to be a contract between you and GB Rentals, LLC. By placing an order, you agree to the terms and conditions of this agreement, our privacy policy, our terms of use, and any other documents incorporated into the website. You agree that this User Agreement is legally binding between you and GB Rentals, LLC. GB Rentals, LLC may modify this agreement from time to time. Any modification shall be effective upon posting on the website. You agree to be bound to any changes to this agreement when you use the website or the service after the change is posted.
By placing your rental order with eCampus.com, you agree to use eCampus.com’s online rental returns process and to return the rented merchandise to eCampus.com using the printable, prepaid UPS shipping label that is provided as part of that process. You agree that failing to use eCampus.com’s online rental returns process and/or the provided shipping label may cause delays and additional fees to be assessed. You agree that you are responsible for remembering the rental return date and returning the rental to us within the timeframe specified.
A valid, active credit or debit card which is tied to a financial institution is required for any rental transaction. eCampus.com accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. You hereby acknowledge and agree that eCampus.com may charge you for any lost, stolen, or damaged books associated with your account. eCampus.com will charge an additional amount to your credit or debit card if you choose to buy any rented book at any time during the rental period. By using eCampus.com, you agree to the storing of your credit or debit card information and you also agree to any additional charges specified in this agreement or on this website, including, without limitation, the new list price as indicated on our site at the time of the charge resulting from damage, lost or stolen books, auto-extensions, and/or unreturned books. You agree that we may, at our sole discretion, send your account to a collection agency if you fail to pay all fees due to eCampus.com. You agree not to hold eCampus.com responsible in the event eCampus.com does not credit or debit your credit or debit card for a period of time due to circumstances beyond our control. eCampus.com makes no guarantees regarding the processing time for charges.
You agree to keep your credit card or debit card in good standing during the term of your rental. eCampus.com reserves the right to charge your card a fee of any amount leading up to but not exceeding the new list price as indicated on our site at the time of the charge for a book that is not returned. eCampus.com reserves the right to attempt a re-charge of a declined credit/debit card periodically, at any time and for any number of attempts, to collect amounts outstanding on your account. Additionally, if the primary credit/debit card on file with your account is declined, eCampus.com reserves the right to charge any other credit/debit cards, or other payment sources such as financial aid or buyback credit, that may be associated with your account to satisfy any unpaid late fees. eCampus.com is not responsible for overdraft or other penalties/fees a customer may incur for such charges (or attempted charges). If, after these attempts, the amounts owed are still not paid, then eCampus.com reserves the right to place you into collection status. Collections may be done by eCampus.com or a third party on eCampus.com's behalf.
Please contact customer service if you have any questions.
Returning Your Rental
In connection with your rental order, you will select a rental return date. The rental return date will appear on your order confirmation as well as in the order details displayed in the "My Account" section of the eCampus.com website. By placing your rental order with eCampus.com, you agree to use eCampus.com's online rental returns process and to return the rented merchandise to eCampus.com using the printable, prepaid UPS shipping label that is provided as part of that process. You agree that failing to use eCampus.com's online rental returns process and/or the provided shipping label may result in you not getting credit for your rental return.
You agree that you are responsible for remembering the rental return date and returning the rental to us within the timeframe specified. To avoid additional charges, your return shipments must be scanning within the UPS package tracking system by the rental return date.
A valid, active credit card is required for any rental transaction. eCampus.com accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. eCampus.com will store your credit card information and you acknowledge and agree that eCampus.com may charge you for any lost, stolen, damaged or unreturned rented merchandise. You also agree to allow eCampus.com to charge this card any additional amount if you choose to buy a rented textbook at anytime during the rental period, and for any extension fees or replacement fees associated with your rental. In the case of rental orders partially or fully paid for with a non-credit card payment source, eCampus.com will process an authorization against the credit card provided equal to the amount of rental charges in order to validate the authenticity of the credit card provided.
Once the book is in your possession, you are responsible for its condition. Damage to a rented book is defined as any condition that makes the book unusable as a future rental. Such conditions include any water damage, a broken spine, missing pages, missing or torn covers, excessive highlighting (more than 1/2 of the content), excessive or inappropriate notes or any other such condition that makes the book unsuitable for future use. A fee will be charged to the credit card on file of any customer returning a damaged book and the book will NOT be returned to you. The fee will be assessed at the discretion of eCampus.com and may up to the replacement fee of the book.
