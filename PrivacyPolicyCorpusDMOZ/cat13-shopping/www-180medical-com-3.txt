Statements of 180 Medical’s expectations, sales growth, earnings performance and similar financial and operating measures found in the press releases, and other materials found on this site constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words or phrases such as “should result,” “are expected to,” “we anticipate,” “we estimate” or “we project,” as well as other similar expressions are intended to assist readers in identifying these “forward-looking statements.” Such statements are based on the currently available operating, financial and competitive information as of the date of such statements and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s historical experience and its stated expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in and the overall condition of the U.S. economy, stability of costs and availability of sourcing channels, conditions affecting new store development, the company’s ability to attract, train and retain highly-qualified associates, unanticipated weather conditions, the impact of competition and regulatory and litigation matters. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, as such statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Additional information regarding these and other risks is contained in the company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Thank you for the absolutely wonderful support and service you have provided me as a new customer. I was a bit nervous and apprehensive about my medical condition and how to adopt and embrace the new treatment it required. You were the most thoughtful, articulate and professional in guiding me through the application and answering all my questions. I believe it was the best, most positive customer experience that I have had with a customer support call center. Thanks again.
