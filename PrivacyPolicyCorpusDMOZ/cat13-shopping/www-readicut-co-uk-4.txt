Privacy Policy
At Readicut Crafts Online we take security seriously. We want our customers to feel completely at ease with doing business with us over the Internet.
Your browser will go into secure mode as soon as you click to go into the checkout. You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for the padlock icon at the bottom of your browser screen. Once this padlock is displayed all of your details are encrypted to keep them secure by the very latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology, which is the industry standard security protocol. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone to decode. Readicut Crafts Online will never request information that is excessive for our purpose, and we try, with your help, to keep any information we hold about you up to date and accurate.
You can request, at any time, that we stop using your information and mailing our catalogues to you, by notifying our Customer Care Department on 01162 713759 (calls cost 5p per minute from a BT landline, mobile providers and other networks may vary and may be recorded for training purposes), or at customercare@readicut.co.uk.
We apologise if you continue to receive our catalogues whilst we process your request.
