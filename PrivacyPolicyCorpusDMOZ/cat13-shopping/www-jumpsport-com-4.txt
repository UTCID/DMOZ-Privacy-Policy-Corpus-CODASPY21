What forms of payment do you accept?
In addition to accepting VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards, JumpSport also accepts payments via PayPal, which allows our customers an extra layer of security and expands your payment options to include any credit card or direct account services that PayPal provides. PayPal orders can only be placed online. JumpSport also offers the option to buy with easy monthly payments using Bread® financing.
JumpSport also accepts payment by money order, cashier's check, or personal check. Check and money orders must be placed by calling our Sales department at 1-888-567-5867 before sending your check or money order in. Mailed payments must be received within 10 business days. Please write your order confirmation number on the check or money order and make payable to JumpSport Inc. Personal checks must clear your banking institution before your order will be shipped. Please allow up to 10 days for personal checks to clear. Payments can be received at:
JumpSport, Inc. 1680 Dell Avenue Campbell, CA  95008-6901
Please note: All payments must be received in full before your order will ship. All prices listed are in U.S. dollars. Only payments in U.S. funds will be accepted.
How is my credit card charged?
If you purchased using a credit card or PayPal, the charge on your statement will appear under "JumpSport, Inc." When you place your order, an authorization for the total dollar amount of your order will be reserved on your credit card or PayPal account. This is an authorization only. When your order ships your credit card or PayPal account will then be charged for the actual full dollar amount of your purchase. Depending upon the procedures at your credit card company, you may see both transactions on your account. Please rest assured that you were only billed once for your order.
Do you charge sales tax?
We charge sales tax only on orders shipped to California, Texas, or Missouri addresses, based on the local tax-rate of the address where the order is being shipped. Each purchaser is responsible for determining his or her own sales tax obligation.

Is Bread like a credit card?
No. Bread® provides closed-end installment loans with a fixed APR to help finance your purchase. You pay back the loan in monthly payments and prepay at any time without a penalty. You can reach out to Bread at Support@GetBread.com or 1-844-992-7323 if you have any questions.
