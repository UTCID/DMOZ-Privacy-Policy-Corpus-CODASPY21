"Our clients loved them and it was a great way for us to deliver our messaging! The fortune cookies were a real hit around the office and they wanted to know where they could order more. As a result, we've ordered additional custom fortune cookies to take on sales calls to our other clients."
- Christine Leung, People Magazine
"Your fortune cookies were absolutely perfect for our birthday party! My brother even got a little choked up when he saw the personalized messages inside."
