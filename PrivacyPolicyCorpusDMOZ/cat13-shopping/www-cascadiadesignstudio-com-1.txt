Payment Options - U.S. and APO/FPO Customers
For U.S. customers I accept VISA, MasterCard, Discover or
American Express credit cards, in addition to ATM / Debit cards with a VISA
or MasterCard logo, via my secure, online shopping cart.
Pre-paid or gift cards will not work because my system performs an automatic address verification.
PayPal is also accepted. You do not need a PayPal account to checkout using PayPal.
Optionally, you can pay over time using PayPal Credit, available on orders over $99 to qualified U.S. customers.
Just select PayPal Credit in the PayPal checkout screen.
Click above for details.
All rings are custom made to order, to your specifications. Therefore your card
is charged at the time you submit the order.
Credit cards and shipping addresses- A request to ship to an address that is not the credit card billing address will require additional verification.
To avoid long delays, please contact your card company (look for a toll free
number on the card) and have them add the alternate address as an authorized shipping address.
Credit Card or PayPal information is automatically screened when the order is submitted.
Even if an order receives an "Authorized" status during check-out, Cascadia Design Studio reserves the right to place any order on hold for an additional manual Credit Card verification review.
I will notify you if your order is affected.
To pay by cashier’s check or money order, please print the online order form
and mail with payment to our
studio address. Sorry, I do not accept personal checks or COD orders.
