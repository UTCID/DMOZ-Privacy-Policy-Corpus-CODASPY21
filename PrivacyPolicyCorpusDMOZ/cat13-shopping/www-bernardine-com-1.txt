Privacy Statement
Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry is committed to safeguarding
your privacy online. I will never disclose, sell, rent or lease
any information to any third party without your express permission
unless required to do so by law. Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry does
not collect any personally identifiable information except when
knowingly provided by an individual during the order process. The
following discloses my information gathering and dissemination practices.
Server logs
Like most web sites, Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry keeps
server logs of accesses to the bernardine.com site. These logs are
used  to determine what sections of the site are being accessed
so that I can improve the site.  The server logs that I use
do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your
name or email
address.
Cookies
Cookies are bits of information that are stored on
your computer by your browser. Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry does
not set any cookies. However, links to external pages or other
web sites may or may not set cookies.   If information is collected
by another web site, none of that information is ever requested
by or shared with Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry
Personal information
Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry does not collect personal
information on consumers without their consent. In cases when such
information is required in order to complete a sale, you are prompted
to provide the minimum amount of information necessary.
When you Purchase Items
Personal information, such as your name and address/phone
# is never stored online.
When paying for a purchase by credit card, your name,
billing address, credit card number and expiration date, phone number
and e-mail address are transmitted to PayPal via their secure server.
Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry never shares or sells any of your personal
information with any third party.
In cases where Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry has been
the victim of fraud, information will be shared with the appropriate
law enforcement authorities and legal action will be pursued.
Update List
You may request to be placed on my Update List and be notified
when new jewelry items become available by  providing your
email address.  Submitting your email address for notification
is completely voluntary and is offered as a service to you.
If you choose to provide your email address, I will send periodic
updates, usually three to four times a year.  This information
is never shared with any third party and is only used by
Bernardine Fine Art Jewelry to provide update, sale or preview notices.
Additionally, I use special software to automatically remove duplicate
addresses, so you will never receive more than one notice, unless
you have signed up using more than one address.
If you wish to be removed from this preview list, you may
do so at any time by sending a blank email
with "remove" in the subject line.
Shipping
In the course of shipping your order, your name and shipping address
will be shared with an intermediary such as Federal Express, UPS
or the U. S. postal service.
