Tamarind Books
Tamarind has championed diversity in children’s publishing since 1987, helping to make sure children of all cultures and ethnicities have the chance to see themselves in stories and books. We’re proud to be able to say that Tamarind has joined the Puffin and Ladybird family and the books that were historically published under Tamarind are now part of our wonderful Puffin and Ladybird lists.
Below is a selection of books originally published by Tamarind, along with suggested reading lists that we hope will guide you to some of our most inclusive publishing.
