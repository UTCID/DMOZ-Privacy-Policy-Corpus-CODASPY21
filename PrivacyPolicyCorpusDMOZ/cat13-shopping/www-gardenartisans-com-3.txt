Shipping Policies
Garden Artisans offers varied shipping methods so that we can offer you the best rates possible.  We also consolidate items whenever possible to help achieve the most economical ship rate for you.
USPS often offers the best rate for smaller packages shipping along the East Coast.  Fed Ex and UPS are very competitive but we know many customers have a preference, so we allow you to choose your carrier when possible.
Many of our items do have to ship Motor Freight and require custom shipping quotes.  This option might also be triggered if you add multiple items and reach a 150 lbs cut-off, whether that be actual weight or dimensional weight.  Should this happen, we will send a shipping quote email as soon as possible.  When you receive the email, please follow the links within the email to view and complete your order.  Once your order is completed, we will arrange for fabrication or delivery, whichever is appropriate.  If you do not wish to proceed with the order, please send a quick reply email to let us know, and we will cancel the order.
PLEASE READ BEFORE SIGNING ANY BILL OF LADING
By signing the bill of lading you are telling the trucking company that the shipment has arrived in good order with no damage.  If you cannot confirm this prior to signing, please write on the bill of lading:
“My signature is for acceptance of delivery only.  Unable to confirm without further inspection damage during shipment.”
United States Postal Service packages over one cubic foot, and all Fed Ex and UPS packages ship by dimensional weight.  Dimensional weight is figured by taking your box L x W x H and then dividing that sum by 159.  So even though your planter may weigh only 15 lbs, if it ships in a box that measures 20" x 20" x 20", it will be rated at 50.31 lbs.
Try as we might to offer accurate online shipping rates; often, when we can consolidate items into one box, your rate can be lowered.  Our cart will allow you to place your order in a holding pattern and ask for a custom shipping quote.  Once this is supplied to you, you can then decide whether to complete your order or cancel.
FREE SHIPPING applies only to the Continental United States. We can offer discounted shipping for Alaska and Hawaii on these items--please request shipping quote.
