We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how UniformsAndScrubs.com collects information from all end users of UniformsAndScrubs.com' internet services (the "Services") — those who access some of our Services but do not make a purchase ("Visitors") as well as those who make a purchase ("Customers") — what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning the collection and use of such information. UniformsAndScrubs.com requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Introduction
UniformsAndScrubs.com collects information in different ways from Visitors and customers who access the various parts of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.

What We Do with the Information We Gather
We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

When Visitors or Customers send email inquiries to UniformsAndScrubs.com, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. UniformsAndScrubs.com does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.
From time to time we will use the email addresses in our customer database to inform and provide offers to our visitors and customers about related products and/or specials that may be interesting and useful.  We will never provide this information to any outside party and greatly limit this type of use.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

The information you provide—including credit card information—is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers.  Our cart is a Magento site which is one of the world's largest providers of secure e-commerce solutions (http://www.magentocommerce.com/), and is hosted by AWS, the benchmark of cloud service quality and security.  While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
