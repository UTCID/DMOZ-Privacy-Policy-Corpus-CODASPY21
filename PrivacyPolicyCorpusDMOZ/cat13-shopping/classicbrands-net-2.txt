For any dispute you have with any Classic Brands Party (as defined in Section 11), you agree to first contact Classic Brands and attempt to resolve the dispute with Classic Brands informally. Unless resolved by mutual efforts of you and us, any disputes or claims that may arise out of or in connection with these Terms of Use and for which either party shall seek equitable relief, all differences, disputes or claims arising in connection with these Terms of Use or any transaction or occurrence contemplated hereby shall be finally settled under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association in Denver, Colorado, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with such rules except that no punitive damages may be awarded. It is understood that the decision in such arbitration shall be binding on both parties, that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s fees and that a judgment upon any award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from a court for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to or use of the Site.
