As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves we remain open to supply you with supplies for your creativity & we are adhering to all measures recommended for staff & customer safety.
We are also working with less staff & have a lot of orders to process so ask for your patience for longer than usual processing time which is now approximately 10-12 business days.
Express Post is a postage option not a rush order fee.
Please note that Australia Post is reporting delays with shipping for both domestic & international deliveries.
ORDER PROCESSING TIME - PLEASE READ!
As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves we are thankfully still open & shipping orders with less staff working in compliance with all Victorian Government Stage 4 restrictions.
We are receiving large numbers of orders from customers in lockdown & we ask for your patience & understanding for the longer than usual processing time of approximately 10-12 business days (Not including weekends). If you are unable to wait this length of time please do not order.  Express Post is a postage option not a rush order fee - we are processing orders as quickly as possible in the order they are placed.    Australia Post is experiencing delivery delays affecting particularly International but also Domestic deliveries due to limited flights & increased parcel volumes.  For International deliveries we advise to select the Express Courier International option as this is priortised by Australia Post.
Please note that no changes or additions are possible once you place your order so please select carefully.  We cannot combine orders or rush orders at this time. Thank you for your patience & for supporting our small Australian owned business.  Stay safe & well everyone xxx
Thank you - stay safe & happy xx
