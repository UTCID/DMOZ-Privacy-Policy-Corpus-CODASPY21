12. Policy Shield Company complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Company has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov.
In compliance with Privacy Shield Principles, Company commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Company at: LIST Company, Inc. 106 Prosperity Blvd. Piedmont, SC 29673 privacy@listcompanyinc.com
Company has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Through Company’s participation in Privacy Shield, it is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. Additionally, under certain circumstances, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration for a violation of the privacy principles under the GDPR. To invoke arbitration, you must take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) raise the claimed violation directly with the Company and afford the Company an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the Principles, which is at no cost to you; and (3) raise the issue through the Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to you. This arbitration option may not be invoked if the your same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously settled by the parties. In addition, this option may not be invoked if an EU Data Protection Authority or the Commissioner (1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of the Principles; or (2) has the authority to resolve the claimed violation directly with the organization. A DPA’s/the Commissioner's authority to resolve the same claim against an EU or a Swiss data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this arbitration option against a different legal entity not bound by the DPA/Commissioner's authority. The Privacy Shield requires that the Company has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Company will remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Company proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 13. Notification of Changes Whenever Company changes its Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and other places that we deem appropriate.
