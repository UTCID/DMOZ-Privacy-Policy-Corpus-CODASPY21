information from the message to our order information.

information is no longer required, we will remove all your personally identifying information from our order records
but keep the information that doesn't identify you. We use the anonymized sales data to monitor our sales, product
and service performance.

years since you last placed an order. After that time we will delete your online account. If you'd like us to delete
your account sooner, please contact us to request this.

remain a subscriber. You can opt out of further email newsletters at any time to terminate your subscription.

returned to us as undeliverable. If you'd like us to stop posting you printed catalogues, please contact us to
request this.
We periodically prune addresses from our mailing list, too, and we might remove you from the mailing list if it looks
like no orders are placed matching your catalogue mailing list address.

We will keep feedback comments and reviews indefinitely. We may choose to stop publishing any reviews or remove
specific reviews at any time. We may remove reviews for products that are no longer available. You can also ask us
to remove your feedback or reviews that we have published.

We provide tools to help you manage your preferences and control your data online.
You can also contact us to ask us to correct any inaccurate information, to change your direct marketing preferences,
or to have your personal data erased.

instant-unsubscribe link or button. Using this option immediately stops future mailings being sent to you.

personal data we hold about you.
Your right to object
You can ask us to stop processing your data for the purposes of direct marketing at any time and we will stop as soon
as possible and within 28 days. Normally we will remember your information as ‘suppressed', where we'll keep
enough information to ensure that you do not receive further direct marketing.

of technical information when you access our website. Please contact us to object to this processing.

the appropriate amendments, or explain why we won't, within 28 days.

keep it, we will delete your personal data, or explain why we won't, within 28 days. If you request to have your
data forgotten we will take these steps:
If you have an online account, it will be deleted.
If you have a newsletter subscription, it will be stopped and deleted.
If you have any published feedback comments or reviews, they will be either deleted or anonymized.
If you have an address on our catalogue mailing list, it will be removed.
If you have placed any orders, and if we no longer need your order information for our contractual or legal
obligations, we will remove your personal information leaving only anonymous sales data. If we still are required to
keep your data, we will schedule it to be anonymized as soon as this is no longer the case.
Additional legal rights
These provisions do not restrict or override any legal rights that you have.
