(the “Company”, “we” or “us”). We respect the your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting information collected from you and about you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and share that information. Your use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
1. Collection of Information
a. We collect personally identifiable information when you voluntarily provide it to us.
We collect personally identifiable information from you in several different ways on the Site. Personally identifiable information means information that can reasonably used to identify you personally, such as your name, username(s), birth date, phone number, and email address). We collect such information when you voluntarily provide it to us (such as when you complete an online account registration, order product, subscription form, or comment submission). You can choose not to provide the requested information, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain Site features.
b. We automatically collect information about your browser or device, your use of the Site, and your browsing or search history when you interact with us.
When you access and use the Site, our technology and tools automatically collect and record certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Site (including your IP address, your browser type, the make and model of device used to view the Site, location information, unique device identifiers, and other information relating to your use of the Site, browser or device).
We also use cookies, pixels, web beacons, device or HTML5 local storage and caching, java script and other similar technologies to collect information about your use of and access to the Site, content or advertisements you view, and related to your activities on the Internet. Cookies are small bits of information that may be placed on your computer by web sites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are, unless you or a third-party gives us personally identifiable information, which may then be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Pixels (or pixel tags, web beacons or clear GIFs) are small blocks of code placed on a web page or application that read and place cookies and transmit certain information, such as a browser or device’s IP address, when and how often the pixel was viewed, an identifier associated with the browser or device, or the type of browser being used.
Further, we may work with certain third-party companies, including those integrated with our Site, that use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity across multiple platforms or devices. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these cross-platform or cross-device techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
c. Third-parties may also automatically collect information about you.
Some advertisements or embedded content on the Site are served by third-party advertising companies or third-party content providers. Please note that these companies may also use cookies, pixels or other similar technologies to collect information about you, both on the Site and throughout the Internet. We do not have control over third-party information collection and use.
d. We may build a profile about you based on information you voluntarily provide us, information we automatically collect from you, and information obtained from third-parties.
We may combine information provided by or collected from you in connection with your use of the Site with information provided by you to us in other ways, information we obtain from third-party market researchers, information provided to us via your use of social media platforms, public information or other third-party information sources.
e. Cross Tracking. As noted above, we may use technologies or alternative techniques that obtain information about you, through your web-based activities (including you use of the Site) across multiple devices. As noted above, please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these cross-platform or cross-device techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
