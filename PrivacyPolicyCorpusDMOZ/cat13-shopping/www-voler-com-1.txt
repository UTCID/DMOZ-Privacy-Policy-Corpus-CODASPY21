Care, Sizing, and Fit
Garment Care
Like every kind of equipment, clothing is not made to last forever, but below there are a few useful notes for maintaining and maximizing the life of your cycling garments.
Before the ride
Never use any creams, liquids or products for warming up (winter) or sun protection (summer) under garments made with elastic fibers. These products contain chemicals which lead to quick fiber deterioration for all fabrics made with spandex. Avoid getting any sunscreen under or on your cycling apparel made with elastic based fabrics.
After the ride
After each ride, hang your garments in a well-ventilated environment or wash them immediately. Do not hang the garments in the direct sunlight. Never store damp sweaty clothes in a non-ventilated environment (e.g. plastic bags, sport bag).
Sweat is toxic. On some individuals more than others – body chemistry is different for everyone. If your body has a tendency to sweat a lot, wash or water-rinse the garments after each use to protect the fibers from bacterial attacks which might lead to fabric deterioration.
Wash
Washing a garment can put stress on fabric and seams. Therefore, wash cycling garments separately from other clothes/accessories to prevent friction – especially items with Velcro, webbing, or anything with a rough /abrasive character. Before washing, turn the garments inside out (seams on the outside).
Machine-wash, ideally in a wash bag, on a delicate cycle in lukewarm water (max. 30° C/86° F), and with mild liquid detergent. Do not use scented detergents, Woolite, bleach, softeners, or any kind of laundry additive. Dry garments flat or hanging, but do not tumble dry.
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
Fabric pilling
Fabric pilling (balling up of fibers in an area) does not occur by itself. It always is the result of abrasion – rubbing against something else. For this reason we suggest the following:
Do not use embroidered saddles.
Make sure the Velcro fastener of saddle pockets does not touch your shorts.
Do not wash your shorts or jerseys together with gloves, bags, rain jackets, etc. because of the Velcro straps.
Fabric deterioration
Sweat sitting on synthetic performance fabrics can cause the fabric to degrade. Stretch fabrics, with elastic fibers are especially affected. See above for care instructions.
Chemicals that come in contact with your elastic based cycling fabrics, will cause these elastane yarns to break down. Chemicals from sunscreens and performance lotions (like AMP PR) are a common reason for loss of elasticity and curling.
Sizing Charts
When ordering any garment online, it is important to keep in mind that sizing charts only provide limited guidelines. Every person has unique proportions and fit preferences that should also be considered when making decisions about the best size to order. Unfortunately, since this is information not typically found in standard size charts, it is impossible to guarantee the perfect fit with a size chart alone. Take a look at our Fit Guide article for additional information about jersey fits.
While sizing charts may not guarantee the perfect fit, our FREE RETURN & EXCHANGE policy will help ensure that you end up with the right size, hassle free.
SPECIAL NOTE: All Full Custom and Semi Custom orders are FINAL SALE. No returns or exchanges will be accepted. Sizing samples are available upon request for Full Custom orders by contacting your team or club clothing coordinator, or the customer service department for Full Custom at 800-488-6537. For Custom Express sizing, you can order the same cut jerseys from the Voler Store's regular stock and return them for a full refund minus shipping.
If you are new to cycling, please be aware that cycling apparel is intended to fit tighter than most other athletic apparel.
