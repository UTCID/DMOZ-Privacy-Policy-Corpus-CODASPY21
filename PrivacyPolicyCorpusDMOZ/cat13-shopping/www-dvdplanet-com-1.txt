Pricing and Availability Policy
Guaranteed Lowest Total Price
If you have found an item we currently offer at a competitor’s site, with the same UPC code, at a Total Price*, simply e-mail the URL linking the production
formation to cs@deepdiscount.com with PRICE MATCH in the subject line. This must be done prior to placing the order with us. Price Match requests will include
competitor shipping and handling, as well as state sales tax, if applicable.
We determine the lowest total price of an individual item as follows:
Product Price + Standard Shipping and Handling + Applicable State Sales Tax = Total Price
Rules and restrictions:
We do not price match clubs or membership sites like Costco, auction sites like E-bay or any other online marketplaces.
Price matches will not be honored on items sold at “brick-and-mortar” locations or for sites that offer in store pick up options.
We only price match domestic USA based websites, no international websites will be matched.
Online retailers that do not disclose their contact information, including mailing address and origin of shipment will not be matched.
Price match quantities are limited to one unit per customer.
Price match requests cannot be used in conjunction with any promotional offers or coupons.
Expedited shipping options and international shipping charges will not be matched.
We reserve the right to limit quantities.
You will be notified if any portion of your order must be cancelled.
DeepDiscount.com reserves the right to change or update these policies at any time without notice.

will be charged at the time the product is shipped. If you pay using PayPal, payment will be taken at time of check out.

to arrive as close as possible to the release/available date.
Availability dates are supplied by the manufacturer or distributor of the product and are
subject to change without notice.
If you do not wish to wait for a delay, you may request a cancellation for your order, provided that the item has not
entered the shipping process in our warehouse. If we do not hear from you before we ship the item, we will assume you have agreed to the shipment delay.
