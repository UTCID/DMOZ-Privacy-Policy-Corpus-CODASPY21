What information does Nutritionwholesalers.com collect from customers?
When you order from Nutritionwholesalers.com, we obtain your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number,e-mail address and credit card information. We use this information to ship your order to you and bill your credit card. We obtain your e-mail address and phone number in order to contact you if any questions arise regarding your order. We also collect e-mail addresses and names voluntarily through testimonials, newsletter subscriptions and any contests we may run. This information is solely for our use, including the mailing of our print catalog or sending our VIP Specials newsletter. Customers who wish to unsubscribe to a newsletter or be removed from the mailing list for our print catalog can simply e-mail us with that request at info@nutritionwholesalers.com.
Do you use cookies?
Nutritionwholesalers.com uses a feature of your Internet browser to place a text file (called a "cookie") on your computer. This allows Nutritionwholesalers.com to store your login information and tailor your visit to our site, showing you the content most clearly matches your interests. If you've placed an order with us before, it also "remembers" your important information (name, address, phone number, e-mail address) so you do not have to enter it each time you order. We use your IP address to identify you and your shopping cart anonymously, to track which pages you visit and to gather broad demographic information, such as gender and birth date. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply voluntarily. Cookies can NOT read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. If you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most Internet browsers allow you to reject cookies or choose which cookies to accept. You can still view the Nutritionwholesalers.com web site, but you will NOT be able to use all of the advanced site features available online and you may not be able tosuccessfully use the shopping cart and ordering features of the site. You can still place your order via the phone, fax or mail.
Do You Share Customer Information with Any Other Company?
Other than information used by third parties to ship and process your order, no information is shared with other entities. If you give us your e-mail address to subscribe to one of our newsletters, only Nutritionwholesalers.com will use it.
How do you ensure that information provided on the website is secure?
Our web site has security to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Nutritionwholesalers.com uses technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt any personal information you transmit to us over the Internet. It is encrypted on your computer and then decoded after it reaches our secure server - it cannot be decrypted during transmission over the Internet. We use additional security for credit cards so that your credit card number is never transmitted in its entirety over the Internet. Instead, the card number is split so that some digits are encrypted and transmitted to Nutritionwholesalers.com and the remaining digits are posted separately to a secure server which requires several layers of authentication to access. This ensures that your sensitive credit card information is secure.
