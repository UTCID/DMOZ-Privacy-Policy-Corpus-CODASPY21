Explaining the legal framework
The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:

In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent.
For example, when you tick a box to confirm you wish to enter a competition or that you are over 18yrs old.
When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service.
Contractual obligations
In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.
For example, if you order an item from us for home delivery, we’ll collect your address details to deliver your purchase, and pass them to our courier.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.
For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement.

In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers.
We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand, or develop new products/services.
We may also use your address details to send you direct marketing information by post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you.
