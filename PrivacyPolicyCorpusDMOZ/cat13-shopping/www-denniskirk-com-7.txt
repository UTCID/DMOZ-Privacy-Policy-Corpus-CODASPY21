About Dennis Kirk
Welcome to Dennis Kirk! You’ve found us because the world of Powersports is your passion. You want the gear and parts to
that can make your riding experiences the best that they can be. At Dennis Kirk, we live that passion every day and we
know what it takes to get you everything you want and need.
D ennis Kirk was first created in 1969 as a little snowmobile parts store and mail-order business in the small town of
Rush City, MN. As the years went on, we began to grow and expand into other powersports, including Motorcycles, Dirt
Bikes, and ATV’s as well as snowmobiles. Because of our great selection, competitive prices and excellent customer
service, Dennis Kirk quickly grew to become one of the largest aftermarket parts dealers in the world.
Today, Dennis Kirk is a leader in aftermarket hard parts, accessories and riding gear. No matter what you’re looking
for, you are sure to find what you need. Our long experience in the industry gives us a leg up on our competition. Our
buyers are able to find the parts you need for all of your repairs and upgrades all while keeping our prices extremely
competitive. We also are able to keep the most parts and gear in stock at our fully automated shipping facility, which
means we can ship you your parts extremely fast with Same Day Shipping. You will spend less time waiting and more time
riding.
And though we have grown into a much larger facility, we are still located in the same small town. We operate with a
small town mentality, treating our customers like neighbors and friends, providing you with friendly customer service
and fair prices that you can trust.
We believe you will be able to find everything you need on our website, but you can also talk with a real person.
Whether you’re just more confident ordering from a person or if you have a pertinent technical question, we have
customer service reps and tech support on hand and willing to help you with any of your needs.
