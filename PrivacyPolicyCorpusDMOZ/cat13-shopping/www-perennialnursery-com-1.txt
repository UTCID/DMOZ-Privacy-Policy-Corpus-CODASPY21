Hallson Gardens is now closed:
Thank you for allowing us to help you with your perennial and hosta plants and gardens for the last 25 years.
We have decided to retire to Ireland so the mail order business and nursery are now closed.
If you have any questions or need anything from us you can still reach us at hallsons@perennialnursery.com or visit us on Facebook on our Hallson Gardens Facebook page
Again we really wish to thank you for your support over the years.  Without our amazing customers we never could have made it all possible.
Big hugs from Chris and Brian and may your gardens continue to grow beautifully for years to come.
We will continue to maintain our forums and our perennial reference website, though updates are planned for those soon so at this time they only work on desktop or laptop computers and some tablets.
