CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 65 - NOTICE ON BRASS
Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was initiated in California. Under this act, a list of chemicals that are known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm is published annually. This list contains more than 700 chemicals that can be found in consumer and industrial products or services, in addition to chemicals that are released into the environment.
As part of this California law, businesses are required to provide warnings for products that may contain any listed chemical. As such, the following warning will be included on specific product web pages and included with all orders shipped to the state of California:
WARNING: These products may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.
Products most likely to require Proposition 65 warnings include brass items, finishing products, items made of PVC. The state of California's advice regarding safe handling of most of these products is to wash your hands after handling.
For more information about Proposition 65, please refer to the following website: http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65.html
