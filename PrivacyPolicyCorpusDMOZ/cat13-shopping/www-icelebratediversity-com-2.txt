The term “non-personally identifiable information” means information that you voluntarily provide to us or which we collect electronically, but which does not personally identify you.

PROTECTION OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

LENGTH OF TIME WE KEEP INFORMATION
We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it (for instance, for taxation or insurance purposes, or in case orders may give rise to claims).

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites even if you access those using links from our Sites.
Your use of these third party websites is entirely at your own risk and we recommend that you check the privacy and security policy of each website you visit.
Clicking on a third party link will essentially take you to a third party’s website.
We make no representation or warranty as to the effectiveness, quality, legitimacy or data protections of any third party website.
