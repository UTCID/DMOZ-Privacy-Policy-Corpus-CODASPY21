We take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of Products appearing on our websites are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto our system. Although we aim to keep our websites as up to date as possible, the information, including the descriptions of Products, appearing on our websites at a particular time may not always reflect the position at the time you place your order.
The images of the Products on our site are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer, tablet or mobile phone (your 'Device') will display those colours accurately to reflect the colour of the Products. Your Products may vary slightly from those images. Our websites contain a large number of Products. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products on our websites may be incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the Products you have ordered we will inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price. Prices for our Products may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order that we have confirmed with a Dispatch Confirmation.
The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.
