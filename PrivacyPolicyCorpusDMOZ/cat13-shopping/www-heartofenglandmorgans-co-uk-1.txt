Privacy policy
We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated.
Collection of information
When you are on this web site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with John Worall Exclusives alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.
Use of information
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is so that users may be uniquely identified when they return to the web site. This allows users to login to their account securely and use the facilities available to them.
Loss & misuse of information
Any information we store about you is password protected so that no one has access to this personal information.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
This policy is subject to change so please check back periodically.
