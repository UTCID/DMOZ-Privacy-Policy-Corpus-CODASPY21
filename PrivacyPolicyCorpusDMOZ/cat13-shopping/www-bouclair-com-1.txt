If a parent or guardian discovers that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information, such parent or guardian has the right, upon request, to view the information provided by the child and/or to require that it be deleted from our records. In such a case, we ask that the parent or guardian of the child contact us at the contact information provided in the "Contacting Us" section below for such purpose.

We may also combine these with readily available demographic information in order to enable us to communicate with you, by telephone (including by way of automated dialing answering device), SMS, e-mail, mail or otherwise, about our products, services, surveys, promotions, special offers, and contests.

What are "cookies" and "web-beacons" and how does the company use cookies on the site?
Cookies are small data files that a website stores on your computer's hard drive or in random access memory when you are viewing the website. They keep a record of your preferences, making your subsequent visits to the Site more efficient. In certain cases, this information is only kept during the session and is deleted when you close your browser. In other cases, the information is stored on your hard drive and, upon your next visit to the Site, the cookies are used to recall such information. Cookies may store a variety of information, including a unique user ID that can be used to track the pages of the Site you have visited and the number of times that you view a particular page or other item on the Site, login or registration information, your preferences and your purchase history, where available.
No personal information is transmitted via cookies. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to reveal or discover the identity of the individual user; your acceptance of our cookies will not compromise your anonymity while using the Site.
We use cookies in order to improve the online experience of users of the Site. Your cookies help us keep track of your interests and, if you are a registered customer, your cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to the Site. If you register on the Site, your cookies also help us to monitor and maintain information about your use of the Site. If you have not registered with us, your cookies may be used in order to monitor and maintain non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Site.
The use of cookies is a common practice adopted by most major websites to better serve their clients. Most internet browsers are designed to accept cookies, but they can be easily modified to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to block all cookies. This is done through your browser settings; see your browser's help files for details on how to block cookies, how to know when you have received cookies and how to disable cookies completely. You should note, however, that without cookies, some of the Site's functions will not be available, and you will lose some of the benefits of the Site as, amongst other things, we will not recognize you as a past visitor or a registered user.

Statistical information is not linked to any personal information and cannot identify any individual user of the Site.
"Web beacons", also sometimes called "pixel tags", are small strings of code placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message for the purpose of transferring data.

The ad-serving technology uses non-personal information about your visits to the Site and the sites upon which we advertise to serve our ads to you. In the course of delivering our advertisements, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. The Web beacons used in conjunction with this third-party ad cookie enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the Site and to learn which banner ads bring visitors to the Site.
What is "phishing"?
"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your personal information through e-mail.
How do I exercise my choices about the collection, use and disclosure of my personal information?
We would like your consent to collect, use and share your personal information for the purposes and in the manner described herein, including in order to contact you and provide you with promotional communications. Nonetheless, we want you to know that you have choices and can refuse or withdraw your consent as follows.
You have the choice simply not to submit any personal information to us, however this may limit our ability to serve you as it may prevent you from purchasing items from the Site or participating in our contests. You may also choose only to submit information constituting required fields when making purchases or completing contest entries. In addition, you may choose to limit how we use your personal information by not allowing us to share such information with third parties by e-mailing us at the contact link below.
In the event that you have already consented to the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal information, you may subsequently "opt-out" at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, by contacting our privacy officer as described in the section entitled "Contacting us" below, or by following the "opt-out" instructions provided in the promotional materials sent to you. Our privacy officer will also be able to provide you with more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.
In respect of requests not to receive promotional communications from us and/or other Company Affiliates, please be sure to include your full name, address, telephone number and any e-mail address you used when you signed up or entered a contest on the Site, registered with or made a purchase from us. It may take up to two (2) weeks to process your request, during which period you may continue to receive communications from the Company or Company Affiliates. If you prefer not to receive promotional information from the Company, please follow the unsubscribe instructions set out in the Policy or in the respective privacy policies and/or communications of the Company Affiliates.

You are entitled to request access to, and, if necessary, correct your personal information collected by us. In order to make such a request, please contact our privacy officer in writing (see "Contacting us" below).

How long is my personal information retained?
We will keep your personal information only as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in the Policy, or for a longer period as may be required by applicable law.
How secure is my personal information?
We take great care in trying to maintain the security of the personal information we have collected. We have adopted physical and technological processes and procedures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and to safeguard personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, in light of, among other things, the sensitivity of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. Furthermore, each and every one of the Company's employees, mandatory or agent, must abide by the Policy. Although we do not take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such occurrences.
The Company also strives to offer its customers a secure shopping environment. The Site is secured through SSL encryption technology, through certificates provided by GeoTrust, one of the world's largest digital certificate providers, meaning that all credit card information and other confidential information provided by the customer is encrypted. All encrypted credit card data is stored on servers that are certified PCI Level 1 compliant, the highest level of security certification. This helps protect our customers' information against identity theft, viruses, spyware and other online threats.
While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
Policy changes
If we decide to change the Policy, we will post these changes on the Site so that you can be updated as to what information we gather, how that information may be used and whether (and how) it may be disclosed to any third parties. Following the posting of such changes, you will be bound by such changes unless you advise us in writing that you wish to withdraw your consent (as per the procedure outlined above). You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Policy and any changes thereto.
Privacy rights of California residents
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California customers to ask us for certain information regarding the Company's disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of personally identifiable information to third parties or our affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact our privacy officer in writing (see "Contacting us" section below).
Please include your name and the address to which you would like us to respond, and allow us 30 days to respond to your request.

The site may contain links to other websites that are not operated by The Company. The policy does not apply to the practices of third parties and the company does not assume any responsibility for any such third party practices or for the privacy practices of the websites that it does not operate. By using the site and/or accessing a third party's website from the site, you release the company of any responsibility for the actions, practices and omissions of third parties.

Social plug-ins
The Company has installed on the Site various social media plug-in protocols, such as buttons leading to the Company’s Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter and YouTube pages, and which allow you to share your likes and interests in the Company products, services, and promotions with your friends, followers and contacts. When you click on a social media plug-in protocol link, a link to the Site may appear in the "Likes and Interests" section of your Facebook or other social media website profile. Your friends and contacts will be able to see the link and be led back to the Site if they share your likes and interests, or if they are interested in learning more about our products, services, and promotions. We may also contact you, and those of your friends and contacts who chose to become members or followers of the Company social media website Web pages, with news about the Company so you, your friends, followers and contacts can learn about the Company's products, services and promotions. By using a social media plug-in protocol link, you consent to receiving communications from us for all of these purposes and agree to allow us to use information on your likes and interests in connection with the marketing and promotion of our business. You understand that information about your likes and interests may be shared with your friends, followers and contacts, as well as the broader social-media website community.
