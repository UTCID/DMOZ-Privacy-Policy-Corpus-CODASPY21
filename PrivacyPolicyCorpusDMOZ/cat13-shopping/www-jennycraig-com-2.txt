Check your addresses carefully. Jenny Craig reserves the right to make corrections and to limit refunds and replacements if an address error is made.
Jenny Craig Shipping Policy:
Please read the Shipping Policy Carefully - Shipping frozen food is a delicate process!
We ship on Monday-Friday each week. Orders can arrive between Tuesday-Saturday each week. (Express shipping may apply.)
All orders placed by 1:30PM CST on Monday –Friday may ship the same day.
Time and transit restrictions in certain zip codes prevent us from shipping frozen foods to those areas. You’ll be notified while placing your order if we’re unable to ship specific items to the address you’ve selected.
You will receive a confirmation email with your order number and a link to track your order when your order ships. Please read the email to confirm details (contents, shipping address, etc).
We ship our packages via UPS with shipper’s release, which means you don’t have to be home to sign for your package. Typically, UPS will deliver any time between 7am and 8pm. We guarantee quality of your product up to 1 day after the requested delivery date.
Jenny Craig is not responsible for damage to unclaimed gifts. It is the purchaser’s responsibility to ensure recipients are going to be home on the date of delivery.
Prices are subject to change. Please check our Shipping Policy often for updates.
Orders placed containing non-frozen food items will arrive within 5-7 business days. If the order total is above $100, the order will ship at no charge to the member. If the order is below $100, the member will be charged $15 for shipping. (US Only)
Food purchases are non-returnable and non-refundable once shipped.
To qualify for the standard shipping rates, an order must contain at least 16 frozen items.
If you have a problem with your order, or any of the Jenny Craig food products, please contact Jenny Care at 1-800-536-6922.

Auto-delivery helps you stay on track with a convenient shipment of food straight to your doorstep, so you never run out.
With Auto-Delivery, you will receive free standard shipping to the continental U.S. (up to $29 per order) on orders that contain full planned menu bundles.
