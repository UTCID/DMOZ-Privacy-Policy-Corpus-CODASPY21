Terms and Conditions
We really believe that you will find your purchase from us to be satisfactory. If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with your purchase, please contact us using the information on our Contact Us page.
We stand behind our products fully, and we strive to offer the best customer service possible.
Ordering Instructions
Make your selections from the Shop Online Store page or from the sidebar menu that lists each item we have for sale on our site. Some items have a choice. Pick the options you desire and add them to your cart by clicking the 'Add To Cart' button. Once an item is in the cart, it can be deleted, or you can change the quantity. The shopping cart logo in the header will show you the amount of your order less shipping and taxes as you put items in your cart. When you have finished shopping, it is time to checkout.
During checkout, you will be asked for billing address information. Enter the current billing address for your credit card here. You can also enter a separate shipping address if you desire. Then, enter your credit card information using the name that is on the card. All the information must match before the transaction will be accepted by your credit card issuer. Please enter an email address that you monitor in case we need to contact you about your order.
Company Responsibility
We are committed to protecting and improving the environment. We strive to minimize waste and recycle packaging materials. Where possible, we use packaging that is made from recycled materials. We have an active recycling program in our facility where we take advantage of local recycling initiatives including the recycling of all kinds of paper, glass, plastic bottles, cardboard, electronics, clothing, packaging material, and metal.
Ordering Terms
All orders are subject to acceptance. We accept Visa, Master Card, American Express, and Discover credit cards. Payments for orders must be successfully processed through our credit card merchant account and these transactions are subject to acceptance by our bank. To protect us and to protect you in case your card information is stolen, our shopping cart and merchant bank accounts are set for maximum security.
Calling In Orders
We can take only a limited number of orders over the phone.
Before calling, please keep the following in mind:
It is more secure to place the order online.
If you are calling because you don't want to enter your credit card information into the shopping cart on the website, all we are doing when you call is entering your information into the website on the internet. It is much safer for you to enter your credit card number on your computer or phone rather than reading it out to us. All the information you enter on our site is fully encrypted before being transmitted anywhere.
Most mistakes on orders happen when people read us information over the phone. When entering the information on your own, you can check all the data before submitting the order to us. We're sorry, but we cannot assume responsibility for inaccurate information on orders placed over the phone.
There is nothing to be afraid of in placing an online order. The process involves picking out one or more items, entering the shipping address and any gift message, then entering your name and address and your credit card payment information. The process is the same as placing an order in a catalog but doing so electronically.
Service
We will ship your order according to our shipping policies on our shipping page. See our shipping page for details on hot weather destinations. Our peak shipping periods are the sixteen days before Christmas, the first thirteen days of February, and the weeks before Easter and Mother's Day. During these times, there may be a delay of one or two days before your order can be processed and placed into a shipping channel.
Communicability
If we need to confer with you about your order, we will first email you using the email address from your billing address. If we do not get a response from that, we will call you using the phone number from your billing address. If you give us an email address and phone number that you do not monitor (some people do), we may not be able to contact you.
We cannot assume responsibility for any order beyond these remedies.
Returns
If all or part of your order is returned to us by the shipping company because of an incomplete or invalid shipping address or because the recipient has moved leaving no forwarding address, we will contact you using the email address and phone number provided to us on the billing address form. We will make several attempts to get in touch with you. If we cannot contact you within a reasonable amount of time, we will refund your order. We cannot accept responsibility for orders returned to us beyond these remedies.

We can ship your order but we can offer no assurance whatsoever that your order will be delivered by Christmas.
