Converse Terms Of Use
PLEASE
READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY CONVERSE PLATFORM.
Welcome
to the Converse community!  You are reading these Terms because you are
using a Converse website, digital experience, social media platform, mobile
app, wearable technology, or one of our other products or services, all of
which are part of Converse’s Platform (“Platform”).  You may access the
Platform through a computer, mobile phone, tablet, console, or other
technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”.  Your carrier's normal
rates and fees apply to your Device.
These
Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and Converse and its
affiliates (which we may refer to as “CONVERSE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
regarding your use of the Platform in the United States.
A few important
points:
Our
Terms May Change.  We may update these Terms from time to
time.  If a material change is made, we will post a notice on the
Platform or send you a notification.  Read through any changes, and
if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform.  If you
continue to use our Platform after we notify you of changes, you will be
deemed to have accepted the updated Terms, except to the extent prohibited
by applicable law.
Terms
of Sale.
By making any purchase with us, you also agree to the Terms
of Sale.
Privacy
Policy.  Our
Privacy
Policy describes the collection and use of personal information
on the Platform and applies to your use of the Platform.
1. GROUND
RULES
Eligibility.  You are only
eligible to use the Platform if you are of legal age in your jurisdiction of
residence or if you have consent from your parent or guardian.
Rules
for Registration.
When you register for an account with us, the following rules apply:
Be
True:
Provide accurate and current registration information.
Be
You:
Keep your registration personal.  Do not register for more than one Converse
account, register a Converse account on behalf of someone else, or
transfer your account.
Be
Secure:
Keep your username, password and other login credentials secure and do not
allow anyone else to use your account.
Be
Responsible:
Inform Converse immediately of any unauthorized use of your Converse account.
You are responsible for anything that happens through your Converse account
– with or without your permission. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, CONVERSE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR ACTIVITY THAT
RESULTS FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT.
2.
OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT
Except
for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our Platform -
including text, software, scripts, code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds,
music, videos, applications, interactive features, articles, news stories,
sketches, animations, stickers, general artwork and other content
("Content") - is owned by Converse or others we license Content from,
and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws. Converse reserves
all rights not expressly described in these Terms.
All
trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the Converse name) are
owned, registered and/or licensed by Converse.  You do not acquire a
license or any ownership rights to any trademarks, service marks, or trade
names through your access or use of the Platform or Content.
You
agree not to change or delete any ownership notices from materials
downloaded or printed from the Platform.
To
the extent Converse approves the download or use of Content composed of
copyrights or copyrightable works, Converse grants you a limited,
personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to
access and use such copyrights or copyrightable works solely for their
intended purpose and solely for as long as Converse makes such Content
generally available to the public. You do not acquire any ownership rights
in the Content (including any trademarks or other intellectual property
included in the Content), and all such Content is intended for personal,
non-commercial use.  Converse reserves the right to monitor your use
and to alter or revoke this license or your access to the Content at any
time and for any reason.  Converse reserves the right to take down
any Content in violation of these terms or Converse’s intellectual
property rights.  Converse allowing you this limited use does not
constitute a waiver of any of Converse’s rights to the Content.
Outside
of the specific usage rights granted to you by Converse in connection with
the Platform, you agree not to use, copy, edit, translate, display,
distribute, download, transmit, sell, create derivative works of, or in
any way exploit any Content, including User Content (unless it is your own
User Content that you legally post on the Platform), without Converse’s
prior written consent. Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a
breach of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and may
subject you to criminal or civil charges and penalties.
3.  POSTING
CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM
User
Content License.
Some parts of the Platform allow you to post photos, videos, comments, and
other content, which we refer to as “User Content.”  Converse is not
responsible for User Content others post to the Platform. User Content is owned
by you or whoever created it, but when you post User Content you license it to Converse
as described below:
You
represent that you have the right to post your User Content, and you grant
Converse a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable,
royalty-free, worldwide license to use without notice, compensation, or
acknowledgment to you any of the User Content that you post on or in
connection with the Platform, including your username and handle, image,
and likeness and the likeness of any person who appears or is mentioned in
the User Content, or any of the concepts or ideas contained in the User
Content, for any purpose, including advertising, marketing, or commercial
use, which includes the right to translate, display, reproduce, modify,
create derivative works, sublicense, distribute and assign these rights. Converse
may, in its sole discretion, remove any User Content at any time.
You
understand that deleted User Content may persist in Converse's systems and
on the Platform to the extent your User Content has been publicly posted
or shared with others who have not deleted it, unless you or the relevant
individual request deletion or blocking of personal data in accordance
with applicable law.
Please contact Customer Service for assistance.
License
to Use Comments, Feedback, and Ideas.
You understand that any comments, feedback, or
ideas you send us are provided on a non-confidential basis and you grant to Converse
a perpetual, worldwide license to use all comments, feedback and ideas you may
share with us, without notice, compensation or acknowledgement to you, for any
purposes whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing
and marketing products and services and creating, modifying or improving
products and services.
4.  USER
CODE OF CONDUCT
We’re
excited to have you contribute to the Converse community.  Here are a few
basic rules:
Be
Original.  Only
post User Content to the Platform if you have all permissions and rights
needed to make that User Content available, including from any individuals
who appear or are mentioned in your User Content.
Be Safe.
Do not do
anything that may expose Converse or its users to any type of harm,
including anything that may disrupt, damage, disable, tamper with,
overburden or limit the functionality of the Platform.
Do
not post User Content that contains software viruses, programs or other
computer code, and do not circumvent or modify any Platform software or
security technology.
Do
not use any data mining, robots, scraping or similar data gathering
methods.
Unless
we indicate otherwise, our Platform is a public place.  Do not post
personal information to the Platform - yours or anybody else’s.
Be Personal.
Do not post any
advertising, solicitation or commercial content on the Platform or accept
payment from a third party in exchange for performing commercial activity
on the Platform.
Do
not collect or solicit personal information from other Platform users or
send unsolicited messages.
Do
not use automated technology to interact with the Platform.
Be
Appropriate.
Respect the community and do not post User Content, link to a website, or
do anything that is illegal, misleading, malicious, harassing, inaccurate,
discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate or which violates
any applicable laws. Converse has the right to prescreen, monitor, or
remove User Content for any reason or no reason– but we have no obligation
to do so.
Be
Yourself.  Do
not impersonate any person or organization, including athletes or Converse
employees.
If you are an employee, you agree to include a clear and
conspicuous disclosure of your relationship with Converse.
If you are
receiving a benefit from Converse for posting your User Content, you agree
to clearly disclose the details of the benefit in your User Content.
HAVE
FUN!
5.  COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT
Converse
may terminate the accounts of Platform users found to infringe third-party
copyrights. If you believe that your work has been improperly copied to the
Platform, such that it constitutes infringement, please provide us with the
following information:
(1) name, address, telephone number, email
address and an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of
the person authorized to act on his/her behalf;

content that you claim is infringing is located;
(4) a written statement that you have a good
faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner,
its agent, or the law; and
(5) a statement by you, made under penalty of
perjury (depending on applicable law), that the above information in your
notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on
the copyright owner's behalf.

copyright infringement complaints to:
Legal Department (Copyright)
Converse, Inc.

6.  PARTNERS
ON THE PLATFORM
From
time to time, Converse may link to or partner with third-party websites, social
media platforms, mobile apps, and other products and services (“Third
Parties”).  You may be able to connect with these Third Parties through
the Platform, but this does not mean Converse endorses, monitors, or has any
control over these Third Parties or their activities, which are subject to
separate terms of use and privacy policies.  You should carefully
review any Third Party’s sites, terms of use, and privacy policy. Converse is
not responsible for the content, policies, or activities of Third Parties and
you interact with Third Parties at your own risk.
7.  IMPORTANT
DISCLAIMERS
TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONVERSE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR
LIABLE FOR ANY INJURIES OR DAMAGES YOU MAY SUSTAIN THAT RESULT FROM YOUR USE
OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE FEATURES ON THE PLATFORM.
USER
INTERACTIONS.  To
the extent allowed by applicable law, we are not responsible for your
interactions with other users of the Platform or any damage or harm you may
experience because of these interactions.
Be
responsible and take precautions when interacting with other users
(including users you do not know) on the Platform. Before you meet another
person face-to-face, consider investigating, bringing a friend, choosing
public locations, and letting someone know where you will be.  Converse
is under no obligation to become involved with any user dispute, but may
do so at its own discretion.
WARRANTY
DISCLAIMER.  The
Platform, Content, and the materials and products on this Platform are provided
"AS IS.” We aren’t making any promises of any kind, including about the
Platform’s accuracy, adequacy, usefulness, reliability or otherwise. TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONVERSE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE
FOR ANY USER CONTENT POSTED ON THE PLATFORM.
Converse
does not guarantee that the Platform will be uninterrupted or error-free,
that any defects will be corrected, or that the Platform is free of
viruses or anything else harmful.
To
the fullest extent permitted by law, Converse disclaims all warranties,
express or implied, regarding the Platform, Content, User Content and any
products or services you may obtain or access through the Platform,
including, but not limited to, implied warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
You
are solely responsible for any damage to your Device resulting from
accessing the Platform, to the extent applicable law does not provide
otherwise.
We
hope you enjoy and get the full benefit of the Platform.
8.  TERMINATION
Converse
may terminate or modify any Converse Platform, member program, product or
service at any time without notice.
CONVERSE
may terminate or suspend your account, delete your profile or any of your User
Content, and restrict your use of all or any part of the Platform at any time
and for any reason, without any liability to Converse, subject to applicable
law.
You
understand and agree that some of your User Content, particularly that
which is displayed in an activity feed or in other public places on the
Platform, may continue to appear publicly even after your account is
terminated, subject to your right to have your User Content removed upon
request in accordance with applicable law.
These
Terms remain in effect even after your account is terminated or you have
stopped using the Platform.
9.  INDEMNIFICATION
/ LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
We
want you to enjoy our Platform, but Converse must also protect itself from any
damages you may cause.
Indemnification and RELEASE.  You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless Converse Inc., its affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, licensors and suppliers (the “Converse Parties”) from and
against all claims, losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs,
including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, arising from or relating in any
way to your User Content, your use of Content, your use of the Platform, your
conduct in connection with the Platform or with other Platform users, or any
violation of these Terms of Use, any law or the rights of any third party. You,
for yourself and on behalf of your heirs, estate, insurers, successors and
assigns, hereby fully and forever release and discharge the Converse Parties
from any and all claims or causes of action you may have for damages relating
in any way to your use of the Platform.
LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY.
NONE OF THE CONVERSE PARTIES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR
ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO
USE, THE PLATFORM OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THE
PLATFORM OR THE CONDUCT OF OTHER PLATFORM USERS (WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE), OR
ATTENDANCE AT A CONVERSE EVENT OR CONVERSE PARTNER EVENTS, OR ANY USER CONTENT
OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PLATFORM, EVEN IF CONVERSE
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  YOU ASSUME TOTAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM. YOUR ONLY REMEDY AGAINST CONVERSE
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR ANY
CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE PLATFORM. IF CONVERSE IS FOUND TO BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS WHICH IS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE
PLATFORM OR ANY CONTENT, CONVERSE'S LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED US $100.00.
10.  APP
MARKETPLACES: You
acknowledge that this agreement is between you and Converse only, and not with
the app marketplace where you downloaded a Converse app (e.g. for iOS users,
the App Store operated by Apple Inc. or for Android users, the Google Play
store operated by Google Inc.).
11.  DISPUTES
/ ADDITIONAL TERMS
Choice
of Law/Jurisdiction
You
agree that the Platform, Terms, Privacy Policy and any dispute between you
and Converse shall be governed in all respects by Massachusetts law,
without regard to choice of law provisions.
Except
where prohibited by applicable law, and without limitation to any
statutory rights for consumers, you agree that all disputes, claims and
legal proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the
Platform (including but not limited to the purchase of Converse products)
shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class
action, and exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Suffolk
County, Massachusetts, USA.
You
consent to waive all defenses of “lack of personal jurisdiction” and
“inconvenient forum” with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state
and federal courts of Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
All
claims shall be brought within one (1) year after the claim arises, except
to the extent a longer period is required by applicable law.
Electronic
Communications
If
you consented to receive direct email marketing from Converse, we provide you
with the opportunity to update your information or opt-out of having your
information used for purposes not directly related to placement, processing,
fulfillment, or delivery of a product order or servicing of your product. To
opt-out of marketing communications, you may:
•
Click
on the "Unsubscribe" link contained within the email;
•
If
you have an account with us, change your preferences by going to
"Communications Preferences" and opting out of any email marketing
streams you have opted into that are currently checked, or opting out of all
email marketing streams by clicking "Unsubscribe from all email marketing
communications"; or
•
Contact
Customer Service.
Please
give us up to 10 days for the opt-out request to be processed in our systems.
If you receive marketing communications from one or more of Converse's partners
or affiliates, you must opt out individually from each of those entities from
which you are receiving brand-specific marketing communications.
Right
to Assign, No Waivers, Severability
Converse
may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any
time without notice to you, unless notice to you is required by applicable
law, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these
Terms.
Converse’s
failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of these Terms is not
a waiver of any of these Terms or Converse’s rights. Users should always
assume these Terms apply.
If
any provision in these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of these Terms shall continue to be enforceable.
