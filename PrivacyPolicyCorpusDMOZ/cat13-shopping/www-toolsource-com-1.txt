This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for ToolSource.com. This statement covers the following areas:
Information Collection and Use
Order & Registration
Cookies
Mailings, E-Mail & Newsletters
Log Files
Sharing of Information
Surveys & Contests
Security
Correction/Updating Personal Information
Notification of Changes
If you feel that ToolSource.com is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should contact ToolSource.com by any of the above methods.
Information Collection and Use
ToolSource.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ToolSource.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website.
Order & Registration
We request information from the user on our registration and order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Cookies
In addition, like most other e-commerce Websites, our site uses "cookies," or our unique electronic fingerprint placed temporarily in your Internet browser, to keep track of your stay at our Website. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. The cookie allows our server to remember you and the items you've placed in your shopping cart and therefore enables us to customize our site to your needs. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. The cookie is harmless and does not gather information from your computer or profile your system. It simply allows us to distinguish each individual among the many shoppers that browse our site and expires a specific period of time after your visit.
Mailings, E-Mail & Newsletters
If you supply us with your email address, your postal address or telephone number online you may receive periodic mailings, e-mails or telephone calls from us with information that may be of interest to you regarding new products, services or upcoming specials. If you do not wish to receive e-mails from us, please let us know by sending an email to Remove@ToolSource.com. Include the e-mail address you wish to be removed in separate line in the body of the e-mail. You may also submit your request via mail at the address listed at the top of this page. We will promptly remove your addresses and telephone numbers from our lists.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing of Information
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers (example: 46% of our users identify themselves as Technicians, while 50% identify themselves as Shop Owners, etc.). This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this web site.
Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link Security Information.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers? information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to Service@ToolSource.com.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If a user?s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done at the account information page, or by e-mail to Service@- ToolSource.com or by sending us a letter at our postal address set forth at the beginning of this policy.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If a user wishes us to remove that user's personal data provided to us as the result of such change, this can be done at the account information page or by email to Service@ToolSource.com or by sending us a letter at our postal address set forth at the beginning of this policy.
