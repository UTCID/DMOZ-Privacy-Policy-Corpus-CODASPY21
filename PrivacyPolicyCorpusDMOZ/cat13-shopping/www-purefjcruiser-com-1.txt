Privacy Notice
Privacy Policy
Here at PURE FJ CRUISER, a Pure Auto Parts Inc company,
we understand the importance of maintaining our customers privacy online. We understand that in this time of spam e-mail, and credit card fraud our customers want to know and have the right to know how personal information is handled.
What information is needed from our customers?
When placing an order on our website certain information is needed to processes the order. Your name and billing address associated with the credit card you are using, your credit card information, e-mail address and shipping address.
We may sometimes need more than one address from you.
In most cases we only need one address. But if your product is shipping to a different location than your billing address, we will need both addresses. In order to eliminate credit card fraud we can only process your credit card if your billing information matches the credit card you provide. While we will ship to any location within the continental US, your shipping information does not need to match the billing information.
What happens to your information after we collect it?
The information you provided us is used only to complete your order. Your credit card is processed, the billing address you provided is then matched to protect against fraud. Only your shipping address and product information goes to our shipping department and possibly an off location warehouse. Please be assured that all billing and credit card information is never shared with any third party. It is stored encrypted on our website for your review and updating at any time by logging into your account.
Is my credit card information safe?
Yes. PURE FJ CRUISER uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to encrypt your information. When you click on the "create account" or "checkout" button you will notice the browser change from http:// to https://. This indicates a secure website. You may also see a lock in the bottom right of your browser. Depending on your browser you may also have a box appear stating you are about to view information over a secure connection. Once your credit card information is entered and submitted with your order, the credit card information is destroyed. This is why we ask for your credit card information again if you place several orders with us, we don't store it.
When is my credit card charged?
PURE FJ CRUISER charges your credit card when you submit your order online. If there is a delay in shipping your order, you will be notified by phone or email within 2 business days.
Will my e-mail address be given out to anyone else?
PURE FJ CRUISER does not sell, or give out any personal information including your e-mail address to any third-parties. The information you provide to us, stays with us. PURE FJ CRUISER may compose and send out newsletters on occasion and therefore we will use your e-mail address to keep you informed on new products and specials. If you do not wish to receive our newsletter there is a location registration that allows you to choose your preference for that.
When using PURE FJ CRUISER, you are subject to the terms above. We will keep your information confidential and secure. Please e-mail us with any questions or comments about this policy. Send correspondence to orders@purefjcruiser.com.
