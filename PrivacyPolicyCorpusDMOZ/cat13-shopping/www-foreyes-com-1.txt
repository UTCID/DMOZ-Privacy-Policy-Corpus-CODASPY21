To learn more about our Privacy Practices for our business and our business associates (the “Third Party Contractors”), please read our Notice of Privacy Practices on this Website. This notice describes how we may use and disclose your health information and how you can get access to your information. The Notice of Privacy Practices is available at all optometry offices, optical stores, For Eyes Direct, this Website and by request from the Privacy Officer (found in the Customer Service area of this Website) or written request 3601 SW 160TH AVE.

1. What Information Is Collected Through This Website? From Whom Is It Collected? How Is It Collected?
In the course of providing registered users (each a “User”) with our Services, For Eyes needs to collect and maintain certain information. This Policy answers some questions about what information For Eyes collects, what For Eyes does with it, and how For Eyes protects it.
1.1. Private Information.
When Users register to use our Services, For Eyes collects the following types of information: (i) email addresses (which For Eyes may use from time to time to verify registration, to distribute news or information about For Eyes or our Services, or to communicate with Users regarding service issues, among other purposes); (ii) User First Name; (iii) User Middle Initial (optional); (iv) User Last Name; (v) User Street Address; (vi) User City; (vii) User State; (viii) User Country; (ix) User Zip Code; (x) User Telephone Number; (xi) User Date of Birth; (xii) User Identification Type, Number, Issuer, and Expiration Date (such as a driver’s license); (xiii) User Occupation (optional); (xiv) User Credit Card Type, Number, Expiration Date; (xv) User’s Username; (xvi) User’s Password; and (xvii) User’s optical prescription information.
1.2. Aggregate Information.
Certain information that is not provided directly by anyone is collected by For Eyes regarding Users who browse the For Eyes Website. Aggregate Information includes, but is not limited to, a User’s (i) Internet browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer 5.5); (ii) IP address; (iii) resolution settings; (iv) platform type; and (v) originating URL’s. For Eyes uses Aggregate Information to (a) help diagnose problems with For Eyes’ server(s); (b) measure usage of the For Eyes Website and our Services; (c) administer our Services and the For Eyes Website; (d) inform For Eyes’ partners as to the number of Users who fall into certain demographic categories; (e) provide For Eyes’ partners with information regarding which Users saw and clicked on certain advertisements on the For Eyes Website; or (f) perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior or Users to measure User demographics generally. Aggregate information cannot be used to identify any individual or access any individual’s private information For Eyes collects and uses from this website.
2. Cookies.
For Eyes may use cookies to store a User’s individual preferences and system parameters. Cookies are small electronic data files that For Eyes (or other website providers) can store on a User’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. For Eyes will not store Private Information in a cookie. Cookies may be used on the For Eyes Website, by way of example only and without limitation, to limit the number of times a User would have to enter a password. The use of cookies is standard in the Internet industry and many websites use them. In addition, a User may modify his or her browser’s settings to notify such User whenever a website is going to deposit a cookie on the User’s hard drive. The notification option generally gives the User the opportunity to decide whether to accept or refuse a cookie in each instance.
3. Who Is Collecting The Information?
All Information collected on the For Eyes Website and as part of our Services is collected and maintained primarily by For Eyes. For Eyes’ affiliates or sister companies, or third party contractors involved in the processing of a User’s transaction (such as For Eyes’ payment processing and fulfillment partners), and law enforcement and government agencies may receive and maintain such information as well.
4. Is The Information Shared With Anyone?
For Eyes does not disclose any Private Information about its customers to anyone except as necessary to perform the Service you request and/or as permitted by law. We do not sell or exchange customer lists or customer information for marketing purposes. We collect, use and verify the information we believe necessary to complete authorized transactions. Customer information is utilized to evaluate, process, administer, and enforce the transactions Users request and authorize.
We restrict access to customer’s Private Information to those employees and third-party contractors who need to know the information in the course of providing the transactions Users request and authorize. For Eyes informs third party contractors that they and their business associates are responsible for reasonable and prudent privacy and security safeguards to secure your Private Information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in an effort to secure your Private Information. We afford prospective and former customers the same protections as our existing customers in this regard.
5. How Can Users Access, Change, or Delete Private Information?
Users can change, edit, delete, or update Private Information at any time and from time to time by going to the For Eyes Website, logging in, and clicking on the “My Account” area of the For Eyes Website. If a User desires to close its For Eyes account, the User must follow the account deletion procedure in the Customer Service area of this Website.
6. Can Users Submit “Do Not Track” Requests?
The For Eyes Website does not recognize or respond to “Do Not Track” requests.
7. Links To / From Other Sites.
This Policy applies only to information collected while a User is on the For Eyes Website. The For Eyes Website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by For Eyes. In addition, you may have linked to the For Eyes Website from another site not owned or controlled by For Eyes. Please be aware that For Eyes is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy practices of such other sites.
Be careful of disclosing any of your Private Information when leaving the For Eyes Website. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects Private Information.
8. How Is User Information Protected?/ Security Measures.
For Eyes takes reasonable precautions to protect the information of its Users. When the Services require sensitive User information (including, without limitation, Private Information) the information is encrypted during transmission. For Eyes’ database of User information resides on For Eyes’ servers behind various firewalls to protect against loss, misuse, theft, and unauthorized modification, deletion, or alteration of the information contained in such database. In addition, For Eyes has taken preventive measures designed to restrict access to sensitive data and Private Information, as well as to detect, police, and prohibit certain communications and operations by unauthorized users. Only employees and other third party contractors necessary to perform the Services you request, and only as permitted by law, are granted access to such information. For Eyes makes no claim or warranty as to the security or impenetrability of For Eyes’ system under unusual circumstances or its resilience to future sophisticated attacks.
9. When Might Information Be Disclosed As Permitted or Required by Law?
For Eyes may legally disclose certain Private Information about Users to unrelated parties in special cases when For Eyes has reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a person or persons who may be causing injury to, or interference with, the rights or property of For Eyes, For Eyes Users, or any third party. In addition, For Eyes may legally disclose information about Users to law enforcement agencies, judicial or government authorities, or to other individuals or entities in response to applicable laws, judicial orders, and/or government or law enforcement requests, subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.
10. Information of Minors & Children.
The For Eyes Website does not target children, and For Eyes does not knowingly collect contact information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not email For Eyes, contact the For Eyes Website, attempt to use the Services, submit information to the For Eyes Website, or ask For Eyes to email you. If you are under the age of 18, you should get permission from a parent or guardian before you email For Eyes, contact the For Eyes Website, attempt to use the Services, submit information to the For Eyes Website, or ask For Eyes to email you.
