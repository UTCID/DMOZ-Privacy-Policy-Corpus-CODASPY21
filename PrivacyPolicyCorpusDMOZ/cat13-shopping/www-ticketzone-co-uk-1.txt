In the event of event cancellation, any refunds due and authorised by the Ticket Supplier will be processed by the Company using the same method of payment as employed by the Customer Payment and any such refund will exclude any payment processing fees or handling charges included in the payment made by the Customer. It is the responsibility of the Customer to check whether the event has been postponed or cancelled from the original date and while the Company will endeavour to pro-actively provide information on event changes, it will not be held liable for any loss incurred by the Customer if it fails to provide such information.
If it is reported to the Company that any Tickets sold by Ticket Zone to a Customer have been made available for re-sale by any means other than as noted above, the Company reserves the right to cancel the applicable Tickets without any refund being due to the Customer.
The Company will employ fraud detection measures and, if it suspects the purchase of any Tickets has been completed fraudulently, it reserves the right to withhold Tickets until an investigation has been completed and the Company may cancel the Ticket if the investigation highlights a reasonable risk that fraud has occurred.

The Ticket Supplier reserves the right to make alterations to the advertised arrangements or featured artists, to refuse admission and to request latecomers to await admission until a convenient break.
The Ticket Supplier reserves the right to refuse admission or eject from the venue any person if it believes their presence is likely to cause a nuisance, disturbance or threat to other patrons, the venue or its employees. The Ticket Supplier reserves the right to not admit latecomers whilst a performance is in progress.
Admission is at the Customer's own risk, except in respect of death or personal injury resulting from negligence on the part of the Ticket Supplier.
