22. Term and Termination
22.1 These Terms of Service begin to apply on the effective date of a Purchase Order and cease at the end of the initial subscription term set out in the Purchase Order (the “Initial Subscription Term”). At the end of the Subscription Term, these Terms will automatically renew for period of time equal to the Initial Subscription Term (a “Renewal Term”, and together with the “Initial Subscription Term”, the “Subscription Term”), unless you notify us in writing at least sixty (60) days before the end of the Initial Subscription Term or a Renewal Term of your intention to terminate these Terms of Service. Any such termination will be effective on the last day of the Subscription Term and you will pay for the Services until the end of the Subscription Term, regardless of when you provided notice.
22.2 In the event of a breach of these Terms of Service by either party that remains uncured for thirty (30) days the non-breaching party may immediately terminate these Terms of Service. Any such termination of these Terms of Service will be without prejudice to any other remedies that either party may have against the other party arising out of such breach and will not affect any rights or obligations of either party arising out of these Terms of Service prior to such termination.
22.3 If AlayaCare determines in its sole discretion that it is no longer feasible to support the Services, AlayaCare may terminate these Terms of Service for end of life at any time by providing 180 days written notice to Customer.
22.5 So long as you have paid us all outstanding fees, upon your written request made within thirty (30) days after the termination of these Terms of Service, we will:
deliver to you, as applicable, any Customer Data in our possession or control; or make available to you for download a file of Customer Data in a generally available format, as determined by us, acting reasonably.
After such thirty-(30-)day period, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data and we will, unless legally prohibited, delete or destroy all Customer Data in our systems or otherwise in our possession or under our control. At your written request, an officer of AlayaCare will certify the delivery of and/or deletion or destruction of Customer Data following termination.
23. Assignment
Customer shall not assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the Terms of Service without the written consent of AlayaCare and any assignment made without such consent shall be null and void.
24. No Partnership

25. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Invalidity
Any provision hereof which is contrary to law will not invalidate any other provision thereof. The foregoing and any applicable Purchase Order set forth the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Services supplied hereunder. These Terms of Service shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the province of Quebec and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws which would lead to the application of any other laws. Customer agrees that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or your use of the Services shall be filed and adjudicated only in the federal or provincial courts located in the Province of Québec (District of Montreal), and Customer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and attorns to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of the Terms of Service or your relationship with AlayaCare. The foregoing choice of jurisdiction and venue shall not prevent AlayaCare from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights, enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.

AlayaCare agrees to maintain the following insurance, with the following minimum limits: (a) General Civil Liability insurance with a minimum limit of $5,000,000 CAD per occurrence; and (b) Information Technology Errors and Omissions insurance with a minimum limit of $5,000,000 CAD per claim.
27. Language
The parties confirm that it is their wish that the Terms of Service, as well as any other documents relating to the Terms of Service, including notices, schedules and authorizations have been and shall be drawn up in the English language only. Les signataires confirment leur volonté que les présentes Conditions de service, de même que tous les documents s’y rattachant, y compris tout avis, annexe et autorisation, soient rédigés en anglais seulement.
28. Miscellaneous Provisions
If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect. The section titles in the Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
29. Change Orders Initiated by Customer
Customer's project manager may at any time, without invalidating this Agreement or a Statement of Work that has been accepted by AlayaCare, direct AlayaCare to prepare a draft change order that describes any scope-related changes to the Work Order that Customer deems desirable, including changes to the description of the Project, any functional or technical requirements or acceptance criteria, or any other scope-related additions, deletions or revisions. Upon receipt of those directions, provided they don't materially change the nature of the Project or exceed AlayaCare’s capacity to perform, AlayaCare will promptly prepare and submit to Customer's project manager a draft change order reflecting Customer's requested changes and proposing reasonable adjustments, if any, to the work schedule and delivery dates for each deliverable, the date by which each milestone is to be completed, if applicable, and/or the estimate or fixed price for the Statement of Work, as applicable.
30. Change Orders Initiated by AlayaCare.
If, during the course of completing a project on a fixed price basis, AlayaCare reasonably determines that its costs, or the time necessary to complete the Project, will be significantly greater as a result of (i) any delays on the part of Customer, or (ii) the failure of any of the assumptions and conditions described in the SOW, and if that increase cannot be mitigated through the exercise of reasonable efforts at no significant additional cost to AlayaCare, then AlayaCare may prepare and submit to Customer a draft change order describing Customer's delay or the failed assumption or condition, and proposing reasonable adjustments to any delivery dates for those deliverables and the Services, the date by which each milestone is to be completed, if applicable, and/or the fixed price for that SOW.
31. Expenses.
AlayaCare will bear all of its own costs in completing the Project, including labor, overhead, and supplies, except that if a performances of the Services requires AlayaCare employee (the “Resource”) to be on site at Customer, then, upon AlayaCare’s submission of proper documentation and receipts, AlayaCare may invoice Customer for the Resources' travel-related expenses.
32. Adjustments
AlayaCare reserves the right to monitor and adjust subscription fees based on platform usage.
