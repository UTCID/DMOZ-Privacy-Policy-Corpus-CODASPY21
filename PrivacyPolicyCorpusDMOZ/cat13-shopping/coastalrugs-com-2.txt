Subscriptions
Some parts of the Service may be billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance for future delivery of goods/services.  This is treated the same as a general Purchase, and follows the same guidelines.  Subscriptions are handled on a fixed schedule.  For instance, monthly subscriptions are 'batched' and processed a few days before the end of the month.  Then any shipments made to all subscribers in the following few days.  It is possible to subscribe after the batch date for the month but before the end of the calendar month.  Any perceived delay is adjusted for at the close of the subscription period, as the dates work out for an expedited last cycle.
See our Return Policy

Any judgment or loss by a user of our Site/Service shall be limited to the value of the particular transaction that caused the loss.  That is to say, that any judgment/penalty shall be limited to value of the purchased item or the service's cycle-value, whichever is lower.  User waives all rights to punitive damages, and will hold Coastal Designer Rugs, LLC and its agents blameless for any liability beyond that already noted.  At no time, and under no circumstances shall we be liable for anything beyond that value, including, but not limited to: travel, shipping costs, legal fees, incidental damage, medical expenses, punitive damages.  The Uniform Commercial Code of Connecticut shall be considered on points not covered, and any arbitration handled in the state of Connecticut.
