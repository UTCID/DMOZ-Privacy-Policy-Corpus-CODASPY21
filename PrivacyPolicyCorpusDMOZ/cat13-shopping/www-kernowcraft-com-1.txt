This involves setting up a password for your card for online use. You will probably have heard about this additional security feature from your card issuer, if not you can request information directly from your card issuer.
We would advise you to set up a secure password as it is extra protection when shopping online.
It may also help prevent any potential delays due to additional security checks being needed before processing your order.In House Security ChecksWe take card security very seriously, so for particular orders we may need to run some extra security checks on your billing address before processing your payment. Please ensure that you supply us with the exact billing address, as used by your bank for address verification purposes (this is usually your address exactly as it appears on your bank or credit card statement) as our bank may ask yours to verify this. It is important to be accurate with this information and will avoid any delays on processing your order.
Although these extra checks can cause small delays, our aim is to get your order sent out to you as soon as possible and we can usually complete them in a day or two at the most.Protecting your privacyWe are committed to protecting your privacy and will not pass on or sell your personal information to any third party (except in a few cases where a third party is necessary to assist in the process and despatch of your order). We keep a secure database of your contact details, so we can contact you quickly if there is a query on your order. We try to process your order as quickly as possible and try to avoid any delays, so having your telephone number to contact you if there is a query will mean you still receive your order on time. We will never share your information with other companies without your consent and will not bombard you with junk mail. Your privacy and security are of the utmost importance to us. For more information on privacy and to read our privacy notice click here.
