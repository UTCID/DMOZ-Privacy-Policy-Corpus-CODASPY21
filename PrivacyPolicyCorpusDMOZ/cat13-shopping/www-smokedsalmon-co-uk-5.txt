Inverawe Smokehouse began with just one smokebox. Today we are proud to be one of the biggest mail order companies and one of the most renowned smokehouses in Scotland and holders of the Royal Warrant. Our smokehouse products are famous for their gorgeous smoky, full-bodied flavour.
Our traditional way of wood smoking flies in the face of modern production because we rely on real people taking their time and using age-old skills rather than cutting corners with rows of machines. But we think you'll agree when you taste our hot smoked salmon, or any of our many other smoked foods, that the end result is worth the wait.
Although this way is more time consuming and labour intensive, the end result surpasses all expectations.
Smoking is one of the oldest ways of preserving foods and at Inverawe Smokehouses we continued this ancient art in our traditional smokehouse design.
This method retains the real taste of properly smoked Scottish fish.
