control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
third-party websites. In addition, Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. will not and cannot censor or edit the
content of any third-party site. By using the Website, you expressly relieve Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.
from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website. Accordingly, we
encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy
policy of each other website that you visit.
Important Payment Information: Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. charges a NON-REFUNDABLE listing fee to
Users who choose to list an item or items for sale or exchange on the Website. If you do not wish
to pay a non-refundable listing fee to list an item on the Website, please do not use the Website or
the services.
To view or access all the features of the Website, your web browser may require additional
third-party software, also known as plug-ins, add-ons, extensions, etc. Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. makes
no warranties that this third-party software will be compatible with your computer and specifically
disclaims any liability for direct or consequential damages that arise when you download, install, or
use third-party software to access the content or features of the Website.
3. Website Access
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. hereby grants you permission to use the Website as set forth in these
Terms of Service, conditioned upon: (i) your use of the Website as permitted hereby is solely for
your personal, noncommercial use; (ii) you will not copy or distribute any part of the Website in
any medium without Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.’s prior written authorization; (iii) you will not alter
or modify any part of the Website other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Website for
its intended purpose; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these
Terms of Service.

for the losses of Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. or others due to such unauthorized use.
You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots,"
"spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request
messages to the Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably
produce in the same period by using a conventional web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. grants the operators of public search engines permission to use automated

4. Intellectual Property Rights
The content on the Website, except all User Submissions (as defined below), including without
limitation, the text, software, metatags, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos,

copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and
international conventions. Content on the Website is provided to you AS IS for your information and

prior written consent of the respective owners. Content may feature the product you ordered after it

expressly granted in and to the Website and the Content. You agree not to engage in the use, copying,
or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any use,
copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any
commercial purposes. If you download or print a copy of the Content for personal use, you must retain
all copyright and other proprietary notices contained therein. You agree not to circumvent, disable
or otherwise interfere with security related features of the Website or features that prevent or
restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Website or the Content
therein.
5. User Submissions
The Website may now or in the future permit the submission of photographs or other communications
submitted by you and other users ("User Submissions") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of
such User Submissions. You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are published,
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.
You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or
publishing them. In connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that:
(i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary
rights in and to any and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions
in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written
consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User
Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to
enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these
Terms of Service. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions.
However, by submitting the User Submissions to the Website, you hereby grant Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.
a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable license to use, make, have
made, sell, lease, rent, copy, reproduce, distribute, and prepare derivative works of, display, and
publicly perform the User Submissions in connection with the Website and Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.’s
(and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part
or all of the Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media
channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Website a non-exclusive license to access your User
Submissions through the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of,
display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and
under these Terms of Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or
delete a User Submission from the Website by contacting Dawn Mello at dawn@woodlandmanufacturing.com
and instructing that a particular User Submission is to be removed or deleted.
In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material
that is subject to protection under the copyright laws of the United States or any foreign country,
protected by trade secret, or otherwise subject to third-party proprietary rights, including privacy
and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful
owner to post the material and to grant Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. all of the license rights granted
herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. or any
third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing,
hateful, sexually explicit, or racially or ethnically offensive, or that encourages conduct that
would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or otherwise
be inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; or (v) impersonate another
person. Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation,
or advice expressed therein, and Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. expressly disclaims any and all liability in
connection with User Submissions. Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. does not permit copyright infringing activities
and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. will
remove all Content and User Submissions if properly notified that such Content or User Submission
infringes on another's intellectual property rights pursuant to Section 5(D) below.
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice.
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. will also terminate a User's access to its Website, if they are determined to
be a repeat infringer. Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. will not be obligated to refund any unused portion of
a listing, membership or subscription fee if an account is terminated for repeat copyright infringement.
A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has
had a User Submission removed from the Website more than twice. Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. also reserves
the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms
of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property
law, including, but not limited to, whether a User Submission is defamatory, excessively long, or
otherwise violates these Terms of Service. Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. may remove such User Submissions
and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service
at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
In particular, if you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User
Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple
copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative
list of such works at that site;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of
infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information
reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an
address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained
of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
infringed.
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.’s designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed
infringement is: 2700 E Lanark St, Meridian, ID 83642. See also http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/list/index.html.

of sources, and that Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety,
or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Submissions. You further understand and
acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or
objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies
you have or may have against Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and
hold Woodland Manufacturing, Inc., its Owners/Operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the

6. Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy.
Please do not send unsolicited ideas to Woodland Manufacturing, Inc., including but not limited to ideas
for advertising campaigns, promotions, products, product improvements, processes, materials,
marketing plans, or product names. Neither Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. nor any of its employees accept or
consider unsolicited ideas. This policy is intended to avoid misunderstandings or disputes when
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.’s products, services, or marketing strategies seem similar to unsolicited
ideas that were submitted to Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.
If, despite our request that you not send us your ideas, you still send them, then regardless of
what your submission states, the following terms shall apply to your submission: (1) you agree that
your ideas will automatically become the property of Woodland Manufacturing, Inc., without compensation to
you, and (2) you agree that Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. can use the ideas for any purpose and in any way—even
give them to others.
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. does, however, welcome your feedback regarding many areas of our existing business.
If you want to send us your feedback—and we hope you do—just use our Contact Us
page. Please provide only specific feedback on our existing products or marketing strategies (in other
words, do not include any unsolicited ideas that our policy will not permit us to accept or consider).

and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.
11. Assignment
These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or
assigned by you, but may be assigned by Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. without restriction.
12. General
You agree that: (i) the Website is to be deemed to be based solely in Idaho, USA; and (ii) the Website
is to be deemed a passive website that does not seek to purposefully avail itself of the benefits
and privileges of doing business in any state other than Idaho and thus does not give rise to personal
jurisdiction over Woodland Manufacturing, Inc., either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than
Idaho. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of
Idaho, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. that arises in whole or in part from the Website shall be decided exclusively
by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Ada County, Idaho. These Terms of Service, together
with the Privacy Policy at https://www.woodlandmanufacturing.com/privacy.html and any other legal notices published by
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. concerning the Website. If any provision of these Terms of Service is
deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in
full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further
or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Woodland Manufacturing, Inc.'s failure to assert
any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision.
Woodland Manufacturing, Inc. may amend these Terms of Service at any time. If you wish to be notified of
any changes to these Terms of Service, you must e-mail us at sales@woodlandmanufacturing.com, and if your
e-mail address changes at any time, you are responsible for notifying us of your new address by
sending an e-mail to sales@woodlandmanufacturing.com. If you choose not to be notified of any changes to
these Terms of Service by not complying with the preceding e-mail notification requirements, you
thereby waive your right to notification and agree that you are responsible for reviewing these
Terms of Service each time you visit this Website. In all cases, your use of the Website following
any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised
terms, even if we fail to send you an e-mail notification. YOU AND WOODLAND MANUFACTURING, INC. AGREE THAT
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE WEBSITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER
THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION WILL BE PERMANENTLY WAIVED.
