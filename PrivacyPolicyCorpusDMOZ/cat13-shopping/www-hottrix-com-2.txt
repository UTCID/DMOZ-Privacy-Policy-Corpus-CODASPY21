GENERAL PROVISIONS: WEBSITE CONTENT LIMITATIONS
11. Products, Content and Specifications All features, Content, specifications, products, services, and prices of products and services described or depicted on this Website are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain measurements and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors.

12. Billing and Payment
To the extent you purchase/order any goods and/or services from Company or its Third Party Providers, you agree to pay for all goods and services ordered from Company and/or its Third Party Providers except as set forth in a writing signed by an authorized representative of Company. You will provide Company with valid and updated credit card and contact information (including, but not limited to updated PayPal email address on file) or approved purchase order information and with complete and accurate billing and contact information. If you provide credit card information to Company, you authorize us, or a credit card processor of our choosing, to bill such credit card.
You agree that you are liable for the purchase price if you did not receive any products due to improper or outdated contact information that you supplied to Company, its credit card or payment processor, or Third Party Provider.

If that email address is no longer accessible to you (or it goes into your “Spam” folder), it is your responsibility, because we did deliver the goods to the address provided to us. If you don’t know how to operate, review, or retrieve spam messages and our goods arrived in that location, it is similarly your responsibility as the product was delivered by us.
We may provide self service re-download options where applicable, in case you lost your files, if you provide us with the original email address with which you purchased from us, and if this is an outdated email address, then you are in violation of this paragraph and are still responsible for all charges for the purchase you made, even if you were not able to receive it.
If this does not work, then it is your responsibility to use the contact form which is clearly linked on our web page.
We take no responsibility for this and reserve all rights not to respond, in our sole discretion, or to charge you at our customary rate of $500USD/Hour with a two hour minimum. If you initiate a chargeback due to your breach of the previous provisions, you agree to pay all chargeback and related fees. If Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, permits you to make payment using a method other than pre-paying with a credit card, Company will invoice you at, or within a reasonable period of, the time of the purchase request. All amounts invoiced hereunder shall be due within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, unless stated otherwise on said invoice.
13. Shipping Limitations

GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION
35. This Agreement and the relationship between you and Company shall be will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and controlling U.S. Federal law, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles or choice of law principles thereof. You and Company expressly agree to be subject to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California and Nevada. Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Website shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California and Nevada and to arbitration as stated herein. At the request of Company, any controversy or claim related to this Agreement ("Claim") may be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U. S. Code) (the "Act"). The Act will apply even though this Agreement provides that it is governed by the laws of California. Arbitration proceedings will be determined in accordance with the Act, the rules and procedures for the arbitration of financial services disputes of JAMS/Endispute, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company or any successor thereof ("JAMS"), except that discovery in said arbitration shall be limited in scope to the specifics of liability on the Claim, and any discovery related to damages calculations or any financials shall be withheld until after liability has been decided by the arbitrator(s). In the event of any inconsistency between the JAMS rules and this paragraph, the terms of this paragraph shall control. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and conducted in Los Angeles, California or Las Vegas, NV. All Claims shall be determined by one arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million Dollars, upon the request of Company, the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90) days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90) days of commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to an additional sixty (60) days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced. The arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a Claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph does not limit the right of Company to: (i) exercise self-help remedies, such as but not limited to, setoff; (ii) initiate judicial or non-judicial foreclosure against any real or personal property collateral; (iii) exercise any judicial or power of sale rights, or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies. In the event of any controversy or dispute (whether or not arbitrated), arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, its interpretation, its performance, or the like, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses attributable to the prosecution or defense of that controversy or dispute.
