Bird FoodsBird FoodsOur award-winning super-clean seeds are safer for Britain's birds because uncleaned seed mixes can contain dust, debris and waste husk which are all harmful to birds. We've been feeding the nation's birds since 1937 and all our garden bird diets come with a money-back guarantee and home or office delivery is included on orders over £30 to UK mainland destinations.View All Bird Foods Categories »No Grow Bird SeedSuperClean Bird Seed MixesSunflower Hearts, Black SunflowerFat Balls & SuetPeanutsMealwormsUnique SoftfoodsNiger SeedHedgehog, Squirrel and Badger FoodDomestic BirdsShop our Cage & Aviary RangeShop our Fishing RangeBird FeedersBird FeedersOur feeders come in all shapes and sizes including squirrel proof to stop grey squirrels in their tracks.
