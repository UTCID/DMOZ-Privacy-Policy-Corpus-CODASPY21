California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Opt Out / Do Not Sell My Information Request
Jimmy Beans Wool does not and will not sell your personal information.
Section 999.306.d of the CCPA regulations states:A business is exempt from providing a notice of right to opt-out if:
(1) It does not, and will not, sell personal information collected during the time period during which the notice of right to opt-out is not posted; and
(2) It states in its privacy policy that that it does not and will not sell personal information.
Jimmy Beans Wool does not and will not sell your personal information, therefore, there would be no change in a request to opt-out.
We already do not sell your personal information, so by default, everyone has opted-out of Jimmy Beans Wool selling their personal information.
