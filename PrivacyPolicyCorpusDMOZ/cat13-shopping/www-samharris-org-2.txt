VII. SERVICE USAGE; TERMINATION OF USAGE
If you provide information on the Services, you agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Services. If you provide any information that is false, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete, or the Organization has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is false, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete, the Organization has the right to prohibit any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) by you.
You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes, and that you are responsible for your use of the Services. You agree not to use the Services in any manner that interferes with its normal operation or with any other user’s use and enjoyment of the Services.
You further agree that you will not access the Services by any means except through the interface provided by the Organization for access to the Services. Running or displaying the Services or any information or material displayed on the Services in frames or through similar means on another website or application without the prior written authorization of the Organization is prohibited. Any permitted links to the Services must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
The Organization makes no representation that Materials contained on the Services or products described or offered on the Services are appropriate or available for use in jurisdictions outside the United States, or that this Agreement complies with the laws of any other country. Visitors who use the Services and reside outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. You agree that you will not access the Services from any territory where its contents are illegal, and that you, and not the Organization and its Affiliated Parties, are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
This Agreement is effective unless and until terminated by either you or the Organization. You may terminate this Agreement at any time, provided that you discontinue any further use of the Services. The Organization also may terminate or suspend this Agreement, at any time, without notice, and accordingly deny you access to the Services, for any reason, including without limitation, if in the Organization’s sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement or your use is harmful to the interests of another user or the Organization and its Affiliated Parties. Upon any termination of the Agreement by either you or us, you must destroy all materials downloaded or otherwise obtained from the Services, as well as all copies of such materials, whether made under the Agreement or otherwise.

You agree that the Organization may terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services, without notice, for any conduct that the Organization, in its sole discretion, believes is in violation of this Agreement or any applicable law or is harmful to the interests of another user or the Organization and its Affiliated Parties.
Sections V-XI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
VIII. APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION; DISPUTE RESOLUTION
(a) The Services are controlled and operated by the Organization from within the United States of America. The Organization makes no representations or warranties that the content or materials of the Services are appropriate or lawful in any foreign countries, or that any items or applications offered for sale or download through links on the Services will be available outside the United States. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
(b) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The parties agree that any claim or dispute one party has against the other party arising under or relating to this Agreement (including claims in contract, tort, strict liability, statutory liability, or other claims) that is not resolved under Section VIII (c) of this Agreement must be resolved exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction, federal or state, located in Los Angeles, California, and no other court. Each party agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and to accept service of process from them.
(c)  This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as it is applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard to conflict of law principles.
It is the Organization’s goal that the Services meet your expectations. However, there may be instances when you have a problem or dispute that needs special attention. In those instances, the Organization is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with the Organization, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give the Organization an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes you first sending a written description of your problem or dispute using the following email address:  info@samharris.org.
You then agree to negotiate with the Organization in good faith about your problem or dispute. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after the Organization’s receipt of your written description of it, you agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.
You agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of the Service or this Agreement, shall be final and binding arbitration, except to the extent that you have in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate the Organization’s or any third party patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, in which case you acknowledge that arbitration is not an adequate remedy at law and that injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought by the Organization and/or the applicable third party(ies).  You and we acknowledge that the Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under the Agreement (despite any other choice of law provision).
Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).  For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.  The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Upon your filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. You and we agree to pay our own other fees, costs, and expenses, including those for any attorneys, experts, and witnesses.  An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees.  In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith with Organization as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  Except for claims determined to be frivolous, the Organization agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.  As a limited exception to the agreement to arbitrate, you and we agree that you may take claims to small claims court, if your claims qualify for hearing by such court.
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH REGARD TO ANY PARTICULAR INTERACTION WITH THE SITE OR THE SERVICE, THEN WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SUCH INTERACTION, YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS PART OF THE AGREEMENT BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO info@samharris.org.  Any opt-out received after the thirty (30) day time period will not be valid and you must pursue your claim via arbitration pursuant to these Terms.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.  In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
WE BOTH AGREE THAT, WHETHER ANY CLAIM IS IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND THE ORGANIZATION BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL INVOLVING ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN US.
In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Service or this Agreement be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
IX. SEVERABILITY; INTERPRETATION
If any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions shall not be affected. When used in this Agreement, the term “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
X. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement, including the Privacy Policy and other policies incorporated herein, constitutes the entire and only Agreement between the Organization and each user of the Services with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous Agreements, representations, warranties and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
XI. MISCELLANEOUS
The failure of the Organization and its Affiliated Parties to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such term and shall not be considered a waiver or limit that party’s right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim of cause of action arising from or relating to use of the Services or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or will be forever barred. The “Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability” provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of the Organization and its Affiliated Parties as defined herein, and each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce these provisions directly against you on its own behalf.
XII. DMCA
