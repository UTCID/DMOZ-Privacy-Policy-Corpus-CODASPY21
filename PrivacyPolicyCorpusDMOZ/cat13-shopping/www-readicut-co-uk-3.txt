Terms & Conditions
By placing an order with us you will be deemed to have read, understood and agreed to these terms and conditions. If you are unhappy with any of these, then please contact one of our customer service advisors on 0116 2713759 before placing an order with us.
Terms & Conditions. These terms and conditions and your use of our web site are governed by English law and you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English court. This web site and our terms and conditions have been designed for use within the United Kingdom and under UK law. Whilst we are happy to consider orders from outside the United Kingdom, we give no warranty, express or implied, that the use of this web site or the placing of any order through this web site from outside the UK complies with any applicable non-UK laws or regulations. Accordingly, any products or promotions not permitted under your local law are not offered to you. A Contract between the customer and Readicut for the sale of our products will only exist once an order has been accepted, processed and despatched ( at which point the buyer’s credit card will be charged for the total value of the order despatched), and the goods have been adopted. This does not affect your statutory rights. Prices and availability of goods is subject to change without notice. This means that the price confirmed after placing the order may be different to that charged at delivery. Every effort is made to ensure that this will not happen - please see the section of our web site referring to our returns policy. A delivery charge will be added to your order value, please see the section of the web site referring to delivery. It is a condition of this sale that there is a direct arrangement between you and Royal Mail, or any other carrier which we specify, who will collect the goods for you and deliver them to you where applicable. In accepting your order it is agreed that we will make payment to them on your behalf and act as your agent in this regard. We will take up any complaint with them on your behalf.
Your Right To Cancel. You may normally cancel your order (once accepted by us) for any reason within 7 days of delivery of the products. To do so you must give us written notice (including email) within that 7 day period. If you do cancel the contract within this time any payments made by you will be refunded in full within 30 days. Cancelled items must be returned to us at your cost and must be received by us complete, in perfect condition, unused, and in their original packaging.
Conformity Of Goods. We take every care to ensure that the description and specification of our products are correct at the time of going to press.
