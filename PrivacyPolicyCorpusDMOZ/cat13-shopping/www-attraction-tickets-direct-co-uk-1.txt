Terms and Conditions - AttractionTickets.com
Terms and Conditions - AttractionTickets.com
These Conditions, together with our Privacy Policy and where your order is made via our website, our website terms and conditions of use, together with the specific product conditions detailed on each ticket description and any other written information we brought to your attention before we confirmed your order, form the basis of your contract with ATD Travel Services Ltd trading as AttractionTickets.com (“we” or “us”). Please read them carefully as they set out our respective rights and obligations. In these Conditions references to "you" and "your" include the first named person on the confirmation and all persons on whose behalf an order is made or transferred. References to ‘tickets’ means the experience, excursion, theme park or attraction tickets or vouchers featured on our website at AttractionTickets.com.
Conditions for Ticket Only Bookings
Conditions for Hotel + Ticket Package
Ticket Only Booking Conditions
We are a ticket agent. That means our obligations to you (other than those which are expressly set out in these conditions) are to provide you with a ticket to enable entry/access to the arrangement(s) detailed on your confirmation. Your contract for the supply of experience, excursion, attraction or theme park services is with the supplier of those services and its terms and conditions apply to that contract. Copies of these are available on request.
By making a ticket order, the first named person on the confirmation agrees on behalf of all persons detailed on it that:
He/she has read these terms and conditions and has the authority to and does agree to be bound by them;
He/she consents to our use of information in accordance with our Privacy Policy
He/she is over 18 years of age and where placing an order for tickets with age restrictions declares that he/she and all members of the party are of the appropriate age to purchase those tickets.
Prices and website descriptions
All details and descriptions featured on our website are for guidance only. The images used on our website to illustrate the experiences, particularly those that take place at more than one location, are used as an indication only. Please be aware that the vehicles, craft, machines, animals and settings at each venue may vary. We endeavour to ensure that all the information and prices on our website are accurate. However, occasionally technical errors occur, and we reserve the right to correct prices and other details in such circumstances even after a confirmation email has been sent.
Many of our products have specific supplier conditions that relate only to that individual product. These conditions are clearly detailed on each ticket description and form part of your contract with ATD Travel Services Ltd.
Ticket Validity Dates
Attraction, excursion and activity tickets sold on AttractionTickets.com are either date specific or open-dated. Date specific tickets are only valid for the date/time selected at the time of booking and cannot be used on any other date. Open-dated tickets are valid for a period of time (normally a certain number of months from the date of purchase or valid for the calendar year purchased) and can be first activated at any point during this period. Open-dated tickets then expired after a specific number of days from first use. The validity of every ticket sold on this website is detailed on each ticket description page and forms part of your contract with ATD Travel Services Ltd.
Ticket validity dates are not related in any way to your holiday departure date. We ask for your holiday departure date at checkout to simply ensure balance payments are processed correctly and tickets can be received by you before you leave on holiday.
Price policy
All prices are quoted in £s sterling. The prices quoted, shown on our website, and in supplementary promotional material, apply at the time of publication, however, they are subject to change without notice. The price of your tickets will be confirmed on order. Unless a technical error has occurred (which we will deal with promptly), once you have paid for your tickets in full or paid a non-refundable deposit, the price of your tickets is confirmed and will not increase.
Price Match
We believe that the prices of attraction tickets on our website represent excellent value. Consequently, if you book and pay in full via AttractionTickets.com and subsequently find the same attraction tickets cheaper elsewhere with a fellow ABTA member, we will pay you the difference in price. Likewise, if you are yet to order and find the exact same tickets cheaper on another ABTA member site, we will match the price! If you find the same ticket cheaper after confirming your order with us, we will refund the difference to you.
The above promises are subject to:
Your notification in writing to us of the cheaper price, within 7 days of your receipt of our confirmation of your order.
Our validation (at our absolute discretion) that the cheaper price published elsewhere on another ABTA member site, is in respect of tickets that are exactly the same, on the same departure dates, departure points and for the same duration and be fulfilled in the same manner (eg voucher/hard copy tickets) as your confirmed order with us.
The ticket being a real ticket, not a voucher or “e-ticket” (in cases where we provide real tickets).
The ticket price being based on a single ticket (this price guarantee excludes group discounts).
Our reserved right to withdraw any added value (eg payment on deposit or free gift) that we would normally send with the tickets.
Special discount offers, or promotional ticket prices are excluded from this guarantee.
Tickets must be new and in stock for purchase on that same day and the price we match must be available for purchase on that day.
The cheaper price must be inclusive of all additional charges, fees and delivery costs.
The cheaper price must be in pounds sterling and be available to purchase at the time you notify us of it.
The Price match guarantee will not apply in conjunction with our WIN/WIN deposit offer
For any price matched ticket, we will supply the equivalent STANDARD ticket (not FLEX or FLEX-PLUS) where applicable.
Payment and Confirmation
When ordering tickets online, full payment or a non-refundable deposit is required at the time of order and will be taken when you click the ‘authorise’ button. Upon receipt of full payment or a non-refundable deposit, we will issue a confirmation of ticket order via email.
For Orlando customers travelling 42 days or more before the date the tickets are due to be activated, an optional non-refundable deposit can be paid at the time of order. Once you pay your deposit the price of the tickets is locked and will remain unchanged if the prices on our website increase or decrease. Where you have paid a non-refundable deposit, the balance of the cost of your tickets is due not less than 42 days prior to scheduled departure. It is your responsibility to ensure the balance is paid in full and on time. If we do not receive this balance in full and on time, we reserve the right to treat your ticket order as cancelled by you. If you are ordering within 42 days of departure, full payment is due at time of order.
There is no charge when paying by Visa, AMEX (phone orders only), Mastercard or debit cards. Regrettably we cannot process Diners Cards.
Subject to availability, when we issue you with your ticket order confirmation email, a contract will exist: i) between you and us for the provision of tickets or vouchers to enable entrance/access the experience, excursion, attraction or theme park detailed on those tickets and ii) between you and the supplier of the experience, excursion attraction or theme park for the supply of the service in question. If there has been a technical error, we reserve the right to amend your booking within 7 days of the confirmation being sent.
It is your responsibility to check your ticket order confirmation email, and to urgently advise us if there are any errors or omissions. Your rights may be affected in relation to any matter arising as a result of such error or omission if you fail to do so. Alteration or cancellation of the order by you once a confirmation of ticket order has been issued will be subject to the charges outlined in the applicable supplier’s terms and conditions and in line with the information details on the page from which you made your booking as well as on your confirmation of order.
Please note that customers outside of the UK may be asked for additional proof of address before tickets can be sent.
Insurance
It is a condition of our agreement that you are covered by adequate travel insurance for the trip on which you use your tickets. Such insurance as a minimum must cover your losses sustained as a result of cancellation, medical issues, and repatriation in the event of accident or illness. If you choose to travel without adequate insurance cover, we will not be liable for any of your losses howsoever arising, in respect of which insurance cover would otherwise have been available.
Your tickets
Following receipt of your full payment, and the issue of our ticket order confirmation, you will usually receive your tickets within 7 days. However, we reserve the right to despatch tickets up to 14 days prior to the date that your tickets are due to commence. In these circumstances, we will keep you updated as to when you might receive them.
Overseas orders (non-UK and Ireland) are subject to a standard shipping charge of £25. Upon full payment, you will be notified of your tickets being despatched and you can expect them to arrive in 5-7 days.
We send real tickets for theme park orders unless otherwise stated on the relevant product page. They have a high monetary value. You should treat them as you would your cash or passports and keep them safe at all times. Please note that where we have arranged for you to collect your tickets at the gate of the attraction, the named lead passenger will be asked to provide photo ID to take receipt of your tickets.
It is your responsibility to provide a correct and suitable delivery address. We will not re-issue or replace tickets sent to an incorrect address supplied by you.
You should thoroughly check the contents of your package immediately upon on receipt and advise us of any problems. We will not be liable for any tickets that you claim were not provided after this time
After your tickets have been delivered to you, they are your responsibility and we will not issue replacements should they be lost, damaged or stolen unless those tickets are bought as FLEX of FLEX-PLUS options as detailed below.
Standard, Flex and Flex-Plus
If you purchase a FLEX or FLEX-PLUS ticket the terms and conditions of that protection apply, and these are;
FLEX or FLEX-PLUS is only available on ‘core’ Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Parks Orlando tickets.
We define ‘Core’ tickets as multi-day, open-dated tickets for the above attractions and excludes dated special event tickets (i.e. Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party / Very Merry Christmas Party, Disney VIP Tour, Discovery Cove)
SeaWorld Parks Orlando tickets that are supplied as part of a Discovery Cove package are excluded from FLEX / FLEX-PLUS ticket protection
The conditions and benefits of a FLEX or FLEX-PLUS ticket apply only to the specific tickets purchased at that protection level. Buying a FLEX or FLEX-PLUS ticket does not protect your entire order with those same conditions. Any tickets on the same order that are booked as a STANDARD ticket or where we do not offer the protection levels are subject to our general Terms and Conditions found here within.
Once FLEX-PLUS tickets are ordered those tickets cannot be downgraded to FLEX or STANDARD options at any time.
Equally, a STANDARD or FLEX ticket cannot be upgraded to FLEX PLUS at any time after a order is confirmed.
Orders can be changed from STANDARD to FLEX or vice versa (limited to one change) at any time up to the order being fully paid, at which point all tickets are locked and bound to the relevant terms.
If you cancel a FLEX-PLUS ticket you will avoid time-based cancellation fees (see below for details). The refund paid on your ticket(s) will be the cost of the equivalent STANDARD ticket (your ticket cost minus any protection excess) at the time of order. Our usual cancelation fees apply as normal for STANDARD and FLEX tickets.
If you have FLEX or FLEX-PLUS tickets and you wish to delay travel by up to a year, there will be no admin fee for this change but any difference in ticket costs will be charged. These will be ticketed at the same protection level as booked originally – be it FLEX or FLEX-PLUS. Delayed travel to STANDARD tickets will incur a £25 (per order) admin fee.
Should you have a mix of STANDARD, FLEX and FLEX-PLUS on your order, only the number of tickets bought at each protection level are covered by those terms. (For example, should you have 2 x STANDARD and 2 x FLEX of a single ticket type and lose all 4, we will only be able to replace the two FLEX tickets)
For FLEX or FLEX-PLUS tickets, we will arrange for replacement of lost, damaged or stolen tickets:
To be posted to you within 3 days if this occurs in the UK.
To be picked up at guest services at the relevant attraction in the USA If this occurs while on holiday. These can be collected by the named lead passenger who will need Photo ID for collection.
We will also provide you with a document with an emergency helpline number.
If you do not activate some of your tickets
If you choose to cover any of your ‘core’ theme park tickets with FLEX-PLUS protection and do not activate them while on your holiday, you can receive a full refund for those tickets upon your return to the UK
A non-activated ticket is a ticket that has not been used at any point to gain entry to the intended park or parks
This is not limited to number of available days or parks used. A ticket used for any period to gain access to any available attraction will be classed as fully activated and not available for refund.
In order to receive your refund, your tickets must be returned to us prior to the expiry date of said ticket. These are;
For Walt Disney World – 31st January following the year for which the ticket was valid
For Universal Orlando – 31st January following the year for which the ticket was valid. Halloween Horror Nights tickets must be returned within 28 days of the end of that year’s season.
For SeaWorld Parks – within 21-days of the expiry from the individual ticket conditions (printed on the reverse of your ticket in US date format)
If you change or cancel your booking
We will try to assist in the event that you need to change or cancel your confirmed ticket order, but we cannot guarantee that the ticket terms or supplier will allow such requests. Amendments and cancellations can only be accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ticket and may be subject to charges.
If you need to make a change to or cancel your confirmed ticket order, and the terms of the tickets you have booked allow, you should contact us in writing via email to customerservices@attractiontickets.com. Any cancellation or amendment request will take effect on the day we receive the tickets back from you. We recommend that you use a secure, signed for delivery service. Proof of posting is not proof of receipt.
If you cancel your order, the cancellation charges detailed on the product page from which you made your booking will be payable by you. Any refund due to you will only be paid once any tickets have been returned to us (if you already have them) and have not been defaced or damaged in any way. The cancellation charges you will be required to pay will be calculated from the date we receive written notification of your cancellation.
If you need to make a change to your tickets once you have received them (for example upgrading the number of days on your Disney tickets from 7 to 14 or amending the date of usage), then you should contact us by telephone as soon as possible. You should also confirm your request by giving us notice in writing via email to customerservices@attractiontickets.com.
All ticket changes (excluding tickets purchased with Flex or Flex-Plus protection) are subject to an administrative charge of £25 plus the difference between the selling price of the two tickets in question. You should be aware that these costs could increase the closer to the date that tickets are to become active so you should contact us as soon as possible. If ticket prices are cheaper when you amend your order, the original price you paid will be used.
Changes and cancellations by us or the supplier
On occasion it may be necessary for the supplier to amend certain tickets or to cancel them. We reserve the right to amend or cancel tickets on behalf of a ticket supplier at any time. If a material change to, or cancellation of your theme park or other attraction ticket becomes necessary, (for example where you have made an order via an old/ cached page of our website) we will tell you as soon as possible. If there is time to do so before the date on which the ticket is due to be redeemed, we will replace it with a ticket to the same value as your original order or if there isn’t sufficient time to do so, give you a full refund.
As your contract for the supply of experience, excursion, theme park or attraction services is with the supplier, we will have no liability in relation to any changes to or cancellations to these services other than to inform you as soon as reasonably possible of any changes or cancellations that may affect you that are notified to us by the supplier in question. We will also liaise between you and the supplier in relation to any alternative tickets or services they may offer.
The above sets out the maximum extent of our liability for changes and cancellations and we regret we cannot meet any expenses or losses you may incur as a result of any change or cancellation.
Very rarely, after your tickets have been activated, the supplier of your service may be forced by Force Majeure to change or cancel part or all of your tickets or close a park, attraction or experience. If this does happen then we regret that neither we nor your supplier(s) will be able to provide any refunds, pay you any compensation or meet any losses or expenses you incur as a result.
Force Majeure
Except where otherwise expressly stated in these order conditions we will not be liable or pay you compensation if our contractual obligations to you are affected by any event which we or the supplier(s) of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due care, foresee or avoid. These events can include but are not limited to war, threat of war, civil strife, terrorist activity and its consequences or the threat of such activity, riot, pandemics, epidemics, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, chemical or biological disaster, adverse weather conditions, the act of any government or other national or local authority and all similar events outside our or the supplier(s) concerned’s control. Advice from the Foreign Office to avoid or leave a particular country may constitute Force Majeure as may any consequences of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, or any consequences of it so leaving.
Liability
Our only obligations to you (other than those which are expressly set out in these conditions) are to take your ticket order in accordance with your instructions and to provide you with a ticket or voucher to enable entry/access to the arrangement(s) in question. Your contract for the supply of services is with the supplier and its terms and conditions apply to that contract. Copies of these are available on request. tickets. We accept no responsibility for the supply of the services.
We will not be responsible or pay you compensation for any injury, illness, death, loss, damage, expense, cost or other claim of any description if it results from:-
i. the act(s) and/or omission(s) of the person(s) affected;
ii. the act(s) and/or omission(s) of a third party unconnected with the provision of the services contracted for and which were unforeseeable or unavoidable;
or
iii. unusual or unforeseeable circumstances beyond ours or our supplier(s) control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised;
or
iv. an event which either ourselves or suppliers could not, even with all due care, have foreseen or forestalled.
We will not be responsible or pay you compensation:-
i. for services or facilities which do not form part of our agreement or where they are not advertised by us.
ii. for any damage, loss or expense or other sum(s) of any description which on the basis of the information given to us by you concerning your tickets prior to them being confirmed, we could not have foreseen you would suffer or incur if we breached our contract with you; or that relate to any business.
Any compensation that is payable will be calculated taking into consideration all relevant factors for example (but not limited to):-
i. whether or not you have followed the complaints procedure as described in these conditions. It is a condition of our acceptance of liability under this clause that you notify any claim to ourselves and our supplier(s) strictly in accordance with the complaints procedure set out in these conditions.
ii. the extent to which ours or our employees’ or suppliers’ negligence affected the overall enjoyment associated with your tickets.
iii. when making any payment, we are entitled to deduct any money which you have received or are entitled to receive from any supplier for the complaint or claim in question.
(Please also note that where any payment is made, the person(s) receiving it (and their parent or guardian if under 18 years) must also assign to ourselves or our insurers any rights they may have to pursue any third party and must provide ourselves and our insurers with all assistance we may reasonably require.)
The maximum amount we will have to pay you in respect of all claims which don’t involve injury, illness or death these claims is twice the price paid by or on behalf of the person(s) affected in total. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you or your party has not received any benefit at all from your tickets.
Your behaviour
If in our opinion or in the opinion of any person in authority, your behaviour is causing or is likely to cause distress, danger, damage or annoyance to any third party or property, or to cause a delay or diversion to transportation, we or the supplier reserve the right to terminate your tickets immediately. In the event of such termination our responsibilities to you will cease and you will be required to leave the applicable service immediately. We will have no further obligations to you and will not meet any expenses, costs or losses incurred as a result. You may also be required to pay for loss and/or damage caused by your actions directly to the applicable supplier prior to departure from the service. If you fail to do so, you will be responsible for meeting any claims and costs subsequently made against us as a result.
If you have a complaint or problem
Because the contract for the supply of all services is between you and the supplier, any queries or concerns about those services should be addressed to them. If you have a problem whilst away, this must be reported to the supplier or their agent immediately. If you wish to complain when you return home, write to the supplier. You will see their name and contact details in any confirmation documents we send you.
Any complaints or problems relating to the order and supply of any ticket must be reported to us in writing immediately. Please address all emails to customerservices@attractiontickets.com. We will acknowledge all complaints within 3 working days. Sometimes we need to investigate issues raised with 3rd party suppliers which may take time to do so. We do however aim to respond in full within 14 days. If for any reason we are unable to respond within that time, we will endeavour to notify you as soon as possible.
If you fail to follow these procedures there will be less opportunity for us and/ or the supplier to investigate and rectify your complaint. The amount of compensation you may be entitled to may therefore be reduced or extinguished as a result.

Disabled Clients
We must be advised at the time of order of any disability and special requirements so that we may notify the supplier concerned. Special facilities can be requested but may not be guaranteed. Acting reasonably, if suppliers are unable to properly accommodate the needs of the person(s) concerned, we may refuse to confirm your ticket order or if you did not give us full details at the time of order, cancel it and impose applicable cancellation charges when we or they become aware of these details.
Special Requests
If you have any special request, you must advise us in writing at the time of order. Although we will endeavour to pass any reasonable requests on to the relevant supplier, we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met unless any supplier has specifically confirmed this. For your own protection, you should obtain confirmation in writing from us that your request will be complied with (where it is possible for us to give this) if your request is important to you. Confirmation that a special request has been noted or passed on to the supplier or the inclusion of the special request on your confirmation letter or any other documentation is not confirmation that the request will be met. Unless and until specifically confirmed, all special requests are subject to availability.
Special Offers
Please note offers are subject to availability and may be withdrawn by us or the supplier as applicable without notice.
Conditions of Suppliers
The services which make up your order are provided by independent suppliers. Those suppliers provide these services in accordance with their own terms and conditions which will form part of your contract with us. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier's liability to you, usually in accordance with applicable International Conventions. Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are available on request from ourselves or the supplier concerned.
Covid-19: Limitation of liability
We both acknowledge the ongoing COVID-19 global crisis and accept our obligations to comply with any official guidance from governments or local authorities, both in the UK and whilst on holiday.
Please note that we will have no liability for any refunds, compensation, costs, expenses or other losses of any kind incurred by you, in the following circumstances:
• If you, or anyone in your booking party, test positive for Covid-19 and have to quarantine for a period of time, or are notified or otherwise become aware that you have, or suspect you may have, come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 (or where they otherwise suspect they may have Covid-19) and have to self-isolate for a period of time. If this happens within 14 days of your departure date, you must contact us as you may no longer be able to travel.
• You fail any tests, checks or other measures imposed by a supplier, airline, port or airport, border control authority or other government body or local authority or fail to submit for testing or assessment when requested to do so, and as such you are denied entry to board the flight, entry to the destination, access to the services or you are otherwise unable to proceed with the holiday, or that portion of the holiday.
An inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. By visiting an attraction or joining a tour or activity, you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19.
You also acknowledge that the suppliers providing your services will need to comply with national and/or local guidance and requirements relating to Covid-19, and have implemented certain measures as a result. This will likely include specific requirements regarding personal protective equipment, such as use of face-masks by staff (and you may be required to wear a face-mask as well), social distancing, maximum number restrictions on the use of certain facilities, designated alternative entrance and exit routes, mandatory hand sanitisation, limited entertainment options and limited food/drink availability. We do not expect these measures to have a significant impact on your enjoyment of the experience and all measures will be taken with the purpose of securing your safety and those around you.

We will not be liable for booking errors which are attributable to you or which are caused by unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances as defined in clause 10.1.
1. Our agreement
A binding agreement for your hotel package will come into existence between you and us when we issue a confirmation. Please check all details on the confirmation (or any other document issued) immediately on receipt. It may not be possible to make changes to your hotel package later so you should notify us of any inaccuracies in any documentation within ten days of our sending it out. It may harm your rights if you don’t.
The suppliers whose services make up your hotel package make those supplies in accordance with their own terms and conditions which will also form part of your agreement with us.

Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are available on request from ourselves or the supplier concerned.
Pre Registration for Walt Disney World Resorts
Certain Walt Disney World Resort properties can only be firmly booked 11 months in advance of your proposed check-out date. If you are making a booking including one of those Disney Resorts during that time period, you will be given an option to pre-register at the time of booking. In this case, we will issue a pre-registration invoice setting out the details of your pre-registered booking and we will take a deposit however your booking will not be confirmed and no contract will be in place until we issue our full confirmation. If for any reason we are unable to confirm the booking within 11 months of your proposed check out date, we will contact you immediately and will refund any money you have paid in respect of your pre-registration. We will have no other liability and will not be responsible for refunding any other associated costs incurred and once we issue our confirmation any changes or cancellations by you will be subject to our usual charges in clause 8.
The key terms of our agreement are:-
You will enter into a binding contract with us when we issue our confirmation. If you then cancel your hotel package, you will be required to pay cancellation charges up to 100% of the cost of it, depending on how long before travel you cancel;
You can make changes to your confirmed hotel package in certain circumstances. We will make a charge for processing these changes;
We may make changes to and cancel your confirmed arrangements but we will provide suitable alternatives and pay you compensation in certain circumstances if we do so;
We are responsible for making sure your confirmed arrangements are not performed negligently but there are some limits on and exceptions to this.
2. Payment
When we accept your booking, you must make payment to us in the sum of £200 for Walt Disney World (including Disney Partner hotels) and Universal Orlando bookings or 15% of the booking total in the case of Disneyland Paris bookings. If booking 60 Days or less before departure, the full balance of the cost of your hotel package is due at the time of booking. In any event, the full balance is due no later than 60 Days before departure. If we do not receive any payment due in full and on time, we reserve the right to treat your booking as cancelled by you in which case the cancellation charges set out in clause 8 below will become payable.
3. Insurance
It is a condition of our agreement that you are covered by adequate travel insurance for your hotel package. Such insurance as a minimum must cover your losses sustained as a result of cancellation, medical issues, and repatriation in the event of accident or illness. Details of a policy suitable to cover your hotel package are available by contacting insurango.com. If you choose to travel without adequate insurance cover, we will not be liable for any of your losses howsoever arising, in respect of which insurance cover would otherwise have been available.
4. Special requests
Special requests relating to your hotel package must be advised to us in writing at the time of booking. Whilst we will try to meet or arrange your reasonable special requests, we cannot guarantee that they will be fulfilled. Special requests that have been noted on your confirmation or any other documentation do not amount to a promise to meet that request. A failure to meet any special request will not be a breach of contract on our part unless the request has been specifically confirmed.
5. Disabilities and medical problems
We will give you information about whether the hotel package you have chosen is generally suitable for persons with reduced mobility but if you or any member of your party has any precise medical problem or disability which may affect your chosen package, please provide us with full details before we issue our confirmation. We will only provide precise information on the suitability of the package taking into account your needs if you specifically request us to do so. Acting reasonably, if we are unable to properly accommodate your needs, we will not confirm your booking and/or if you did not give us full details at the time of booking, we will treat it as cancelled by you when we become aware of these details.
6. The price you pay
All prices are quoted in £s sterling. The prices quoted, shown on our website and in supplementary promotional material, apply at the time of publication, but are subject to change without notice. The price of your arrangements will be confirmed on booking and once you have paid for your hotel package in full or paid a non-refundable deposit on a booking, the price of your arrangements is confirmed and will remain unchanged even if the prices on our website increase or decrease.
However, we reserve the right to amend the price of your booking if there has been a pricing or system error. In this scenario, we will contact you when we become aware of the change or error to amend the price to the correct level. A full refund will be offered should you wish not to continue with your booking once the price has been corrected.
The price of your confirmed services is also subject to variations which occur solely as a direct consequence of changes in:
(a) the price of the carriage of passengers resulting from the cost of fuel or other power sources;
(b) the level of taxes or fees on your confirmed arrangements imposed by third parties not directly involved in the performance of the services or ticket, including tourist taxes, landing taxes or embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports and airports; or
(c) the exchange rates relevant to the ticket or service.
Price variations will be calculated by applying the cost differential we experience as a result of the above factors. Prices may go up or down and we will notify you about any variation by sending you a calculation explaining the variation no less than 20 days before you are due to depart. If your arrangements are a package, and if that means that you have to pay an increase of more than 8% of the price of your arrangements (excluding any insurance premiums, amendment charges and/or additional services), we will offer you the options under the heading ‘Change or cancellation options’ in clause 9.
If prices go down as a result of the above factors, we will make a reflective refund, but we will also deduct our administrative expenses from what is owed to you and this may extinguish the value of the refund due. Also, note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on price due to contractual protections in place.
7. Price Match
We believe that the prices of hotel packages on our website represent excellent value. Consequently, if you book with AttractionTickets.com and subsequently find the exact same package cheaper elsewhere with a fellow ABTA member, we will pay you the difference in price. Likewise, if you are yet to book and find the exact same tickets cheaper on another ABTA member site, we will match the price.
This promise is subject to:
Your notification in writing to us of the cheaper price, within 7 days of your receipt of our confirmation of your booking.
Our validation (at our absolute discretion) that the cheaper price published elsewhere on another ABTA member site, is in respect of arrangements, exactly the same e.g. for the same check-in dates, the same duration, the same board basis and includes the same extras such as theme park admission tickets as your confirmed booking with us.
The cheaper price must be in pounds sterling and must be available to book at the time you notify us of it. We reserve the right to validate any quotes given by email by a fellow ABTA member before agreeing to match the price.
8. Changes and cancellations by you
If you wish to make any changes to your hotel package after it has been confirmed, including if you wish to cancel it, you must inform us in writing as soon as possible. Your notice requesting a change or cancellation will only take effect when it is received in writing by us at our offices and will be effective from the date on which we receive it. Since we incur costs in cancelling your hotel package, cancellations will be subject to the charges set out below.
You may cancel any hotel package booking prior to its commencement (following the process outlined above) in the event that i) circumstances amounting to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances (as set out in clause 10) are occurring at the place where your hotel package is due to be performed or its immediate vicinity; ii) those circumstances make it impossible to travel safely to the travel destination, and iii) if the performance of your package will be significantly affected by those unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances. Note that we will take into consideration any advice from the Foreign Office to avoid or leave a particular country in determining whether or not you may cancel your arrangements under this clause. In the event that you may, you will receive a refund without undue delay of any payments made but this the maximum extent of our liability and we regret we cannot meet any other expenses or losses you may incur as a result.
If any member of your party is prevented from travelling, that person(s) may transfer their place to someone else (introduced by you and satisfying all the conditions applicable to the hotel package, including an agreement to these booking conditions) providing we are notified in writing not less than seven days before departure and you pay an amendment fee and meet all costs and charges incurred by us and/or incurred or imposed by us or any of our suppliers. Both you and the person to whom you would like to transfer your arrangements shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of any balance due and for any additional fees, charges or other costs arising from the transfer. If you are unable to find a replacement, cancellation charges as set out below will apply in order to cover our estimated costs. Otherwise, no refunds will be given for passengers not travelling or for unused services.
Charges in the event of a cancellation and amendments
In the event of a cancellation, you will have to pay the applicable cancellation charges up to the maximum shown below (The cancellation charge detailed is calculated on the basis of the total cost payable by the person(s) cancelling excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges which are not refundable in the event of the person(s) to whom they apply cancelling) :-

In the event we can meet your requested change, you will have to pay any applicable rate changes or any other costs incurred by ourselves or our suppliers as a result of the change in addition to applicable amendment charges above. Where we are unable to assist with making a requested change, and you do not wish to proceed with the original booking, we will treat this as a cancellation by you.
9. Changes and cancellations by us
Where we refer to a ‘price reduction’ in this clause and in clause 13, we mean that we will give you an appropriate reduction in the price you paid for the hotel package affected for any period during which there was lack of conformity as defined in the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 (unless that lack of conformity is attributable to you). Where we refer to ‘compensation’, we will pay you appropriate compensation without undue delay for any damage which you sustain as a result of any lack of conformity subject to the limitations and exclusions in section B of clause 13.
Changes and cancellations before departure
We reserve the right to change or cancel your booking (but we will not cancel less than 8 weeks before your departure date in unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, or where you have failed to pay the final balance when it’s due).
Most changes will be insignificant (e.g. a change of accommodation to another of the same standard or classification) and we reserve the right to make them. If we make an insignificant change to the main characteristics of your hotel package, we will try to notify the change to you as soon as reasonably possible before your departure but we will not notify you about any other insignificant change. We will have no other responsibilities to you in respect of any insignificant changes. Occasionally we may have to make a significant change to your confirmed hotel package (e.g. a change of accommodation to that of a lower standard or classification for the whole or a significant part of your time away) and we reserve the right to do so. A significant change is one where we significantly alter any essential element of your arrangements (other than the price) owing to circumstances beyond our control.
If we have to make a significant change or cancel before departure, we will inform you without undue delay and if there is time to do so before departure, we will offer you the choice of the following options:-
i (for significant changes) agreeing to the changed arrangements,
ii accepting the cancellation or terminating the contract for the hotel package and receiving a refund (without undue delay) of all monies paid; or

You must notify us of your choice within 7 days of our offer. If you fail to do so, we will contact you again, re-iterating the above choices and sums payable or refundable and if you again fail to respond within 7 days, we may terminate the contract and refund all payments made by you without undue delay.

Changes and cancellations after departure
If we become unable to provide a significant proportion of your hotel package after you have departed, we will try to offer you suitable alternative arrangements of, where possible, equivalent or higher quality than those specified in the contract. If the alternative arrangements we make are of a lower quality than those you originally booked, we will make a price reduction. You may reject the proposed alternative arrangements only if they are not comparable to what we originally promised to provide or if the price reduction we offer is inadequate. Where we are unable to make suitable alternative arrangements or you reject the proposed alternative arrangements in accordance with this clause, where appropriate, we will pay you compensation subject to section B of clause 13.
This clause sets out the maximum extent of our liability for changes and cancellations and we regret we cannot meet any other expenses or losses you may incur as a result of any change or cancellation.
10. Unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances
Except where otherwise expressly stated in these order conditions we will not be liable or pay you compensation if our contractual obligations to you are affected by any event which we or the supplier(s) of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due care, foresee or avoid. These events can include, but are not limited to war, threat of war, civil strife, terrorist activity and its consequences or the threat of such activity, riot, pandemics, epidemics, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, chemical or biological disaster, adverse weather conditions, the act of any government or other national or local authority and all similar events outside our or the supplier(s) concerned’s control. Advice from the Foreign Office to avoid or leave a particular country may constitute unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances as may any consequences of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, or any consequences of it so leaving.
Assisting you in the event of difficulty or unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances
We will provide appropriate assistance without undue delay in the event that you experience difficulty. Such assistance will extend to providing appropriate information on health services, local authorities and consular assistance; and helping you to make distance communications and to find alternative travel arrangements if necessary. We will charge a reasonable fee for such assistance if the difficulty is caused by you intentionally or as a result of your act or omission. In the event such assistance is needed please contact hoteladmin@attractiontickets.com or call +44 203 195 0655.
11. Complaints
If you experience a problem with your hotel package, please immediately inform the relevant supplier (e.g. your hotelier) so that they can take steps to put things right. You should also contact us by email on customerservices@attractiontickets.com. If your complaint remains unresolved and you wish to complain further, please send formal written notice of your complaint to us within 28 days of the end of your hotel package, giving your booking reference and all other relevant information. Failure to follow the procedure set out in this clause may affect ours and the applicable supplier’s ability to investigate your complaint, and could affect your rights under our agreement.

12. Your behaviour
If in our opinion or in the opinion of any person in authority, your behaviour is causing or is likely to cause distress, danger, damage or annoyance to any third party or property, or to cause a delay or diversion to transportation, we reserve the right to terminate your hotel package immediately. In the event of such termination our responsibilities to you will cease and you will be required to leave your accommodation or other service immediately. We will have no further obligations to you and will not meet any expenses, costs or losses incurred as a result. You may also be required to pay for loss and/or damage caused by your actions directly to the applicable supplier prior to departure from the service. If you fail to do so, you will be responsible for meeting any claims and costs subsequently made against us as a result.
13. Our Responsibilities
We accept responsibility as an “organiser” under the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018. Subject to these booking conditions, if we fail to arrange or perform your package in accordance with our agreement, we will remedy any resulting lack of conformity. If that is impossible or entails disproportionate costs (taking into account the extent of the lack of conformity and the value of the arrangements affected), we will instead pay you compensation subject to clause B of this clause. Please note that it is your responsibility to show that we or our supplier(s) have been negligent if you wish to make a claim against us.
Please note that it is a condition of our acceptance of the responsibility above that you inform us and the supplier(s) concerned without undue delay of the lack of conformity you perceive; and allow us a reasonable period in which to remedy it. Please contact hoteladmin@attractiontickets.com or call +44 203 195 0655.
B. Limitations of responsibility
In these terms and conditions, our responsibilities are limited, and duty to pay compensation is limited as follows:-
We will not be responsible, make a price reduction or pay you compensation for any lack of conformity injury, illness, death, loss, damage, expense, cost or other claim of any description if it results from:-
(a) the act(s) and/or omission(s) of the person(s) affected;
(b) the act(s) and/or omission(s) of a third party unconnected with the provision of your arrangements and which were unforeseeable or unavoidable; or
(c) Unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances as set out in clause 10.
We will not be responsible, make a price reduction or pay compensation:-
a) for services or facilities which do not form part of our agreement or where they are not advertised by us. For example any excursion you book while away, or any service or facility which your hotel or any other supplier agrees to provide for you.
b) for any damage, loss or expense or other sum(s) of any description which on the basis of the information given to us by you concerning your arrangements prior to them being confirmed, we could not have foreseen you would suffer or incur if we breached our contract with you; or that relate to any business.
Any price reduction or compensation that is payable will be calculated taking into consideration all relevant factors for example (but not limited to):-
(a) whether or not you have followed the complaints and notifications procedure as described in these conditions. It is a condition of our acceptance of liability under this clause that you notify any claim to ourselves and our supplier(s) strictly in accordance with the complaints procedure set out in these conditions.
(b) the extent to which ours or our employees’ or suppliers’ negligence affected the overall enjoyment of your arrangements.
(c) deduction that we must make to take account of any money which you have received or are entitled to receive from any transport provider or hotelier for the complaint or claim in question.
(Please also note that where any payment is made, the person(s) receiving it (and their parent or guardian if under 18 years) must also assign to ourselves or our insurers any rights they may have to pursue any third party and must provide ourselves and our insurers with all assistance we may reasonably require.)
Luggage or personal possessions and money
The maximum amount we will have to pay you in respect of any claim for loss of and/or damage to any luggage or personal possessions or money is an amount equivalent to the excess on your insurance policy which applies to this type of loss per person in total because you are assumed to have adequate insurance in place to cover any losses of this kind.
Claims covered by an International Convention
We rely on the terms and conditions contained within any applicable International Conventions for example The Paris Convention (with respect to hotel arrangements). You can ask us for a copy.
Any other claims which don’t involve injury, illness, death or damage caused by us or our suppliers intentionally or negligently; or other liability that can’t be limited by law.
The maximum amount we will have to pay you in respect of all such claims is three times the price paid by or on behalf of the person(s) affected in total. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you or your party has not received any benefit at all from your arrangements.
14. Jurisdiction and applicable law
These Booking Conditions and any agreement to which they apply are governed in all respects by English law. We both agree that any dispute, claim or other matter which arises between us out of or in connection with your contract or booking will be dealt with by the Courts of England and Wales only. You may however, choose the law and jurisdiction of Scotland or Northern Ireland if you live in those places and if you wish to do so.
15. Financial security for hotel packages
The Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 require travel companies to provide security for the monies that consumers pay for certain types and combinations of travel arrangements booked with them and for consumers’ repatriation in the event of their insolvency. We provide this protection by way of a bond held by ABTA – The Travel Association, 30 Park Street London SE1 9EQ - www.abta.co.uk. This means that in respect of all hotel packages, in the event of our insolvency, funds will be available to ensure that your hotel package can be provided as planned or if it can’t, you will receive a refund of the money you have paid for your hotel package. If you book anything other than a hotel package with us, your monies will not be financially protected. Please ask us for further details.
16. Passport, Visa and Immigration Requirements and Health Formalities
It is your responsibility to check and fulfil the passport, visa, health and immigration requirements applicable to your itinerary. We can only provide general information about this. You must check requirements for your own specific circumstances with the relevant Embassies and/or Consulates and your own doctor as applicable. Requirements do change and you must check the up to date position in good time before departure. Most countries now require passports to be valid for at least 6 months after your return date. If your passport is in its final year, you should check with the Embassy of the country you are visiting. For further information contact the Passport Office on 0870 5210410 or visit www.passport.gov.uk.
Special conditions apply for travel to the USA. All passengers must have individual machine-readable passports, and an ESTA (electronic authorisation) if travelling without a visa. Please check uk.usembassy.gov/. Up to date travel advice can be obtained from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, visit www.fco.gov.uk Non British passport holders, including other EU nationals, should obtain up to date advice on passport and visa requirements from the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of your destination or country(ies) through which you are travelling.
We do not accept any responsibility if you cannot travel, or incur any other loss because you have not complied with any passport, visa, immigration requirements or health formalities. You agree to reimburse us in relation to any fines or other losses which we incur as a result of your failure to comply with any passport, visa, immigration requirements or health formalities.
17.Covid-19: Limitation of liability
We both acknowledge the ongoing COVID-19 global crisis and accept our obligations to comply with any official guidance from governments or local authorities, both in the UK and whilst on holiday.
Please note that we will have no liability for any refunds, compensation, costs, expenses or other losses of any kind incurred by you (including, where applicable, the cost of medical treatment), in the following circumstances:
• If you, or anyone in your booking party, test positive for Covid-19 and have to quarantine for a period of time, or are notified or otherwise become aware that you have, or suspect you may have, come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 (or where they otherwise suspect they may have Covid-19) and have to self-isolate for a period of time. If this happens within 14 days of your departure date, you must contact us as you may no longer be able to travel. We will offer you the following options where possible and subject to availability:
- Postponing your holiday to a later date. We will notify you of any impact on the price the postponement may have (please note that you may have to pay full cancellation charges on some elements of your holiday, such as the flight, as well any increase in cost imposed by other suppliers);
- If not everyone on the booking is affected, you will have the right to transfer your place on the holiday to another person nominated by you, subject always to the requirements of clause 8;
- Cancelling your holiday, in which case we will impose our standard cancellation charges as at the date of cancellation by you. You may be able to claim these costs back from your travel insurance. If this happens whilst you are on your holiday, please notify us without delay and we will provide such reasonable assistance as we can in the circumstances. However, we will not be responsible for covering the cost of any curtailment of your holiday, missed transport arrangements, additional accommodation required, or other associated costs incurred by you. You must ensure you have travel insurance which covers these costs for you.
• You fail any tests, checks or other measures imposed by a supplier, airline, port or airport, border control authority or other government body or local authority or fail to submit for testing or assessment when requested to do so, and as such you are denied entry to board the flight, entry to the destination, access to the services or you are otherwise unable to proceed with the holiday, or that portion of the holiday.
You also acknowledge that the suppliers providing your holiday, including airlines, hotels and excursion providers, will need to comply with national and/or local guidance and requirements relating to Covid-19, and have implemented certain measures as a result. This will likely include specific requirements regarding personal protective equipment, such as use of face-masks by staff (and you may be required to wear a face-mask as well), social distancing, maximum number restrictions on the use of certain facilities, designated alternative entrance and exit routes, mandatory hand sanitisation, limited entertainment options and limited food/drink availability. We do not expect these measures to have a significant impact on your enjoyment of the holiday and all measures will be taken with the purpose of securing your safety and those around you.
