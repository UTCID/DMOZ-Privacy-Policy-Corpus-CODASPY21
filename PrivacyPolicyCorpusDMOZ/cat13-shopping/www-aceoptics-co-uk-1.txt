English Law
13.1
The contract will be governed by English Law.
WEEE REGULATIONS
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive is now UK law. The legislation aims to make producers pay for the collection, treatment and recovery of waste electrical equipment. The regulations also mean that suppliers of equipment like high street shops and internet retailers must allow consumers to return their waste equipment free of charge.
The amount of WEEE we throw away is increasing by around 5% each year, making it the fastest growing waste stream in the UK.
Much of the UKs WEEE ends up in landfill, where the lead and other toxins it contains can cause soil and water contamination. This can have a harmful effect on natural habitat, wildlife and also human health.
Many electrical items that we throw away can be repaired or recycled. Recycling items helps to save our natural finite resources and also reduces the environmental and health risks associated with sending electrical goods to landfill.
Distributors of new Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE) have a part to play in reducing the amount of WEEE going into landfill sites.
Ace Optics is obliged under these regulations to offer our customers free take-back of their WEEE on a like-for-like basis when they buy a new Electrical or Electronic product from us.
For example, if a customer bought a new camera from us we would accept their old camera and prevent it going into a landfill site by disposing of it safely. Customers must return their WEEE item to us within 28 days of purchasing their new item.
Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should now be marked with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol shown below:
Goods are marked with this symbol to show that they were produced after 13th August 2005, and should be disposed of separately from normal household waste so that they can be recycled.
NB. On receipt of your returned old camera we will refund the delivery charge to you.
WASTE BATTERY & ACCUMULATOR REGULATIONS
In accordance with the Waste Batteries & Accumulators Regulations which came into effect in February 2010, we now offer a portable battery recycling service.
You can bring any portable batteries such as AA's, camera & laptop batteries to either of our branches & simply hand them over to any member of staff.
Please note we only accept portable batteries for recycling, not industrial or automotive ones. You do not need to buy anything in order to use the recycling service.
You can also recycle batteries anywhere you see the symbol on the right including many supermarkets. Please visit Recycle Now for more information.
