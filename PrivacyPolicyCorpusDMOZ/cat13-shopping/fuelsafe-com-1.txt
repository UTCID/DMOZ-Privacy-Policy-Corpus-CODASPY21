PRIVACY POLICIES
Aircraft Rubber Manufacturing, Inc. dba Fuel Safe Systems is concerned about privacy matters for its customers, and is committed to protecting our customer’s privacy and personal information.
By accessing this web site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to make revisions to this policy and our other terms and conditions at any time, and will post those policies on our web site.
Our websites contain links to dealers and other third parties which are not under our control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such linked site.
INFORMATION: Customers are welcome to view our websites at any time without providing any personal information. When making a purchase of our product, we need to obtain certain information about you including your name, e-mail and mailing addresses, and your billing information so we can fill, confirm and ship the order, or contact you about the status of your order.
PERSONAL DATA: We will not use, disclose, sell, trade or disseminate any credit card holder data entered on the shopping cart payment form to any third parties except as necessary to process cardholder orders, process refunds, resolve Chargebacks, or as required by subpoena or order by a court or other governmental agency. Your shipping address and telephone number will be provided to a third party for delivery of your order.
Processing orders through our online certified shopping cart requires you to enter credit card information. Our shopping cart integrates with Authorize.Net® and the credit card processors using the highest payment gateway security standards. In addition, we have subscribed to their credit card security features. We will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information; however, we will not be responsible for disclosure of any information due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.
NON-PERSONAL DATA: For administration purposes, this site may use cookies and/or collect your IP address or domain name. No personal information is obtained in this manner. If you choose not to take advantage of cookies, you may set your browser to refuse them.

SECURITY POLICIES
The security of your information is very important to us. To protect that information, we maintain reasonable physical, procedural and technical measures to limit access to authorized individuals.
We utilize a certified shopping cart on our website, which sends transactions to the payment gateway using an end-to-end Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection to encrypt and transmit your credit card information. SSL is one of the highest levels of transaction security protocols available. This payment process connects through Authorize.Net® which adds another layer of fraud detection tools to protect against misuse of credit cards.
Even though we take these measures to protect and secure your personal data, we cannot guarantee that all electronic commerce is completely secure.
If you believe that someone has improperly used personally identifiable information about you or has made purchases that you did not authorize, please contact us or your credit card company immediately.
