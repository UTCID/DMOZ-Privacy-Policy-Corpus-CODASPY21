Consumer Terms & Conditions
About us We are UK Computer Group Limited t/a Comet, a company registered in England and Wales (company number 07105367) and our registered office is at 27 Charter Gate, Quarry Park Close, Northampton, NN3 6QB. About these terms When you shop with us, these terms will apply, so please make sure you read them! There’s lots of helpful information set out in these terms including details about price, delivery and returns. If you can’t find what you need or have a complaint, feel free to contact our customer service team on live chat or by emailing us at cs@comet.co.uk . Remember to quote your order reference number if you have one. If we need to contact you for any reason, we will do so by telephone or by writing to you at the email address or postal address you provided to us in your order. We may need to do this if we have any questions about your order or need to re-arrange a delivery. These terms are regularly reviewed to ensure they are up to date, so please check the date at the top of the page to make sure you have read through the latest copy. Each time you shop with us, the latest set will apply. If you see something that doesn’t look quite right, please feel free to contact us via chat or cs@comet.co.uk . Placing an order Once you have submitted your order, you should receive an acknowledgment email from us confirming receipt of your order. We will send a further email accepting your order (which will include an order reference number) once we are happy that we will be able to fulfil it. This is when a contract will come into existence between us. If for any reason we cannot accept your order, we will send you an email with a reason why. Sometimes this can happen if we don’t have enough of the products in stock, or if we have an issue with our delivery network. If we’ve had to suspend the supply of certain products, for example if there is a suspected technical fault or we are updating the product to reflect changes in regulatory requirements, we will be sure to notify you as soon as we can. We hope this won’t happen, but if it does, we won’t charge you for any unfilled order. Our products We will always do our best to make sure the information on our website is accurate and up to date. Sometimes, the images of our products on our website may differ slightly from the product you receive. If we do make a mistake (for example the price or description of the product on our website is incorrect), we will always put our hands up and tell you. If you have already placed an order and you are not happy to go ahead with the purchase, we will cancel the order and refund any money already paid. If you have already received the products, we will cover the costs for the products to be returned to us. Alternatively, we can confirm the order for you at the correct price. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) or PEGI (Pan-European Games Information) age ratings Some of our products may have age ratings, such as computer games. We will always make it clear if there is a rating for a particular product on our website. Please don’t purchase a product if you are under the certified age (or buy it on behalf of someone else who is), because you will be committing an offence. If we have a suspicion that you do not meet the age requirements, we may refuse to supply the product. By placing your order, you are confirming that you meet the age requirements to receive and view the title. Changing your order We can’t usually make changes to your order once we have acknowledged it. If you need to make a change, please contact us to cancel your order so that you can re-order. Delivery Our charges for delivery are displayed on our website, and will depend on the delivery method you choose. We’ll give you an estimated delivery date in our email accepting your order so that you know when to expect it. Whilst we are able to advise of a delivery date, we regrettably cannot confirm a precise delivery time. If am / pm deliveries are offered then these will generally take place as follows: am - between the hours of 07:30am and 13:00pm
pm - between the hours of 12:00pm and 18:00pm
Please note that in respect of some appliances and services we may not be able to indicate whether deliveries will be made in the morning or the afternoon We may refuse delivery, installation or removal services for safety or other reasons, such as local laws or regulations “Drop-off only” delivery option As an alternative to in-home delivery, we offer a “drop-off only” delivery option. Our team will deliver your appliance(s) to a secure location outside your home, such as a garage, carport, or other sheltered area. Signature If we require a signature at the time of delivery, you or a person over the age of 18 authorised by you (Eligible Person) must be available to accept the delivery. If we are unable to make the delivery on the agreed date because there is no Eligible Person at home then we will leave a card confirming that we have attempted delivery. It will then be your responsibility to contact us to arrange a new delivery date Instead of requesting a physical signature upon delivery of your appliance, our delivery partners may request confirmation of your identity in order to complete your delivery. Once you accept the delivery, our delivery partners will note your acceptance electronically. As part of the delivery process, we will take a photo of your appliance at the delivery location to confirm the package was safely delivered. We may use these delivery photos to verify delivery location and audit for quality purposes. In order for your appliance to be delivered, someone over the age of 18 must be onsite. The delivery team will unpack your new appliance and position it in a suitable room of your choice. We ask you to check your new appliance carefully for any visible damage, and also check your home for any damage that may be caused during the delivery, before you sign the delivery documentation. Any comment related to damage to the appliance or to your home must be entered in the appropriate section of the delivery documentation. Delays outside our control Sometimes there might be a delay in meeting the estimated delivery date due to factors outside our control, for example bad weather or carrier delays. We will make sure we keep you updated and will always try to provide you with a revised delivery date. If you haven’t received your order, and haven’t heard from us, please contact us so that we can update you. If there is a risk of a substantial delay, you will always have the option to cancel your order and request a refund. Failed delivery
If you aren’t in when we try to deliver, we will leave you a slip so that you can re-arrange your delivery. If we don’t hear from you, and you don’t rearrange your delivery, we will get in touch so that you can tell us what you want to do. If we can’t get hold of you, your order may be cancelled and you’ll need to re-order. Disconnection and Removal We will only disconnect your old appliance if you have selected the installation service when you place your order. If you have not chosen our installation service you will need to safely disconnected your old appliance before our arrival. Disconnection is not available for products that are hard-wired such as built in dishwashers, refrigeration or laundry appliances. We will only disconnect existing appliances if in our judgement the existing connection is sound and safe. If we are providing either a removal service or our disconnection service then before we arrive you must make sure that the old appliance is empty and, in the case of fridges and freezers, it is defrosted. Televisions must be disconnected from stands and brackets. Installation We offer an installation service for most domestic appliances in a domestic setting. Postcode restrictions apply to this service. You can check if installation is available in your postcode area at the checkout. This must be selected by you at the time you order the product. If you have not also selected the installation service you must disconnect your old appliance. See Disconnection and Removal above. Installation of appliances will be carried out to existing services within one metre of the appliance only (one and a half metres for Range Style Gas or Dual Fuel Cookers). Included in the installation will be a test of the appliance. If any of the following are found when we arrive at your property we will not be able to install your appliance:
Your old appliance has not been disconnected (excluding gas and electric cookers); Electrical supplies or plumbing which is unsuitable or which fails our pre installation test; Water supplies that are unsuitable or which cannot be isolated; Unsuitable waste or drainage facilities; Mechanical adjustments are required to the items to cater for external issues such as water pressure or where any alteration to existing electrical connections or supplies or plumbing are required alterations to pipe work are needed to satisfy the requirements of appliances with waterproofing devices.
Please note that the installation service provided by our delivery team will not be provided if:
no services or fittings are currently present; hard wiring is required; any additional work such as plumbing is necessary.
If we are offering free or reduced price installation as part of a promotion you must check the terms and conditions for the promotion to see if you are eligible. Returns policy Faulty or misdescribed goods We are under a legal duty to supply products that comply with this contract. Nothing within these terms affects your statutory rights. If you have received a faulty item, please contact us within 30 days so that we can provide you with a refund. We will just need your order reference number and a description of the fault so that we can investigate and make sure that other customers haven’t been affected. Remember, we don’t cover faults that happen because of misuse, accident, neglect or normal wear and tear. If you contact us outside our 30 day returns period, but within twelve months of receiving the products and depending on the nature of the fault, we may offer either a repair or replacement. Please note the warranty will be direct with the manufacturer. If you have received a faulty product, we will need it to be returned.

You will be able to request a refund if you have opened the goods to inspect them, but not if you have already used them (this includes the installation of any data or software). If we notice that the goods have been used, or handled in a way that would not be permitted in a shop, we may have to deduct any loss in value from your refund. Please make sure you return the product in its original, undamaged packaging, along with any accessories.  There are some exclusions, which are detailed below under ‘when we can’t offer a refund or exchange’. In order to return goods to us you will need a returns reference and a returns label. We will provide these to you once the return has been authorised. Please email us at cs@comet.co.uk so that we can arrange collection. We will refund you the price you paid for the products, plus any costs for delivery by the method you used for payment. We aim to refund you within 14 days of receiving the goods, or from receipt of evidence that the goods are on their way to us. When we can’t offer a refund or exchange We won’t be able to accept refunds or exchanges for the following:
products sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them (for example headphones); sealed audio, film, games, print consumables or computer software, once these products are unsealed after you receive them; and any products which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.
