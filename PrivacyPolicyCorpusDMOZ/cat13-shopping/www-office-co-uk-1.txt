If you do not agree with this Privacy and Cookies Policy, do not give us your details.
This Privacy and Cookies Policy is part of our Terms and Conditions. We reserve the right to change this Privacy and Cookies Policy from time to time and you should therefore check this page frequently to ensure that you are happy with any changes.

When you place an order with OFFICE, we ask for your name, e-mail address, delivery address, billing address, mobile phone number and credit card details (as well as expiry date) or other payment details. We keep a record of this information so that we can recognise you and fulfil any orders you place securely with OFFICE. We retain details of your orders and copies of any e-mail, social media or written correspondence you send us in order to maintain high standards of customer service. Once you have placed your order, you will then be able to check on your order status, manage your address book and stored payment methods and speed up the ordering process.
5.2 People who apply for a job with OFFICE
Where you apply for a job with us, we may collect from you and third parties (where relevant) Personal Information such as your CV, any references, your right to work, your name and contact details and any other information that you supply to us as part of your application.

7. PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES
We may receive Personal Information from third parties who collect Personal Information from you and pass it on to us. For example, our staff may give us emergency contact information as part of our emergency scenario planning and details of their dependents and of other people in relation to their employee benefits arrangements.
Where this is the case the third party is responsible for ensuring you are aware of this policy and to ensure you are happy with the ways in which your Personal Information will be used.
8. HOW WE WILL USE YOUR DETAILS
We are committed to protecting your Personal Information and we will only use or disclose your Personal Information to (i) perform the contract we have with you, (ii) comply with our legal obligations, (iii) for our legitimate business interests (such as to analyse and improve our Websites, products and services), (iv) personalise your experience when you visit our Websites, (v) where you apply for a job with us, process your application and (vi) for any other purposes for which you have given your explicit consent.
In order to process your order we will send you a confirmation email or we may need to contact you by telephone or email to verify your details before we are able to process and dispatch your order or we may be unable to accept your order.
Where you have explicitly consented or where we otherwise have a right to do so, we may from time to time contact you by post, electronic mail or mobile phone messaging about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the contact information which you have provided. Registration enables you to update your preferences of the marketing that you wish to receive and how we send it to you. You may opt out of receiving these marketing communications by simply following the instructions outlined in the email or mobile phone message.
From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes by email or mail. This will only happen where you have opted-in to receive such communications. We may also use the information to customise the Websites according to your interests.
9. SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will not share your Personal Information with third parties unless we have your explicit consent, need to share this information to enable us
to fulfil our contract with you, are required by law or where otherwise necessary for our internal business processes.
For example, where you purchase products from us, if you pay by card, your card details will be shared with third parties as necessary to process your transaction. We need to contact card issuers for validation checks and authorisation on all card payments. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorise payment to us, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery. OFFICE will validate the names, addresses and other information supplied during the order process against commercially available records (e.g. Electoral Roll data, Credit Reference Services) and a third party may be instructed to complete these checks. By ordering from our Websites (or via our App) you acknowledge that such checks shall be made. We may also need to provide your Personal Information to PayPal or other payment processors. Any Personal Information you provide may also be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of the information. These measures are taken as extra protection for you, to ensure your online shopping experience with us is as safe and secure as possible. We also share your Personal Information to third parties for purposes of delivery of the products to you and for the purpose of processing your order.
Where you have explicitly opted-in to such communications, OFFICE may, from time to time, share your Personal Information with its affiliated company, Offspring. Offspring may contact you by post, by electronic mail services or mobile phone messaging about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the delivery or email address which you have provided. You may opt-out of receiving any such communications by following the instructions outlined in the communication, contacting us using the details below or contacting Offspring directly.
Where you have explicitly opted-in to such communications, OFFICE may, from time to time, share your Personal Information with its affiliated company, Offcutsshoes. Offcutsshoes may contact you by post, by electronic mail services or mobile phone messaging about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the delivery or email address which you have provided. You may opt-out of receiving any such communications by following the instructions outlined in the communication, contacting us using the details below or contacting Offcutsshoes directly.
If we are sold or merged with another company we may disclose your information to a potential buyer, including your Personal Information and other information concerning your relationship with us, so that they can continue to provide our products and services to you.
We may share your Personal Information with third parties, such as Facebook, Instgram or via other third party advertising that may appear on other websites you use, where we have a legitimate business interest for doing so. Where we are relying on legitimate business interests for the processing of data, we will first consider whether or not these interests are outweighed by your interests, rights and freedoms.
10. TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EEA
All your Personal Information is stored on our secure servers or those of our group companies or suppliers which may be situated outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). All such transfers take place in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation.
Your Personal Information may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our group companies or suppliers. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy and Cookies Policy and the Data Protection Legislation when it is processed in, or otherwise accessed from, a location outside the EEA. This means that we will only transfer your Personal Information to third parties outside the EEA if that third party (a) is situated in a country that has been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to Personal Information, (b) has agreed (by way of written contract containing the European Commission-approved "model clauses" or by some other form of data transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission) to provide all protections to your Personal Information as required by the Data Protection Legislation or (c) we have your explicit consent to do so. Where any transfer takes place under a written contract, you have the right to request a copy of that contract and may do so by contacting us using the details below. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the UK is no longer a part of the EEA, references in this paragraph to the EEA shall mean the EEA and the UK.

12. SECURITY
We take security seriously and we take precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect and endeavour to only work with third parties who provide equivalent protections (for example, if you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted to ensure its security). However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us, or information stored on our servers, will be free from unauthorised access by third parties.
Please note, that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and, although we will take steps to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via the Website and/or our apps – any transmission is therefore at your own risk.
13. YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Please also note that, if we ask you to "opt in" at the point of checkout and you have already subscribed with us, we won't treat you as unsubscribing just because you don't re opt-in with every purchase.
You may request a copy of the Personal Information that we hold about you under the Data Protection Legislation, for which no fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you, please contact us using the details below, or write to OFFICE HR (SAR), Office Holdings LTD, Classic House, Martha's Buildings, 180 Old Street, London EC1V 9BP and we will respond to give you all the information we are required to provide by law.

We’re really sorry if you have received a phishing email that appears to be from OFFICE and would like to assure you that we’ll never contact you by phone or emails asking for you to confirm password.
We’d only ever ask for payment details should you be calling us to place an order for products of Gift Cards.
