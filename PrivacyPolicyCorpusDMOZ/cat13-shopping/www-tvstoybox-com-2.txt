We do not share or sell data. We collect billing and shipping information in order to process your order and deliver it to its destination. This information is used only by Tv's Toy Box and the couriers we use for the purposes of fulfilling your order. Personal information collected through this site is used only for our internal purposes. We will not sell your personal information, or authorize third parties to use such information for any commercial purpose, without your prior consent.
Personal InformationWe do not automatically collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Such information will be collected only if you provide it to us voluntarily in order to order products, enter a contest or promotion, or sign up to receive our eUpdate newsletter. We don't require that any personal information be provided in order to view our website.

allow you to order products, register for eUpdate and participate in special promotions;
improve the site by observing products that are most popular; and

Your personal information may also be used to create statistics about TvsToyBox.com that we use to measure our performance. These statistics do not contain any information that could identify you personally. TvsToyBox.com does not sell your personal information to any organization for any purpose.

You can choose not to receive the eflyers by selecting this option in your Ty's Toy Box account.
We offer Optional Registration. We recommend that you register as a customer in order to take advantage of the many benefits of maintaining an account. Unlike many other sites, registration is not necessary for placing orders. We offer a "buy now" option, which only requires the basic information required to process your order.

Credit Card info protected by 128bit SSL Encryption. The security of your personal information is paramount. All Credit Card Transactions are completed using a 128 Bit SSL Encrypted Secure Transaction. As we transmit the information to the Bank's Secure SSL Server, they require a 128-bit transaction and will not process a transaction without one. Even though 40 or 56 Bit transactions are very secure, our Bank's insistence on 128 Bit SSL means that there is never any chance of your information every being intercepted or decoded.
Password Protected Accounts. When you decide to register an account in order to take advantage of the address book, quick pay and order restoration features, your account information is secured by password protection assigned and maintained by you. If you forget your password, this information is only released to your specific email address recorded in your account profile.

It is simply an identifier transferred to your system from ours that helps us manage your transaction. It remembers items in your basket and currency selections. You can choose not to use cookies if you like. We do not require cookies to process your order however the lack of the memory feature may cause some frustration in certain situations.
