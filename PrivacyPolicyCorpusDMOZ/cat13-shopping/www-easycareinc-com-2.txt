EasyCare grants a nonexclusive, limited permission ("Permission") to display the Trademarks contained in EasyCare domain names, brand names and logos to the owner(s) of any web sites ("Owner") that would like to develop a link between their site and the web site owned by EasyCare. Links to EasyCare sites other than those using EasyCare domain names, brand names or logos are not permitted. The materials on Owner's site shall not imply any association with or relation to EasyCare or imply in any way that any materials from EasyCare sites are maintained within Owner's web site.
No changes or modifications to the EasyCare domain names, brand names or logos may be made. Use of the EasyCare domain names, brand names or logos for purposes other than linking to EasyCare sites is expressly forbidden. The domain names, brand names and logos must not be used or associated with any obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, indecent, profane, defamatory or unlawful site or materials in any way, or in any manner that would adversely affect the name, reputation and goodwill of EasyCare and its products. EasyCare retains and reserves all rights in and to EasyCare’s trade names, trademarks, copyrights and all other intellectual property with respect to its domain names, brand names and logos. EasyCare reserves the right to cancel the Permission at any time and for any reason. Upon receipt of such notification, use of the domain names, brand names or logos must cease and the link between the web sites must terminate.

EasyCare controls and operates its web sites from its offices located in the United States of America. EasyCare in no way implies that the domain names, brand names or logos are appropriate or available for use outside of the United States.
