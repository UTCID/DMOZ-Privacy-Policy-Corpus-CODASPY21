PRIVACY POLICY
Babyland may ask users to provide
information that personally identifies an individual in certain
circumstances, including for example when submitting an enquiry form or
order. We use personal information for two primary purposes:
To enable quick and convenient contact with specific individuals who require follow-up services from us.
To create a record of personal information that can be utilised in the
future within our marketing and customer service departments, should the
need for contact again be necessary.
All requests for removal from such future contact are always honoured.
By not providing the personal information as requested, users will
still be able to have access to the Babyland website, but we will not be
able to process certain requests that require further communication,
such as orders, enquiries and such like.
Babyland never
provides any user's personal information to any third-party for
commercial or other purposes unless required to do so by law. This is a
strict policy that is strictly enforced.
