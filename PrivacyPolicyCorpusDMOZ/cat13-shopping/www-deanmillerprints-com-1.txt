Aloha, and thank you for visiting our Hawaiian bedding superstore! Dean Miller Surf Bedding is the first company to specialize in tropical and beach themed bedding, and home decor. Our bedding company was started in May of 1999 when a couple of surfers couldn't find any cool comforters or duvet covers that would suit their love of surf and the beach lifestyle. So the boys decided to create their own line of Hawaiian bedding. With a little inspiration from the tropical islands, Dean Miller Surf Bedding was soon finding its way into bedrooms everywhere. Dean Miller Surf Bedding was the first company to specialize in Hawaiian and Surf themed bedding, and to help you bring some aloha home. We custom make our line of beach bedding here in sunny Southern California, and offer a wide selection of comforters, duvet covers, sheet sets, raffia bed skirts, and window curtains in a wide variety of colors, and fabrics. If you want to bring the beach indoors, and keep the summer vibes in your bedroom all year long, then Dean Miller Beach Bedding will have a comforter to fit your home's style
