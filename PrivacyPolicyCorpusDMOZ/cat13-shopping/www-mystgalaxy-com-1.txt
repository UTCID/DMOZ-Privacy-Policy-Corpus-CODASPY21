Information Disclosure
We may disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law.
Third Party Services
Third-party providers will typically collect, use, and disclose your information solely to perform
the services provided to us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as those who
provide payment gateways and payment processing, have their own privacy policies in regards to
collecting, using, and disclosing the information that we are required to provide them in order to
complete the purchase-related transaction. For those providers, we recommend that you read
their particular privacy policy in order to understand the manner in which your personal
information will be handled. Also remember that providers follow local jurisdiction, which may
be different from yours or ours. If you choose to proceed with a transaction that involves the
services of a third-party provider, your information may become subject to the jurisdiction’s laws
in which the service provider or its facilities are located. Once you are transferred or leave our
store’s website and/or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer
governed by our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of
other sites and encourage you to read their respective privacy statements.

To protect your personal information, we use industry best practices and standards to make sure
your information is not lost, misused, disclosed, changed, or destroyed. When you provide us
with your credit card information, that information is encrypted using secure socket layer
technology (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption. Please note that no method of
transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, but we follow all industry standards in order to
minimize and prevent fraudulent activity.
Privacy Policy Changes
We reserve the right to modify our privacy policy at any time. Changes and/or clarifications will
take immediate effect if posted on the website. If we make material changes to the policy, we
will notify you of the update. If our store is acquired by or merged with another company, your
information may be transmitted to the new company/owners.
