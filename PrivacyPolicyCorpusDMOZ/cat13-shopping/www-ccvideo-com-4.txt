Import Product Notes
Please note that some imported items are shipped without plastic wrap. This is standard packaging process used in many countries outside of the USA. Please be assured that the merchandise you receive are NEW unless otherwise noted. In the event an item is found to be damaged or defective, the item will be replaced with a like title. We do not substitute for another item. If the item is of limited quantity or cannot be replaced, we will credit your account upon receipt of the defective merchandise.
Stock Images, Rare Packaging
Product photographs are stock images and may not necessarily represent the current version of title. We do our best to maintain an accurate image database, but products are often re-released using the same UPC with slightly different packaging.
It is unlikely we would be stocking an out of print limited edition CD with a special cover.
Chances are that the item has been released with a different packaging.
