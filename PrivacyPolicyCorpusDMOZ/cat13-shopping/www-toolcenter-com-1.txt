Privacy Statement
Privacy Statement
forCyber Woodworking Depot, LLC
Cyber Woodworking
Depot, LLC has created this
privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The
following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for
this website:
www.ToolCenter.com
Information You Explicitly Provide
via Order Form:
To process your order, we require
your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and
credit card information. We use this information solely to process your order
and, if any questions should arise, to contact you about your order. In general,
we will try to contact you first by email and only if that fails, or if time is
critical, will we try to contact you by phone. We share this information, and
only that information which is absolutely necessary, with those third parties
that are involved in the processing of your order. For example, the financial
institution that issued your credit card and the shipping carrier that delivers
your order.
Choice Opt-In/Out Email List
This site gives users the following
option for adding or removing their email information from our email database.
If removed they will no longer receive email notifications of items on special
promotion or product announcements. This information is not shard with any other
entities.
Information We Automatically Collect
Shopper ID:
Upon visiting our site, we assign
you a unique Shopper ID and attempt to store that onto your computer in the form
of a cookie. This is used to keep track of your shopping basket during your
visit and between visits. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of being
assigned a Shopper ID, we recommend disabling cookie support in your browser
(please see your browser documentation for specific procedures). You may still
place an order by phone, fax or postal mail. Disabling cookie support will
disable the shopping basket feature of our site.
IP Address:
We record IP addresses in the
aggregate for monitoring the level of activity on our site, but we do not link
this to your Shopper ID, with the following exception: When you place an order
using our online checkout process, we record your IP address with your order to
help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this with the
financial institution that issued the credit card with which an order was
placed, or with law enforcement authorities, if we determine use of the credit
card was fraudulent.
Aside from the previously mentioned
third parties involved in the processing of your order, we do not share your
personally identifiable information with any other entities.
Security
We utilize industry standard SSL
encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online
checkout process. In addition, we utilize the same encryption standard when
transferring your credit card data to our fulfillment system.
External Links
We may include links to other sites
and if you decide to follow those links, we can't be responsible for the privacy
policies and content of those sites. Generally, we will let you know when a link
goes to another site.
Public Forums
This site at times will makes chat
rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please
remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your
personal information.
Changes
Order information:
To make any changes to your order,
please contact us via email or phone where we will be happy to assist you.
Cookies
Cookies
(we're not sure how they got this gastronomic name) are pieces of information
that a web site stores in your computer. Temporary cookies only last as long as
your browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard disk (they
take up very little space). Sites often use cookies to identify repeat visitors
and offer them personalized service.
IP Address
When you are connected to the
Internet, your computer has a unique Internet ID called an IP address. Most
people that connect through a dial-up service, such as America Online, get a
different IP address each time they login. Others might have a permanently
assigned IP address, called a static IP address. It is difficult or impossible
for a web site to collect personal information about you (i.e., your name, email
address, etc.) from your IP address alone, though a static IP address makes this
easier.
Shopper ID
A unique ID assigned to each shopper
that visits an online store with a shopping basket system. Each store you visit
will assign you a different ID. Many stores use a cookie to save your Shopper ID
for re-use when you return to that same store. Some shoppers find this
convenient and others find it objectionable.
SSL Encryption
A method by which information
transmitted across the Internet is scrambled to the point where it's virtually
indecipherable by anyone who should intercept the data before it reaches its
destination. Most all reputable online stores make use of SSL encryption to
request credit card information and other sensitive data from their customers.
Web pages where SSL encryption is activated are typically identified by a lock
or key symbol displayed somewhere in your browser. Refer to your browser's
documentation for the specific symbol and location.
