Terms and Conditions
You did not add any gift products to the cart. Check your available gifts!Terms & ConditionsShipping & DeliveryPrivacy & SecurityReturns & ReplacementsOrderingPayment, Pricing & PromotionsViewing OrdersUpdating Account InformationShipping & DeliveryShipping charges vary and depend on the type and weight of products ordered and delivery location. You may choose First Class Postal Delivery or within the UK Next Day Special Delivery by 1pm. Some items are sent by Courier where they are too large or heavy for the postal service. First Class Postal Delivery only includes limited compensation in the event of damage in transit. To ensure you are fully covered for damage please use Special Delivery.When you sign for Delivery please note that you are almost always signing a release from the Courier Company to the effect that the goods have been received in good order. This can make it impossible to claim for damage later (by us as the shippers). If there is any visible damage either do not sign or endorse your signature with the words \"visible damage\" or similar.Orders for the majority of off-the-shelf maps, including all of the Postcode Maps, will normally be despatched the same working day for orders placed before Noon. All being well that means the map will typically be delivered the next working week day, but that is out of our control and subject to Royal Mail or the couriers. We will email you tracking details where possible, but that is generally not possible with the Global Mapping range as they are mostly despatched from the warehouse rather than from our offices.Privacy & SecurityWe respect your privacy so we only use your contact details for purposes of our ordering, customer relationship management system and accounts system.
