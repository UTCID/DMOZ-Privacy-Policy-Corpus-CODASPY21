County Auctions Privacy Policy and GDPR
All Customer Data such as
Names and Addresses, Emails, etc are stored securely and are not disclosed to third parties.
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
A section of the GDPR concerns 'Legitimate Interest' and this is the basis of County Auctions compliance with GDPR. Basically, we sell Stamps and other Philatelic related material and, as far as we know, everyone on our list has an interest in stamps. On that basis there is a legitimate interest justification for sending relevant emails or our printed catalogues. Should you be no longer interested, we will happily remove recipients from our active list in a timely manner. An 'unsubscribe' option is included in all our bulk notification emails.

Your Bids are Confidential
We
only reveal information that you would find out at a public auction. For example: suppose we have a lot estimated at £10 and already have a bid at £15. You then telephone us. A typical conversation might be:
You: "I'm interested in lot xxx, can you tell me what bids you have on it?"
Auctioneer: "Sorry, we do not disclose other bids, it would be unfair to the other bidders. I can take a bid from you for it. What is your maximum bid?"
You: "OK, I'll go to £12."
Auctioneer: "I will enter £12 as your bid, but it doesn't win. Another bidder will now win it at £13." (One step above your £12 bid).
OR that last exchange might have been...
You: "OK, I'll go to £20"
Auctioneer: "I will enter your bid at £20. You will currently win the item at £16." (One step above the prior £15 bid).
You have committed the bid, but have been given no more information than you would have found out if you had been bidding in the room at a public auction.
We make sure we are fair to everybody.
