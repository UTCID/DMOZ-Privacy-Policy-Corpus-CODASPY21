safeguard

Personal Information
ARoseBooks.com collects personally identifiable
information from

This information is collected if you request information from us,

Once information is reviewed, it is discarded or stored in our files.
If we make material changes in the collection of personally

Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
Cookies:
We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience.
Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard
drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your
browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites
pages, or register with any of our site’s services, a cookie enables ARoseBooks.com to recall your specific information on
subsequent
visits.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your
web browser; however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be
able to fully experience the interactive features of the site.
Web Beacons:
A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey
around a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred
to as web bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party
services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with
cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content
on the pages of a web site.
We may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and web
beacons in the course of ads being served on our web site to ascertain
how many times you’ve seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable
information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon
use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on our
web site.
Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google, which uses
cookies to serve ads on this site. Google uses the DART cookie, which
enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visits to this site
and other sites on the Web. You may opt out of the use of the DART
cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a
cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web
beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn’t cause a problem with
our site, should you so choose.

Release of Information
If ARoseBooks.com is sold, the information we have
obtained from
you through your voluntary participation in our site may
transfer to
the new owner as a part of the sale in order that the

receive notice
through our website of that change in control and
practices, and we will
make reasonable efforts to ensure that the
purchaser honors any opt-out
requests you might make of us.
