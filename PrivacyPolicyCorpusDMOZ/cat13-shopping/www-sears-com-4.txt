Interest-Based Ads
Effective July 6, 2015
This Site may display ads from other companies. We also partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated third party sites or apps. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party sites or apps may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your device's browsing activity. For example, anonymous information collected by our ad networks or other third-party service providers across multiple sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. We may share your information with our service providers to permit them to recognize and serve targeted ads to you across the different devices you use. Before we share your information, we transform, or “hash”, it so that it is not in personally identifiable form.
If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising from us on other Sites, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out page.  You may download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out of personalized in-app advertising.
The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See http://www.networkadvertising.org for general information about the NAI and http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp for the opt-out page. You may also visit http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/ to learn about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from online or in-app behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies.
To learn more about interest based advertising and to manage your preferences for Sears and Kmart branded online ads, please visit the Sears Online Advertising Preference Center or the Kmart Online Advertising Preference Center.
These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to ad-serving on websites. If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests based on activities observed on our Site and/or web sites or mobile apps not owned and operated by Sears Holdings.
To learn more about interest based advertising and to manage your preferences for Sears and Kmart branded online ads, please visit the Sears Online Advertising Preference Center or the Kmart Online Advertising Preference Center.
