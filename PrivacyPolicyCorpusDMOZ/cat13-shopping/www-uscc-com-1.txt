Certain information such as Advertising IDs and persistent device identifiers may directly or indirectly identify you or your device and may be considered a type of Personal Information. Device identifiers include Electronic Serial Numbers (ESN) and mobile equipment identifiers (MEID) which are static numbers linked to a device. Advertising IDs are randomly generated codes on a mobile device that may be changed by the user. This type of information may help identify the same user across multiple devices or channels. Network and Device Information also may include call records, websites and URLs visited, advertisements clicked, WiFi usage, roaming, browsing history, IP addresses, and device data (battery life, application use, operating system, software configurations). We may collect cookies, web beacons and similar technology. Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more information.
Internet Activity and Cookie Data. Internet Activity, Cookie Data or other electronic network activity information may include browsing history, search history, Network Identifiers such as browsing history, search history, IP addresses, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet Web site, application or advertisement.
Location Information. Location Information is collected when you provide it directly to us and when you use our Services. Location Information may include your physical address, zip code, and a physical address associated with an IP address. Mobile device location may be the location of the tower with the associated sector and azimuth that the device is connected to, or the latitude and longitude of a mobile device within a given radius.

Education Information includes direct identifiers, such as a student's name or identification number, indirect identifiers, such as a student's date of birth, or other information which can be used to identify an individual and may include student records maintained by the educational institution or the completed level of education.
Collection of Information about Children
Our Services, with the exception of our Family Compass TM Service discussed below, are for general audiences and are not designed to be used by children. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of (13) thirteen, unless we have obtained parental consent through activities such as a marketing promotion.
Family Compass™. If you sign up for our Family Compass™ Service and establish a Family Compass™ account, you may elect to link internet connected device or product(s) (for example, a watch) (“IoT product”) used by a child under the age of 13 to their Family Compass™ account with the verified consent of the parent or guardian of that child.
To establish such consent, the parent or guardian must consent to the collection, use and sharing of the child’s personal information through the Family Compass™ Service which must be provided by establishing a UScellular Family Compass™ or data service account, and consenting to the collection and use of the child’s information on the Family Compass™ Portal, the Family Compass™ mobile application or on the relevant device before using the Family Compass™ Service with an IoT product used by your child.
In order to provide verified consent for a child under the age of 13, the parent or guardian must be a Family Compass™ account holder or be the account holder of a UScellular data service plan for the device connected to the Family Compass™ account (for which they were required to provide a government issued ID to verify identity).
In providing consent to link a child’s IoT product to your Family Compass™ account, you represent that you are a UScellular account holder, are the parent or guardian of the child under the age of 13, and authorize their use of the Family Compass™ Service.
If you do not respond to an invitation to connect to the Family Compass™ account within a reasonable time, UScellular will delete your online contact information from our records.
We collect from the Family Compass™ account holder personal information about children whose IoT products are linked to their Family Compass™ account, including an IoT product identifier.
This information allows us to activate Family Compass™ Services on the child’s IoT product.
We will not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in Family Compass™, but it is important to recognize that the nature of Family Compass™ is to share location and other related information with others linked on the Family Compass™ account.
Once the Family Compass™ Service is activated on the child’s IoT product, we may collect real-time location of the IoT product through GPS and WiFi tracker functionality.
We use this location information to provide Family Compass™ Service, including sending notifications to you and your other designated users of the Family Compass™ account about the child’s location, including when the child’s IoT product enters or exists an established geographic zone.
We may share location information associated with a child’s IoT product with other users you authorize to receive such information—which includes all other individuals connected through the Family Compass™ account.
We may share a child’s personal information with our service providers to provide customer service, troubleshoot issues with the child’s IoT product or the Family Compass™ Service, or in connection with other business purposes including the Detection and Prevention of Security Incidents and Fraud as described in greater detail in this Policy. One of these service providers that may collect personal information from the IoT device connected to Family Compass™ and serve as another operator on the Family Compass™ Service is Smith Micro, which provides the firmware software development kit for the IoT product.
Smith Micro may be contacted at 5800 Corporate Drive, 5th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA, 1527, privacy@smithmicro.com or 1-412-837-5300.
We do not otherwise disclose or share children’s personal information to any third parties and do not use personal information collected from children’s devices for marketing purposes. The Family Compass™ service does not allow children under 13 years of age to make their personal information publicly available.
Parents and guardians are always in control of the personal information we collect about their child through Family Compass™.
They may review or request deletion of their child’s personal information at any time, and also may revoke their consent and refuse to allow further collection of the child’s personal information.
To exercise these rights, please contact us at UScellular, 8410 W. Bryn Mawr Ave. Chicago, IL 60631-3486 Attn: Sr. Director, Privacy and Legal Affairs, email us at Dyno2KidSmartwatch@uscellular.com or contact us at (888) 944-9400.

In addition to the business purposes explained above, if you purchase a device or other equipment, activate your service, or otherwise intentionally interact with one of our Agents and Partners through their websites or store locations, they may request that you provide your Personal Information to complete the transaction or Services. This information may be passed on to us as well as be retained by the Agent or Partner.

To Account Owners and Authorized Contacts. Account Owners are parties who are financially responsible for an account (“Account Owners”). Account Owners may grant specific individuals access to their account(s) who are defined as Authorized Contacts (“Authorized Contacts”). Authorized Contacts may act on the Account Owner’s behalf for specific account activities.

If you are roaming domestically or internationally on the network of another carrier or WiFi service provider, your wireless telephone number, your location, and the numbers you dial and other information about your usage will be collected, stored and shared by the carrier providing the services. If you are roaming domestically, the privacy policy of the carrier providing your roaming services will apply. If you are roaming internationally, the collection and use of your roaming information may be subject to the regulation and privacy policy applicable in the country in which the carrier is providing services which may be different than the privacy regulations within the United States.
Aggregate or De-Identified Information. We may share with Third Parties information that has been collected about you that has been de-identified or aggregated in a manner that prevents others from identifying you. The de-identified or aggregated information may be used for marketing or other analytical purposes, such as to monitor subscriber network interactions, signal strength, dropped calls, or other customer experiences to evaluate customer experience and identify ways to better manage and improve our Services, and help make advertising more relevant to you. Once your information has been de-identified or aggregated, UScellular does not attempt to re-identify the information. We also prohibit Third Parties from attempting to re-identify the information or allowing downstream users to re-identify the information.
Advertising. As mentioned in our Cookie Policy, UScellular may allow third parties to place Cookies on your device when you access our websites, applications or advertisements and collect the preferences you demonstrate when interacting with them.

The Network and Device Information shared may include Advertising IDs or device identifiers in order to provide more personalized experiences, including for marketing purposes such as delivering interest-based advertising.

WIRELESS LOCATION INFORMATION
UScellular's network receives and tracks Location Information so that it may route communications, deliver wireless content and properly bill customers for Services. We may use your Location Information when you use our mobile applications and Services to provide location-based services ("LBS"), which are services that rely upon real-time physical, geographical Location Information provided by a device to enable a service to the customer. LBS may include roadside assistance services, fleet management services, or mapping services with turn-by-turn directions.
We may also disclose Location Information to third parties with your consent, or as required by applicable law including but not limited to public safety, fire service or law enforcement officials in emergency situations. We may share Location Information with your consent to third parties which provide advertising, as well entities that provide LBS or mobile applications that track the location of the mobile device using our network with or without our assistance. Once you provide your consent to transfer a mobile device's Location Information from UScellular to the third party that provides the LBS or mobile application, that third party's privacy policy will govern the use of that Location Information. You should understand the risks involved in consenting to the disclosure of a mobile device's Location Information before requesting an LBS or mobile application that collects and uses your Location Information.
UScellular retains Location Information only so long as needed to provide and support location-based services or mobile applications, as required by law, or as necessary for valid business purposes.
UScellular does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of Location Information delivered through its network, and any location-based service or mobile application may be disrupted or fail due to environmental factors and factors affecting satellite usage. UScellular abides by the International Association for the Wireless Telecommunications Industry ("CTIA") Best Practices and Guidelines for Location Based Services which can be found at the CTIA's website at http://www.ctia.org.

6. CPNI
Customer Proprietary Network Information ("CPNI") is created by our relationship with you as your telecommunications service provider. CPNI includes the type and quantity of certain telecommunications services you subscribe to and includes details about your calling activities, including call detail information such as the date and time of a call; duration of a call; call-originating and call-terminating phone numbers; and charges for a call.
CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number or information generated by text messaging, picture messaging or data services (such as internet access or usage and IoT solutions like vehicle or security monitoring).
We may use your CPNI to provision your Services; generate, bill and collect for your Services; respond to your requests; enforce our Terms of Service; and protect against fraudulent use of our network. We may use CPNI to recommend other wireless products and services to you. UScellular also may share your CPNI with its Affiliates and Third Parties to market UScellular Services on our behalf. The CPNI rules permit our use of this information for these purposes provided that we safeguard it from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We employ reasonable security measures to help ensure that your CPNI is protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Use of CPNI is subject to federal laws and regulations.
UScellular is prohibited under the CPNI rules from allowing our Affiliates and agents to use CPNI without your consent for the marketing of Affiliates' and agents' communications-related services to you. Your consent allows them to use CPNI to suggest their communications-related services to you or assist you with other telecommunications needs. Affiliates and agents have the same duties to safeguard your CPNI as we do.
When you become a customer of UScellular and no later than every two years thereafter, a notice will be provided to you explaining your rights about CPNI ("CPNI Notice"). You can expect to receive your CPNI Notice on your bill each month, in a separate mailing, or in a text message with a link to the CPNI Notice if you have prepaid wireless services. You must contact us as described in Managing Your Preferences below and in the CPNI Notice if you do not want to grant consent to our Affiliates or agents to use your CPNI to market their communications-related services to you. We will assume you have provided consent if you do not contact us beginning 30 days after the first time we provide you notice in your bill or in a text message.
7. PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION
UScellular takes reasonable security safeguards within its overall enterprise security approach based on the Center for Internet Security’s Critical Security Controls to protect against such risks as loss, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of information. UScellular uses a variety of commercially reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect information residing on its systems including, without limitation, server firewalls and physical facility security. These security controls and safeguards take into account the scope of the processing activities, the sensitivity of the information, the size of the entity doing to the processing, and the technical feasibility of the security measures.
We restrict access to information to those who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We also have appropriate practices and procedures designed to protect your information. We train our employees on the proper handling and securing of information which includes reporting potential privacy concerns. We protect the security of your information transmitted through our websites by using software which encrypts certain Personal Information you input or view.
We will not store your Personal Information beyond what is necessary for business purposes, including for internal service evaluation and quality assurance purposes, except as otherwise required by law.
We cannot prevent every unauthorized attempt to access information. If you suspect an issue with access to your information, please contact us by calling 1-888-944-9400.
8. PRIVACY RIGHTS
ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION
UScellular takes reasonable measures to assure you that the information we collect, use and share is accurate, complete and current. We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your information to allow you to correct inaccuracies at your request, unless the law or legitimate business reasons require us to keep it. Account Owners and Authorized Contacts who wish to review or change their Personal Information may do so by contacting us.
Account Owners and their Authorized Contacts are required to have their own PIN and security questions/answers for account protection. When Account Owners or their Authorized Contacts contact us via phone, they may be asked to provide their PIN or answer security questions, so that we may authenticate them before we respond to their questions or change their Personal Information. Similarly, Account Owners and their Authorized Contacts may be asked to present a valid government issued photo ID in retail stores for authentication purposes before we respond to their questions or change their Personal Information. Account Owners and Authorized Contacts should not provide account information, their PIN or online password to unauthorized parties.
We are not required to process requests for information that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or may be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In cases in which we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
CONTROLLING UNSOLICITED TEXT MESSAGES AND E-MAIL (“SPAM”)
UScellular is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial text messages and e-mail or "spam." Although UScellular continues to actively review and implement new technology to help prevent these activities, there is no currently available technology that will permit UScellular to totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited text messages or e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online may help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. For more information about this and other related topics go to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.onguardonline.gov.

DESIGNATED METHODS FOR SUBMITTING CCPA PRIVACY RIGHTS REQUESTS
You may submit a request to us by contacting us at:
California Resident Portal: California Consumer Rights Center
California Individual Rights Request toll-free number: 1 833 500 0439, beginning January 1, 2020.
You may be required to provide certain information for us to verify your identity before we process your request. We require that you provide authentication information (e.g. Name, Account Number, PIN, Address, and Email) depending on the relationship that you have with us. We will verify your identity based on the information you provide on the Consumer Rights Request Form. Once we verify your identity and validate your request, we will communicate with you to fulfill your request, or explain why we are denying your request in whole or in part. We may not respond to your request or provide you with CCPA PI if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the CCPA PI relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use CCPA PI provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
Requests for Household Information. There may be some types of Personal Information that can be associated with a household (a group of people living together in a single dwelling).
Requests for access or deletion of household Personal Information must be made by each member of the household.
We will verify each member of the household using the verification criteria explained above. If we are unable to verify the identity of each household member with the degree of certainty required, we will not be able to respond to the request.
Authorized Agents. You may designate an agent to submit requests on your behalf. The agent can be a natural person or a business entity that is registered with the California Secretary of State. Authorized Agents are required to verify your identity by providing us with certain Personal Information as described above, depending on whether you hold an account with us or not and the nature of the information your require, which we will endeavour to match the information submitted to information we maintain about you. Additionally, we will require that you provide us with written confirmation that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf, and the scope of that authorization. The agent will be required to provide us with proof of the agency relationship, which may be a declaration attesting to the agent’s identity and authorization by you to act on their behalf, signed under penalty of perjury. If the agent is a business entity, it will also need to submit evidence that it is registered and in good standing with the California Secretary of State. Information to identify and verify your agent can be submitted through the same mechanism and at the same time that you submit information to verify your identity. Please note that this subsection does not apply when an agent is authorized to act on your behalf pursuant to a valid power of attorney. Any such requests will be processed in accordance with California law pertaining to powers of attorney.

Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably or directly relate to the value of your CCPA PI to us, as determined by UScellular, and contain written terms that describe the program’s material terms. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, and we will provide more information about the nature of the program for any particular financial incentive program at the time it is offered to you.
