Returning items purchased from our Marketplace sellers
Retuns
Sears Marketplace items are sold by third-party businesses (called “Marketplace Sellers”) who sell items via our websites and shopping apps. Seller returns policies may vary. You can view the return policy of the Marketplace Sellers before you purchase an item by viewing the Returns and Refunds Policy section of the Marketplace Sellers profile page. Although the returns policies for these Marketplace Sellers may be different from Sears and Kmart returns policies, most items sold by Marketplace Sellers may be returned in new condition for a refund within 30 days of delivery. Some exclusions apply as certain items are not returnable (see “Non-Returnable Items” below), some item returns are subject to different time limits (see “Time Limits” below) and a restocking fee may apply for some items (see “Fees” below). All Sears Marketplace items MUST be returned directly to the Marketplace Seller and CANNOT be returned to Sears or Kmart (see “Return Processing” below).
Non-Returnable Items
All items are eligible for return per this policy except for the following:
Apparel or footwear that have labels or tags removed or have been worn
Any item damaged after delivery, however, the manufacturer’s warranty may apply. See the product literature or visit the manufacturer’s website for specific information and claim handling.
Custom, built-to-order or personalized items, including jewelry
“Whole house” standby generators
Sexual Wellness products
Holiday products, including but not limited to Valentine’s Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas which products were purchased after the holiday.
Electronics, music, movies, software, video games and collectibles that have been opened. However, if the item is defective, it may be exchanged for an identical item.
Some items that are considered hazardous materials may not be returned.  Please contact Marketplace Seller directly so they can discuss the return with you.  Hazardous items may include batteries, flammable liquids, computer equipment, or certain cosmetics or household goods, in addition to other common products.
Time Limits
Return requests must be submitted within 30 days of delivery except for refurbished Consumer Electronics items which must be submitted within 14 days after the item is received.
Items being returned must be mailed or shipped within 14 days of the date the return was authorized by the Marketplace Seller except for holiday products, including but not limited to Valentine’s Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas products which must be mailed or shipped prior to the holiday.
After the return period, the item is not eligible for return, however, the manufacturer’s warranty may apply. See the product literature or visit the manufacturer’s website for specific information and claim handling.
Fees
No fees are charged for processing a return or cancellation if the item received is incorrect, defective or where prohibited by law. Fees may be charged in the following circumstances:
A cancellation fee of up to 15% may be charged if a built-to-order or personalized item is cancelled more than one day after purchase but prior to shipment.
A restocking fee of up to 15% may be charged for mattresses, foundations, assembled/upholstered indoor furniture, water heaters and built-in home appliances, and any opened consumer electronics, patio furniture, gazebos, canopies, pergolas, air conditioners, dehumidifiers, space heaters and grills.
A restocking fee of up to 15% may be charged for the refusal of ordered items delivered via truck that are not damaged (does not apply to a small-package carrier such as UPS, USPS, FedEx Ground).
A pick-up fee may be charged if a Marketplace Seller arranges for a carrier to pick up the item.
If an item is normally non-returnable, a Marketplace Seller may, at its sole discretion, choose to accept the return but charge a restocking fee.
Return Processing
All item returns must be requested by the original buyer by contacting the Marketplace Seller prior to returning the item.  The preferred method is via the online order center, but the Marketplace Seller’s customer service email or phone may be used. Once the Marketplace Seller has approved the item for return, the item must be returned directly to the Marketplace Seller in new condition, with the original packaging and any included product manuals, parts and/or accessories along with the order invoice/receipt.
Exchanges
Except where noted above, exchanges are usually not allowed. A Marketplace Seller may choose, at its sole discretion, to allow an item to be exchanged instead of returned as an exception provided that the items being exchanged are the same price.
