Economy Candy Corp. respects your privacy. Consistent with our commitment to providing you a satisfying and helpful online experience, we have found that collecting Personal Information (defined below) through www.economycandy.com (the “Site”), affiliated sites and our retail stores (referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Stores”), helps us better understand the products and services most helpful to you. Our Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the types of information we may gather online and in our Stores and how we may use this information. Please read this information carefully.By accessing the Site and shopping in our Store, you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the end of the Policy) and review any changes since the last version. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use this Site and refrain from purchasing from us.USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY US
Economy Candy Corp. may collect two types of information about users: “Personal Information” (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, birthday, credit card number and the items you purchase) and “Aggregate Information” (such as information about how many users log on to our Site on a daily basis or frequency of customer visits to our Stores).We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products and services to you, and to help us develop and improve our Site and Stores and tailor our Site and Stores to your interests.USE OF PIXEL TAGS/CLEAR GIFS/WEB BEACONS
A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.NOTICE TO P3P USERS
The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (“P3P”) is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) that provides an automated, machine-readable mechanism for understanding the use of your Personal Information by the Web sites you visit. P3P uses a standardized set of multiple choice questions covering the major elements of a Web site’s privacy policy to provide a cross-section of how the particular Web site handles the personally identifiable information of its users. P3P-enabled browsers can automatically read this set of preferences made available by P3P-enabled Web sites and compare this information to the user’s own set of privacy preferences. For example, Internet Explorer 6.0 requires third parties to set cookies to deliver P3P “compact” cookie policies with their cookies, and other browsers may use this mechanism soon. To enhance your online experience further, the Site is now P3P enabled. For more information on the W3C and P3P, please visit http://www.w3.org/P3P/. Given certain limitations in the parameters chosen by W3C, however, the P3P mechanisms may not describe the Site’s privacy practices as accurately as this Policy. Accordingly, where discrepancies exist between this Policy and the P3P “compact” policies, this Policy shall control.SECURITY AND SSL
Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from “http” to “https.” Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won’t be able to connect to the server and therefore won’t be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at 1-866-939-5267.SUBMISSIONS OF USER CONTENT
