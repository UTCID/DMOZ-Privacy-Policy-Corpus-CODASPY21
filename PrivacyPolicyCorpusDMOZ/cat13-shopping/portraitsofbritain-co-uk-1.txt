This page explains our approach to privacy on our site and how it affects you.Short versionWe collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services.

This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.Facebook, Twitter and other social networksThese services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). You will need to check your privacy settings on those services in order to check or prevent this.Mailing listWe may send you email notifications regarding your service (such as invoices) or which you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or notifications when a report is completed).
