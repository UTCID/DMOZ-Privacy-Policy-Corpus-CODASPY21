Payments
We take great pride in making payment as easy and painless as possible. Therefore, we accept the following forms of payment:
Mastercard
Visa
American Express (AMEX)
EFTPOS
Cash
Direct Deposit
Interest Free Financing
Orders can be made online via our secure ordering system, over the phone or by visiting our store.
Credit card purchases must be verified by Mastercard Securecode, Verified by Visa or American Express Safekey prior to shipping.
Holding of Diamonds and Deposits
We can only hold a diamond upon payment of a deposit. Because our diamonds are in high demand, we highly recommend that you pay a deposit as quickly as possible, as this is required in order to proceed. The fastest and easiest way to pay is via credit card or via bank transfer and emailing us the receipt.
Upon payment of a deposit, you shall be issued a receipt for your deposit (either electronic or in writing). This receipt gives all the particulars of the proposed purchase. Upon completion and payment of the final balance, you shall be issued with a tax invoice.
If no work has been done on our part (eg importing the diamond, making the ring), the deposit is fully refundable. However, once we begin work, or importing an international selection diamond, normal return policies shall apply.
Discount Policy
Because we are one of only a handful of retailers that publish prices online, our prices are not negotiable.
International Selection (Policy & Procedure)
In order to purchase a diamond from our international selection, a minimum deposit of $200 is payable.
Because the price of our international selection fluctuates from day to day with the exchange rate, the price payable will be the price shown on the day that the deposit is paid.
In normal circumstances, it takes between 5-7 days for us to receive the diamond from overseas.
Once the diamond has arrived, we shall perform the analysis within 48 hours and email you the following for you to approve:
Microscopic Photo
Ideal-Scope Image (Round Brilliant Stones Only)
AGS ASET Image (Fancy Cut Stones Only)
360 Degree Animation
Full proportion and extra cut grading information
Because of extra shipping and import charges, we don't allow comparison shopping for diamonds in The International Selection.
Delivery
All prices displayed on our website include delivery within Australia and New Zealand.
Within Australia, delivery is done via overnight an insured courier service.
For New Zealand shipments, delivery is done via Fedex, which takes between 1-2 days.
Urgent and Saturday Deliveries
Please contact us if you require "Same Day" or Saturday delivery. Extra charges do apply.
Definition of Eye-Clean
Our definition of eye-clean is that a diamond is eye-clean, if a person with 20/20 vision, in diffused office lighting conditions can not see any visible inclusions face up from a distance of 25cm.
We chose the distance of 25cm, as that is the distance the AGS used when researching and developing their cut grading system, and is said to be "distance of most distinct vision" for the average human being with normal eyesight.
Please keep this in mind if you are clarity-sensitive (near-sighted or otherwise) and possibly re-assess the colour and size of diamond that you will buy.
"Fair Go" Return Policy
Over the 17 years we have been operating online, we have only had a few returns. That said, should you need to return a diamond for whatever reason, we want to make it as easy as possible for you, whilst discouraging fraud and allowing us to keep our costs down to maintain our low prices.
Our Obligations as Required by the Law
Should your purchase be defective or misrepresented in anyway, we will either refund or exchange your purchase at your discretion.
Diamonds From Our International Selection Bought Online
An International Selection diamond bought online (unsighted) can be returned for exchange or refund within fourteen days of us emailing you the analysis. Because of the costs involved in importing these diamonds, $200 is charged to allow us to send the diamond back.
International Selection Purchases Made in Person
International Selection purchases that have been viewed in our Perth showroom before final purchase can not be exchanged or returned, unless defective or misrepresented.
Crossfire and Signature Series Diamonds
A Crossfire or Signature Series diamond can be returned for exchange or refund for any reason whatsoever within thirty days of you receiving it. There are no shipping fees charged and you will be refunded your full purchase price.
Rings and Set Diamonds
Since a great deal of time and labour is spent manufacturing our hand-crafted rings, they can not be returned or refunded. However, our policy is to make you, the customer 100% happy, therefore we will endeavour to fix any problems that may occur. In addition to this, if you change your mind about the design, we are able to upgrade or alter the ring at a heavily discounted price.
Return Procedure
Due to issues with insurance, returning a diamond worth thousands of dollars may be a difficult, time consuming and costly experience. However, we've taken the pain out of returning a diamond by sending our own insured courier to come and pick it up for you. This service is included in your purchase price.
Once we receive the diamond or piece of jewellery, we will analyse it in our lab and employ third parties if needed to analyse the item. Once we are satisfied you've returned what we sent out, we'll process the exchange or refund. Be aware that the refund will be in the same form of payment as you originally paid - so if you paid by credit card, we'll refund your credit card etc. Please be aware that whilst we process refunds immediately, your credit card company may take up to five working days to credit your account.
Damaged Diamonds
All diamonds returned must be in an undamaged condtion, as per the certificate and our microscopic photograph. We can not accept returns for diamonds that are damaged (chips, cleavage plane fractures etc).
Consignment Policy
Outside the stated return and buy-back periods, we offer a consignment service for any stones bought from us in the past, in addition to any other ideal cut diamonds bought elsewhere.
The standard fee is 15% of the GST-exclusive sale price, and more details are available by contacting us directly.
Upgrade Policy
A Crossfire or Signature Series diamond bought from us can be upgraded at any time to a more expensive diamond in our Crossfire Range or Signature Series. In order to simplify the upgrade, we ask that you keep your original invoice and certificate.
Buy-Back Policy
A Crossfire diamond bought from us can be returned for 80% of the purchase price within one year of purchase. Please note this only applies to Crossfire branded diamonds, not settings or International Selection diamonds.
Guarantee
Jogia Diamonds International guarantees that all diamonds purchased from us have not undergone any enhancement whatsoever.
We recommend that diamonds and diamond jewellery be insured at all times. If the diamond is given to a local jeweller to be made into a piece of jewellery, you should ensure that the jeweller is insured for any loss or damage caused to the diamond. It is advisable to get all your jewellery inspected and valued by us or a professional jeweller at least every two years.
Conflict Diamonds
All diamonds and diamond jewellery from Jogia Diamonds International are guaranteed to be conflict free. It is our policy to buy diamonds from reputable, well established diamond cutters and wholesalers who in turn guarantee us that the diamond they sell us are conflict free.
Each invoice that our buyers receive from us one of these statements will appear on our company's letterhead:
The diamond herein invoiced has been purchased from legitimate sources not involved in funding conflict and in compliance with United Nations Resolutions. The seller hereby guarantees that this diamond is conflict free, based on personal knowledge and/or written guarantee provided by the supplier of this diamond.
