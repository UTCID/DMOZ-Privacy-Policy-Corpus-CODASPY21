If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms and Conditions, do not use or access, or continue to use or access, the Websites.

You acknowledge that these Websites contains information, data, data compilations, software, photographs, typefaces, text, graphics, sounds, images, and other material (collectively, "Content") that are the property of PrestigeTime.com or other third parties and that such Content is protected by United States and/or international copyright laws.

You agree not to display or use such marks in any way, without obtaining permission of the owner of the trademark.
Use Rights
You have permission to view, electronically copy and print hard copies of pages from these Websites solely for personal, non-commercial purposes related to placing an order or shopping with PrestigeTime.com. Except as expressly stated in the Terms and Conditions, you may not reproduce, distribute, display, sell, lease, transmit, create derivative works from, modify or otherwise exploit any images, photographs and/or any other variation of pictorial form on these Websites.

Errors and Inaccuracies
While our goal is to provide complete, accurate, up-to-date information on our Websites, it is not possible to ensure that any website is completely free of human or technological errors. In order to give you the opportunity to view our products in great detail, some products may appear larger or smaller than their actual size in our photographs; and since every computer monitor is set differently, color and size may vary slightly. These Websites may contain typographical mistakes, inaccuracies, or omissions, and some information may not be complete or current. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, including after an order has been submitted, and to change or update information at any time without prior notice, including inaccurate or erroneous prices. In the event of a pricing error discovered after an order has already been placed, we will notify you of the error and we will do our best to work with you to reach a mutually acceptable solution. We do, however, reserve the right to cancel the order and notify you of such cancellation. You also have the right to cancel the order in the event of a pricing error. If the order is cancelled by us, then you may replace the order at the corrected price. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Contractual Obligation
ANY PURCHASE ORDERS, QUOTATIONS OR OTHER EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING A SALE OF A WATCH SHALL NOT RESULT IN A BINDING CONTRACT UNLESS AND UNTIL PRESTIGE TIME ISSUES A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION TO THE PURCHASER.
