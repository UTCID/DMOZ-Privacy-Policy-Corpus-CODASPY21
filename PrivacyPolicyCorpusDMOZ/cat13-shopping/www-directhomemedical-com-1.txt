FREE SHIPPING OPTIONS YOU CAN APPRECIATE!We're currently offering FREE Ground Shipping on all orders! FREE Ground Shipping packages may be shipped via UPS or USPS depending on service availability and price. We also offer FREE USPS Priority Shipping within the US on all orders over $99; and FREE 2nd Day Air on many popular CPAP machines and oxygen concentrators!
WILL YOU SHIP ORDERS ANYWHERE?We only offer shipping to addresses within the United States, U.S. Territories (including Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, etc.), and Canada. At this time we DO NOT ship to any other international destinations.
WILL YOU SHIP ORDERS TO POST OFFICE (PO) BOXES?Yes. Orders shipping to PO Boxes are always shipped via the US Postal Service (USPS). All standard shipping and service rates apply.
WILL YOU SHIP ORDERS TO MILITARY APO/FPO ADDRESSES?Yes. Orders shipping to military addresses are always shipped via the US Postal Service (USPS). APO/FPO packages can only be shipped via First Class or Priority Mail. Express Mail is not offered to military addresses.
ONCE AN ORDER IS PLACED HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO BE SHIPPED?We ship more than 95% of all orders within 1 business day (Monday - Friday). Our final shipments leave at approximately 4pm Eastern each day, so Express and Overnight orders placed before 3pm will usually ship the same day. If your order is going to be delayed more than a day or two we will notify you using the contact information provided with your original order. (Orders for prescription items will ship immediately once the prescription is received unless the prescription is on file prior to the order being placed.)
HOW ARE ORDERS SHIPPED?We offer shipping via the United States Postal Service (USPS) and United Parcel Service (UPS). All shipments to Canada are sent via USPS Priority International. When you place your order online you'll be able to select your preferred method of shipment directly at checkout. All shipping methods and costs will be displayed prior to selection. Review the information below to learn more about individual shipping services and options. Shipping options may be limited on some orders depending on weight, contents, or value.
CAN I TRACK MY SHIPMENT?Once your order ships we will send you an email with shipping confirmation and a tracking number. Please add our email address -- careteam@directhomemedical.com -- to your address book to ensure our emails get through to you. Packages can be tracked directly from our Order History Page, by clicking links provided in your tracking email, or by entering your tracking number at UPS.COM or USPS.COM.
CAN I GET SIGNATURE CONFIRMATION ON MY SHIPMENT?For safety and security, we automatically include Signature Confirmation on all orders of $600 or more. In most cases we can also include signature confirmation, on request, for orders under $600. Simply email or call us after your order is placed to make your Signature Confirmation request.
ARE CANADIAN ORDERS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS CHARGES?While most shipments to Canada arrive at their destinations within 6-8 days of shipment without any additional charges, fees or delays; DirectHomeMedical CANNOT predict and has no control over Canadian Customs. All shipments to Canada are clearly marked as medical supplies. If import duties or delays are imposed by Canadian authorities then those charges are borne by the customer and cannot be reimbursed by DirectHomeMedical.
A NOTE ABOUT SHIPMENTS WITH BATTERIESDue to Federal Regulations lithium ion battery packs cannot be shipped via air unless they are contained within a device, like a CPAP machine, nebulizer or oxygen concentrator.
