Effective as of August 21, 2008
Email. We do not “harvest” email addresses from our website visitors or anyone else, nor do we send unsolicited commercial bulk email (spam) to our customers or website visitors.
Your Information. Personal and/or business information provided to us by our website visitors, customers, clients and newsletter subscribers is treated confidentially and is not sold to anyone for any reason. If you provide such information to us by email, telephone, letter, an online form on our website or other means, we use that information only to provide you with our services and/or products or to respond to your requests.
Our Contact page form collects some or all of the following personally identifying information:
Name
Company Name
Address, City, State, Zip Code
Phone number or email address (at least one is required)
None of the above personally-identifying information is stored on our website, and thus we provide no online process for individuals to review and request changes to any of their personally identifiable information collected through our website’s online form.
E-commerce/Shopping Cart. We’ve updated our website with our own shopping cart, so you’ll never need to leave our website to purchase Corium 21 online. When you make a purchase at corium21.com, you have the option of saving time on future visits by setting up a login account called My Account where you can update your contact information, password and shipping address, and see both the status of your current order(s) and your previous order history. No credit card information is stored in My Account, so we provide no way to update your credit card information.
Web Hosting. As with most web hosting companies, ours records and stores only the following information about our website visitors: the numerical IP address or domain name from which they access the Internet; the date and time our website is accessed; the pages you visited and whether they successfully downloaded to your browser; and sometimes the Internet address of the website from which you may have accessed our website (such as Google.com). We use this information only to understand how many visitors we get and how visitors use our website so that we can improve it. We do not sell this information to anyone for any reason.
Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy. In the event that we make changes to or update this Privacy Policy; in that event, we will post them to this page of our website with the corresponding Effective Date.
If you have any privacy concerns, please contact us.
