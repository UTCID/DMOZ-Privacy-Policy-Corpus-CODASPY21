20.	Lapsed Accounts: In order to keep “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.”
membership roster current, if a Member does not access his or her account for a period of “90” days or more, “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” may, in its sole discretion, terminate such Member's account. “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” will endeavor to notify a Member of “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” intent to terminate such Member's account by notice to such Member's provided email address at least “90”
days prior to deactivation. If the Member fails to respond to such email notice with “90”
days after the day it is sent by “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.”, such Member's account will be terminated as noted above. Therefore, “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” strongly recommends that all Members keep their accounts and contact data current and in use. While “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” desires to prevent active accounts from being terminated prematurely, “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” has no obligation to maintain accounts that appear to “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” to have been abandoned. Each Member agrees that failure to access his or her account for “90” days or more conclusively indicates that such Member's account has been abandoned and that the account may therefore be terminated.
21.	Verify Members' Address:
“Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.” reserves the right to contact a Member via email to verify the accuracy of account information (including the Member's correct name and address) that is needed to provide the Member with the information he or she requested from “Hal Froot Enterprises LTD Inc.”.
