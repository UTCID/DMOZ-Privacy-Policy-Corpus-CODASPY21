Privacy Policy
Welcome! We (“we,” “us” or “our”) are the developer of the services offered (the “Services”) via our websites and mobile applications (each, a “Destination”). As such, we want to provide you with this, our privacy policy. Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to personally identifiable data and other information that is collected from visitors to a Destination and users of the Services.
In order to make your visits to our Destinations both enjoyable and responsive, we collect certain information when you visit us online. Your use of our Destinations and/or the Services confirms your acceptance of this privacy policy and your agreement to be bound by it.
How Your Information is Collected
When you place an order on a Destination or by using the Services, you may be prompted to provide (and we may collect) certain types of information, such as your name, postal address (for shipping and billing), e-mail address, telephone number, financial information (such as your credit card number) and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, transaction information, device information and product and service preferences. We also may collect the e-mail addresses of customers who communicate with us via e-mail and those who provide their e-mail address when joining a mailing list. In addition, we may collect personally identifiable information that is provided to us by visitors to a Destination or who use the Services in connection with contest participations, survey information and member account registrations.
We may collect aggregate or non-identifiable (anonymous) information from all visitors to a Destination and/or users of the Services, regardless of whether they place an order with us, volunteer such information, communicate with us, join a mailing list or otherwise (such as language, zip code, unique device identifier and location). We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to a Destination and Services, the number of visitors to each page of a Destination , the number of users of the Services, the domain names of our visitors’ internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with Destinations and Services. We may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners, or disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe a Destination and/or the Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
We may also collect information about you from commercially available sources. Such information may include your name, address, email address and demographic data. The information that we may collect from these sources may be used along with the information that we collect from you when you visit a Destination or use the Services.
Cookies and Other Information Gathering Tools
Like many Destinations, we use “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that reside on your computer and identify you as a unique user. Cookies allow us to, among other things, measure activity on a Destination or through the
Services and to personalize your experience. For example, cookies enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a user name and password. Cookies also allow us to track your status or progress when ordering products and services from us. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. However, if you reject or delete cookies you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features on a Destination or the Services. We also use other common information gathering tools such as web beacons and embedded web links.
Children’s Information
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, and we do not target any Destination or any of the Services, to children under the age of eighteen (18).
Our Terms of Use prohibit individuals younger than eighteen (18) years old from accessing or using the Services in any manner.
How We Use Your Information
We use your personally identifiable information to fulfill purchases that you make through a Destination and/or the Services, for marketing purposes, and to provide service and support.
Unless you opt-out in accordance with the procedure set forth below, if you provide us with your postal or e-mail address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about products, services and upcoming events. We reserve the right to share this information with affiliates and other reputable organizations for service, support and marketing purposes, and so that they may offer products and services that we believe will be attractive to our customers and to those who have subscribed to a mailing list.
In addition, we may share your information with third parties in order to: (i) respond to the requests of police and governmental authorities, (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect our rights or (iv) protect the personal safety of our personnel and third parties. We may also share or transfer your information with third parties for business reasons, such as in the context of the sale or merger of our company or business.
When you provide us with your credit card information we redirect that information to certain third parties only for the purpose of payment processing in accordance with their own privacy and security policies.
Third-Party Ad Servers
We may use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on a Destination and/or through the Services. Such providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to a Destination and use of the Services. They may use information about your visits to a Destination or use of the Services to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by many major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process (such as your name, phone number or postal or email address).
The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) allows for the central opting out of all of its members’ cookies from a single opt-out page. If you prefer not to receive certain behavioral advertising, please click on the following link: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
If you delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
We also work with third parties to monitor certain pages of Destinations and the Services for the purpose of reporting website traffic and other advertising statistics. These third parties may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about the visitors to a Destination or the users of the Services. However, no personally identifiable information is transferred to these third parties.
Links to Third Party Websites
A Destination and the Services may contain links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. We do not control those websites or make any representations or warranties about their use or the third-party policies that govern such use. Any personal information that is obtained by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third-party websites.
Integrating Third-Party Services within the Services
One of the special features of the Services is that they allow you to enable various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services (“Third-Party Services”), to be directly integrated into your experience. To take advantage of this feature, we may ask you to provide us your username and password for the relevant Third-Party Services. By enabling such Third-Party Services, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these service providers for this purpose. When you add a Third-Party Service account to the Services, we will collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Services to access that Third-Party Service and your data contained within that Third-Party Service. However, please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and we will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Service that may be enabled within the Services.
Security
We maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures, but we can’t guarantee that your information will be secure in every circumstance.
Notices
If we are required to provide you with notice of a particular event or incident, we will send you such notice by mail, email or telephone.
Changing Your Information
If you believe that you have provided us with information that is incorrect or that needs to be updated you may contact us, in the case you are using a mobile app, via the Contact Us option on the drawer menu in the upper left corner of the screen or, in the case you are using a website, via the Contact Us page.
Opt-Out / Unsubscribe
You can access a Destination or the Services without providing any personally identifiable information. However, if you do not provide any personally identifiable information you may not be able to use certain features of a Destination or the Services (such as registering, opening an account or making purchases). If you would like to discontinue receiving marketing-related e-mails and opt-out of certain uses of your personally identifiable information by us, please contact us, in the case you are using a mobile app, via the Contact Us option on the drawer menu in the upper left corner of the screen or, in the case you are using a website, via the Contact Us page.
Exclusions
This Privacy Policy will not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us through a Destination or the Services or through any other means, including, without limitation, information posted to any public areas of a Destination or the Services, any feedback or ideas for new products or modifications to existing offerings, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information will be deemed to be non-confidential and we will be free to use, reproduce, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation, or compensation or attribution to you.
Other Terms and Conditions
Your access to and use of a Destination and the Services are subject to the Terms of Use.
How to Contact Us
If you feel that we are not following this Privacy Policy, you wish to be removed from a mailing list, or you have any questions about a Destination or the Services, you may contact us, in the case you are using a mobile app, via the Contact Us option on the drawer menu in the upper left corner of the screen or, in the case you are using a website, via the Contact Us page.
Effective Date
This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 15, 2019. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, effective immediately upon its posting. As we may make changes at any time without notifying you, we suggest that you periodically check this Destination or access this Privacy Policy through the Services. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of a Destination or the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy will indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
