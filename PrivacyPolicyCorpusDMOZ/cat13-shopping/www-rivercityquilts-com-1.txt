PRIVACY POLICY
River City Quilts respects our customers right to privacy online. We hold your detailed customer information in confidence.
CREDIT CARD SECURITY
We currently use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your information, including your credit card number, during online transactions. We believe SSL to be a very safe encryption method.
EMAIL SECURITY
For your protection, never put your credit card number or other sensitive information in unencrypted e-mail. When we send a confirmation email for your order, we will not include your credit card that you input when you ordered. In the extremely unlikely event that we ever do suspect a customer's credit card number has been intercepted, we will immediately notify the customer.
EMAIL SHARING
We will not share your email with 3rd parties. We only use your email for responses to website inquirys, online orders or our fabric notifiers.
COOKIES
River City Quilts currently uses cookies on our site. Our cookies tag each visitor's browser with a random, unique number. The cookie simply assigns a number and does not disclose any personal information about the person using the browser. We use cookies, so that when you come back to shop, your customer information will be remembered (minus your credit card information).
