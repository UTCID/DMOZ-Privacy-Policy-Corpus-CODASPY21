An important message from the Customer Service team
If you are contacting us today to track your order, please note that we are aware of some delays in the carrier network. This is due to the significant volume of orders our delivery partners are working hard to deliver on time. During these short delays, affecting just a small number of orders, you may not be able to track your order on the Royal Mail website. We are continuing to despatch all orders into the network on time and have every confidence that your order is on its way as planned. However, we do ask that you check your Arrive By date that can be found in the email Order Confirmation we sent you at the time you ordered, and at this time of unprecedented demand, kindly ask that you help support our delivery partners and allow an extra 2 working days after your Arrive By date for your order to arrive. We are currently experiencing a high volume of contacts from our customers right now to track their orders and you may wish to Contact Us only after you have allowed extra time for your order to arrive. Our current response time for answering messages sent via Contact Us is up to 5 working days.
If your enquiry is urgent please do not use the Contact Us form below but instead call 03444 932323 or message us via Facebook or Twitter.
