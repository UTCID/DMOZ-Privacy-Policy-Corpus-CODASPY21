BARGAINS AND SPECIAL OFFERS.
All bargains and special offers offered for sale on this site are covered by the same

and the free item. The second item ordered will be shown as free in the shopping basket.

not imply acceptance of your order nor form a contract.
The terms of our contract do not affect your statutory rights.

FOR DELIVERY ADDRESSES IN THE UK MAINLAND
(Excluding Scottish Highlands and certain areas)
The following charges apply;
Please See Shipping and Tax Info for smaller items.
Carrier guaranteed service for large items (rods, reels, waders, jackets, luggage,
downriggers, smokers, boat seats & other hardware) are charged from £6.99 per order.
Royal Mail Delivery is not a guaranteed service, please allow up to 10 working days for
packages to arrive. Larger items that do not fit through a letterbox can sometimes be held at
your local post office awaiting collection.
We cannot be held responsible for parcels that are lost in post due to an incorrect address
being supplied.
This excludes areas classed as Scottish Highlands, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland
and overseas.
This is subject to change at our discretion.
All prices include VAT at 20% except for books which do not carry VAT.
VAT FREE PRICES TO DELIVERY ADDRESSES IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS
If we are delivering to an address in the Channel Islands you don’t have to pay VAT at 20%
will be automatically deducted from the prices in your online shopping basket. For example -
Price in our catalogue is £6.50. £6.50 divided by 1.2 equals £5.42 The price you pay is £5.42.
The exception to this is books, which do not carry VAT in the first place, so for books only,
you pay the full price shown in our list.
DELIVERY ADDRESSES IN EU COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
The price you see is the price you pay, including VAT at 20%. A carriage charge applies to all
orders for small items regardless of total value. Usually your tackle will be sent by Royal
Mail Tracked or Non Tracked depending on which service is selected, which takes approximately
a week to arrive but you must allow up to 25 WORKING DAYS for your delivery to arrive.
Larger and heavier items, in particular rods, can be expensive to send. Most rods are too long
to go by normal postal services, and must be sent by carrier. If you want to order larger
items of tackle, we will contact you with a quote for the charge to send your order. You can
then decide whether you want to go ahead or not. All prices are in £ sterling.
Your credit card company will bill you in your own currency. Your credit card company can
advise you on the current rate of exchange.
You can pay by VISA, Mastercard.
DELIVERY ADDRESSES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UK AND EC, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA
We have many customers around the world, and we particularly enjoy welcoming fishermen and
women from the US and Canada. Our service is fast, friendly and easy to use.
The prices you see in our list include UK Value Added Tax which is currently 20%. (Except for
books, on which there is no tax.) YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THIS TAX. So if you divide our prices
by 1.2, you will reach the price you have to pay in £ sterling.
For example - Let's say the price in our catalogue is £6.50. £6.50 divided by 1.2 equals
£5.42. So the price you will pay is £5.42.
Your credit card company will bill you in your own currency. Your credit card company can
advise you of the current rate of exchange. Unfortunately, we are not able to advise you on
rates of exchange.
You can pay by VISA or Mastercard.
A carriage charge applies to all orders for small items regardless of total value. Usually
your tackle will be sent by Royal Mail Tracked or Non Tracked, depending on which service is
selected, which takes around a week to arrive but you must allow up to 25 WORKING DAYS for
your delivery to arrive.
Larger and heavier items, in particular rods, can be expensive to send. Most rods are too long
to go by normal postal services, and must be sent by carrier. If you want to order larger
items of tackle, we will contact you with a quote for the charge to send your order. You can
then decide whether you want to go ahead or not. Usually, it isn't economic for you to order
large items from us if you live outside the EC - the shipping costs are just too high - but we
are happy to do so if you'd like us to.
We are particularly happy to serve customers in the Middle East and the Commonwealth, and of
course, service personnel wherever they are stationed.
Any import duties and collection of goods from customs are the customers responsibility. We
will not be held responsible for loss of goods due to non payment of import duties or non
collection by the customer.
We usually dispatch within 24 hours of receiving your order.
