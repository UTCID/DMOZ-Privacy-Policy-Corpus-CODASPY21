Shipping and Handling Policy
...
Free Shipping for ALL USA ORDERS*  that total over $75.00  (including Alaska and Hawaii)
NOTE: If your order is less than $75.00 - You only pay $7 to ship your order no matter how many items you have on your order - What a great deal!
Note: We try to get all orders that we receive by 2pm EST (business days only) shipped out the same day. You will receive an email stating that your items were shipped and the tracking number. Note your order will be shipped by the carrier / method of our choice. Note: everything that can be purchased is in stock and ready to deliver.
Our most used shipping carrier for the USA is USPS. We also use FedEx Ground/Home Delivery. We utilize First Class Mail, Parcel Select, Priority and FedEx Home delivery. Some large or heavy orders, requiring oversized or special shipping boxes, will be shipped by the carrier of our choice. During the Christmas season we try to ship everything the fastest way. If you have questions about our shipping policy, please contact us.
Please note, orders that include MATCHES must be shipped by Ground Delivery. If you ordered matches along with other items, the order may be shipped in a single box by Ground Delivery.
Express mail is available. Just write a note in the comments box when placing your order. We will email you back an Express Shipping Cost Quote - if this is acceptable to you, then we will charge the express cost to your credit card, just let us know. Also note, Express Shipping is not refundable, even if the package is not delivered on time or the package is lost in transit or is received damaged. FYI: For average orders Express Shipping will cost between $30 and $75.
For all orders to Canada your shipping cost is $42.00 to ship your order no matter how many items you have on your order. Our system doesn't allow us to figure the actual shipping cost to Canada, please note if our cost is less than the $42, we will refund you the extra cost. Again - If the shipping cost is less than $42 (usually if we ship First Class), then we will refund the difference (min s&h is $7).
Our shipping fee does not include any duty or custom fees you may be required to pay, those fees are out of our control.
Our most used shipping carrier-method for Canada is Air Mail Parcel Post, this means you should receive your package within 8-16 business days after we ship.

Shipping Internationally will cost $42.50 per order. Our shipping fee does not include any duty or custom fees you may be required to pay, those fees are out of our control. We reserve the right to change this shipping cost as needed. We reserve the right to charge a special handling fee for orders of multiple boxes of candles. If the shipping cost that we charge on your order is more than listed on your order when you placed it, we will contact you with the updated shipping cost before processing your order. If the shipping cost is less than $42.50, we may decide to charge the actual cost plus a handling fee.

All international Orders are shipped at buyer's risk, and we usually ship by USPS Air Mail Priority International.
Note: We ship all packages with all paperwork and customs forms. We work hard to insure a safe delivery, but we cannot control what happens outside of the US. We have had very good success with no lost or damaged packages to date.
* WHOLESALE ORDERS: Please note for all wholesale orders we charge the actual shipping charges. We will contact you after we pack your order with the shipping cost you will be charged.
Return Policy

We will require you to pack the item into a shipping box.  We will send you a shipping label.  Please be sure you pack the item so that it does not become more damaged.
All defective merchandise is subject to inspection to determine if the issue is a result of a manufacturer's defect, normal wear and tear, or misuse.
We do not consider a color variation to be a product defect. Computer monitors display colors differently; no two screens are exactly alike. If you are unsure about a color, email us for more information before you order
The Details
Our 30 day return policy starts from the date your item was delivered.  The item must be back in our possession within 30 days from then.
Returned items must be NEW and UNUSED condition with ALL ORIGINAL PACKAGING.
When you return your shipment, make sure to INSURE your return for LOSS and DAMAGE! Damage that occurs during the return shipment is the responsibility of the customer.
Please Note: If you burn candles in your Pyramid; it is used.
Please Note: If you burn incense in your Smoker; it is used.
Lightbulbs must be returned UNOPENED.  Sorry, but no credit will be given for opened packs.
If you received free or discounted shipping (i.e. your original order was more than $75), your refund will be reduced by the actual shipping charge that USPS or FedEx charged us to send your original order.
Example 1: if you purchased $100 in merchandise and want to return it and you selected FREE SHIPPING, lets say FedEx charged us $10 to ship your original order, you will receive a refund of $90. NOT $100.
Example 2: if you purchased $100 in merchandise and you chose to pay and additional fee for 2-5 day shipping, which added $5.20 to your total.  Now you want to return your order.  Lets say FedEx charged us $15.20 to ship your order, you will receive a refund of $90 ($100 [merchandise] + $5.20 [additional fee] - $15.20 [our actual freight bill] = $90). NOT $105.20.
Our return process is not automated; please keep in mind that we are in the Eastern time zone and will respond during our business hours
If you have any problems using the items you buy from ChristKindl-Markt, email us!

Under no circumstances will we give out any information you give us to a third party. That includes your email address, your name, address or credit card information. No individual information is provided to any third-party without your consent.
Email List Policy:
We only send our Email Newsletter to those who ask for it on this site. If at any time you would like to stop receiving the newsletter, you can unsubscribe by going to the newsletter link and following the instructions there or by going to the link in the newsletter - follow the unsubscribe link or contact us and we'll unsubscribe you.
To report any abuse or violations of this Email List Privacy Policy, please send us an email (see below for email address) and attach an unedited copy of the email message that you feel was sent to you in error or without your permission. Include all header information so that we can trace origin of the message and any notes or other information that you feel are pertinent.
