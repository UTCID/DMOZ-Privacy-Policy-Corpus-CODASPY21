Why don’t you offer free shipping?
Our shipping rates are calculated directly from UPS or the Postal Service based on your package's weight and the distance of delivering it, plus a small handling fee. We have maintained the lowest possible prices for our products and continue to lower our prices whenever we can, but rather than subsidizing the cost of the shipping within our product pricing and offering free or reduced shipping rates, we opt for a more transparent pricing system.
How long do processing and shipping take?
Generally packages leave our facility within a couple of days; occasionally we may be a little behind due to a holiday or order rush. From start to finish your order is processed, filled, and shipped by human beings! For the highest quality and freshness, all of our products are hand-poured and filled to order, rather than pre-bagged. We pride ourselves on this personal touch to ensure every package is perfect. For additional information regarding our shipping policies please visit our shipping page.
Can I add to my order after it’s placed?
Because our payment processing center pre-authorizes your credit card for the total amount of your order, we are unfortunately unable to make changes. Due to ecommerce regulations and for our customers' protection, we are not able to charge more than your original pre-authorization. Adding to or changing the order is not possible without voiding the pre-authorization or canceling and refunding the original order.
My order has not shipped yet, can I cancel it?
Because we process your order as quickly as possible, we can only accept order cancellations by 3 PM Pacific Time the day the order is placed. Requests for order cancellations received after this time will not be accepted.
When will my pickup order be ready, and where can I pick it up?
We process and package your pickup order by hand and doublecheck it for accuracy before we send it down to our retail location for pickup. This extra attention to detail means that we need a little extra time to prepare your order.
All orders placed by 2:00 pm will require two business days to be filled; in other words, an order placed before 2:00 pm on a Monday would be ready for pickup after 2:00 pm on Wednesday, and so forth. (Weekends and holidays when the Mercantile does not receive deliveries would not be counted as business days.)
Pickup orders are available at our Mountain Rose Herbs Mercantile location. The Mountain Rose Herbs Mercantile's hours of operation are 10:00 am to 6:00 pm Pacific Time Monday through Saturday and 10:00 am to 5:00 pm on Sunday. The address of our mercantile store is 152 W. 5th Ave., Eugene, OR. You can give us a call at (541) 868-8420 or (800) 879-3337 to check on the status of your order before stopping by.
How do I purchase/apply a gift certificate?
Exciting news! We have implemented NEW gift certificates and you may purchase them HERE. They are all electronic and are emailed to the recipient as soon as we process the order.  You can redeem your gift certificate online by entering the gift certificate code from the email attachment you received in the “Add Certificate” section of the web cart. Once you hit “Apply” the amount of the gift certificate will be automatically deducted from your grand total.
If you have one of our old paper gift certificates, the redemption process is different from the above steps and you need to follow these instructions instead, please.  You are welcome to enter the number listed on the paper notecard into the Order Comments box on the Delivery Method page. We will then apply this credit manually in our office as we process your order. Because we must apply these gift certificate manually, its value will not immediately be subtracted from the total of your purchase in the web cart. If the value of your gift certificate is greater than or equal to the total amount of your order (with shipping included), simply select “check” as your method of payment. If a balance remains on your order after using your paper gift certificate, you may pay the rest by credit card. Simply fill out your billing information as normal, and we will deduct the value of the gift certificate from your order and use the provided card number to pay the rest of the balance.
If you need any assistance with redeeming a paper gift certificate or an electronic gift certificate code, please contact us!  We can be reached at 1-800-879-3337, Monday through Friday, from 8am to 4pm PST.
Do you ship internationally?
At this time, Mountain Rose Herbs is only processing and shipping orders with billing and final destination shipping addresses located in the United States and Canada. We are not able to bill or ship to any countries outside of these two destinations. If you have specific questions regarding our Canadian processing department, please visit our Canadian orders page.
Are all of your products organic?
We strive to sell organic products whenever possible. If a product is not organic, it is cultivated without chemicals, or wild harvested. Our 10 full-time lab staffers are constantly testing our ingredients to ensure they meet our strict specifications and are free from adulterants and contamination, including pesticides. You may always request a certificate of analysis, organic certificate, and kosher certificate. Please see our certifications page for more details on the additional documents we can provide for you.
Are your essential oils therapeutic grade? Can they be ingested?
The essential oils offered by Mountain Rose Herbs are 100% pure essential oils. Our essential oil line is suitable for aromatherapy, cosmetics, and for the production of body care products. Due to regulatory concerns, we are unable to recommend them for internal use. Pure essential oils such as ours are extremely concentrated and many of them are dangerous if ingested.
How are your products packaged?
Our product packaging is designed to protect the high-quality botanicals inside. We use a variety of materials including glass, plastic, multi-layer bags, recyclable tin, and boxes to keep the botanical goodness inside fresh. In addition, we pride ourselves on making sure we use green materials to package and pad our boxes to ensure your order arrives safe and sound.
Can I return a product? What if I received the wrong item or my order was damaged?
Our guarantee to you is that if for ANY reason you wish to return the products that you have received, you may send them back to us postmarked within 30 days from the date your order is received. If you have received the wrong item or damage occurs, please contact us at (800) 879-3337, extension 109, or email us at support@mountainroseherbs.com. For additional information please visit our returns page.
There was an error message when I tried to check out, what now?
If you are experiencing an issue while entering your payment information, the billing address you entered might not match the address of the card being used. Our payment system requires that the billing address provided matches the card for our customers’ protection—this is a feature of the AVS verification system that Mountain Rose Herbs and many online companies use. Please contact your bank to ensure your billing address is correct or if there are any other issues that may cause the payment to be rejected.
If you are experiencing errors when attempting to ship via USPS, please note that some of our products, including certain essential oils and extracts, cannot be shipped through the post office. If you are a Canadian customer experiencing an error while checking out, please visit our Canadian orders page.
Where is my tracking information?
Most orders take up to 2-3 business days to leave our facility after being hand-poured, scooped, and packaged with care. Rest assured, we will automatically send you an email with your tracking details and an estimated arrival date! If you have any questions about the status of your order, don’t hesitate to call our customer service team at (800) 879-3337.
Why does it take so long for an item to come back in stock?
We prefer to let our shelves sit empty rather than sell our customers inferior stock. While it would be easy to purchase lesser quality botanicals, we are committed to bringing you only the best. Our growers are regularly impacted by unpredictability due to weather, crop success, and even international crises including conflict. When items do arrive at our facility, they are subject to our rigorous quality control process in order to make sure we only provide the best herbal products to our customers.
We recommend signing up for a Back in Stock email notification on the website. If some or all sizes of a product you’re searching for are out of stock, you will see a gray “Notify when in stock” button. Click this, and you will be able to sign up for an automatic email notification upon restocking. You can keep track of and manage your notifications by using your online account.
Does Mountain Rose Herbs sell on Amazon.com?
In order to guarantee the quality of our products and keep our prices low, we never sell on internet marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, or eBay. If you see our products listed on those marketplaces, they are being sold by a third party, and we have no way of guaranteeing their quality. Please note that products bought from third parties must be returned through those channels and are not returnable to us.
Why do I have sales tax added to my order?
Mountain Rose Herbs charges sales tax in accordance with multiple and ever-changing state laws. If you have questions about how that works, please see our legal disclosures page.
