Online Pricing and Offers
A guide to the discounts and deals we offer online, plus how to save even more…

How Can I Find Out What Offers are Available?
Are Your Online Prices the Same as in Stores?
No - There are different overheads with a web business, so we're able to offer different prices from WHSmith stores. Prices you see online are only valid on the website, not in our stores.
We do sometimes take part in the same promotions as WHSmith stores, but that doesn't mean our prices will be the same

How Do You Price Products Online?
We offer competitive prices and promotions across our ranges. All prices are shown inclusive of VAT.
Discounts
Lots of our products are discounted and these discounts are shown on the site as follows:
Books: discounted against the RRP (Recommended Retail Price)
Other products: discounted against the previous selling price
Multi-buy offers: With a multi-buy offer such as "Buy One Get One Free" or "3 For 2", the lowest-priced item is discounted or free.
The discount will show in your shopping basket automatically once you’ve added enough qualifying items to your basket. If you don't select enough items to qualify for the offer, you'll pay the normal price. Multi-buy offers are subject to availability.
In your basket and confirmation email we display the items at their full price, and the multi-buy discount as a discount against the basket. If we dispatch the items separately we discount each item by a proportion of the multi-buy saving. For instance; buy two £10 products on a Buy One Get One Free - if we dispatch these separately the £10 discount will be apportioned as a £5 discount off each product.

What Happens if the Price Changes After I Order?
You'll be charged the price stated when you placed your order, even if the price of the item goes up.

How Do I Get to Know What Offers are Available?
Our best offers are always on our Special Offers page. On the product's page you'll see the product's price and whether it is included in a multi-buy offer.
