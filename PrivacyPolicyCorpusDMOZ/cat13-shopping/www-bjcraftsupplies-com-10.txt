COUNT OF BEADS PER INCH
To use this chart simply multiply the number of pieces that correspond to the bead size you will be using and multiply that by the length of your bead string. For example, to do an 18" strand of 6mm beads you would need 80 beads (18 x 4.24)

SEED BEAD INFORMATION AND SIZING
Seed beads are sized using expressions such as 6/0 and 10/0. Generally, the smaller the number on the left, the larger the seed bead. Some beads are sold in hanks, which is measured a little different than yarns and other textile goods. A hank of beads is 12 strands of seed beads, folded in half and tied off. Some seed beads vary in size, color or shape from batch to batch. This variation can give your finished piece a special look of it's own. However, if you want your finished piece to be more consistent or uniform you will want to use Japanese seed beads, such as Toho beads or Miyuki Delica beads, which are the industry standard, usually sold by weight stated in grams.
The most popular thread for seed beading projects is a nylon monofilament thread, like Nymo.
Like seed beads, for needle sizes, the bigger the number, the finer the needle.

THREAD SIZING GUIDE
Deciding what type of cord or thread can be a challenge. As a general guide, if your beads are a soft material bead such as pearls or amber then a silk, polyester or nylon thread will do. If your beads are a hard material such
glass or stone then you might want to use a polyester or nylon beading thread. For metal beads, large beads, rough texture beads or large holed beads you might want to use a strong thread like
Tiger Tail™.
