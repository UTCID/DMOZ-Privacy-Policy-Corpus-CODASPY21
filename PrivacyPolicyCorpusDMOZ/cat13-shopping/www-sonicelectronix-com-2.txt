Litigation & Jurisdiction
Any disputes and conflicts arising from these terms of use or involved with a sales transaction on SonicElectronix.com will be governed by the laws of the State of California. For non-Small Claims matters, the venue shall be Los Angeles County, California. The Superior Court of Los Angeles will serve as the sole jurisdiction in regards to resolving any non-Small Claims disputes between SonicElectronix.com and a customer, and the parties consent to relinquish all rights to pursue non-Small Claims litigation outside of the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the aforementioned State Courts. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable legal fees and costs.

In addition, customers shall assume any costs related to servicing, repair and correction of a misused product.
Typographical/Photographical Errors
SonicElectronix.com is not responsible for typographical and/or photographical errors. SonicElectronix reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for any reason, including but not limited to typographical and/or photographical errors.  Prices, specifications and images are subject to change without notice.
Product Updates
Though unusual in nature, product information displayed on SonicElectronix.com may become outdated without prior notice due to unanticipated changes brought on by the manufacturer. In an effort to serve our customers we strive to keep up to date with any revisions, however, as a reseller we depend on manufacturers for updates in regards to any alterations, as such, we are not responsible for any variations in product specifications. We may experience a lag in discovering and/or publishing such changes. This may include, but it is not limited to, new editions of otherwise identical models, revised specifications, variations in color or appearance, changes in a product’s packaging materials and contents, or any other changes brought on by the original manufacturer.
Rights of Refusal
SonicElectronix reserves the right to refuse service, including but not limited to, order fulfillment, customer support, and technical support, for any reason. A SonicElectronix order invoice does not represent an actual acceptance of an order nor does it represent an offer to sell, rather, we reserve the right to decline an order for any reason, even after an order invoice is issued.
Sales Taxes
All orders shipped within California or Kentucky will be charged with the state sales tax. The current California sales tax rate is 9.25%. The current Kentucky sales tax rate is 6.00%. Customers ordering items to be shipped outside of California or Kentucky are responsible for all sales taxes and duties as assessed by their respective legislative authorities.
Shipping Risks
SonicElectronix.com will provide customers with tracking information including expected shipping dates, but SonicElectronix.com will not be held responsible for any delays, damages or losses due to (but not limited to) natural disasters, acts of federal, state or local government, fires, floods, strikes, lockouts, freight embargoes, and acts of God. Customers can pursue claims for lost and damaged packages through the shipping courier. As a courtesy to our customers, we assist you in pursuing a claim with the shipping courier in regards to lost or damaged packages. Pursuing a claim does not guarantee or imply a favorable outcome for the customer, as the shipping courier investigates and judges each claim on a case by case basis.
User Submissions
User content submitted to this website may be disseminated by SonicElectronix for any purpose except for as outlined in the Privacy Policy. All personal data will be handled with discretion as outlined in our Privacy Policy. Users are strictly prohibited from submitting any material containing offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic or profane material; violators will be held responsible and may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
Any ideas or suggestions submitted to this website are considered non-proprietary, and users responsible for submitting such material waive their rights to seek compensation when providing such material, unsolicited or otherwise.
Severability
In the case that any stipulation of this agreement is deemed invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, whether as a whole or in part, such incongruence shall not affect the validity of the remaining stipulations outlined in this agreement. If any specific provision in this agreement is deemed invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, it will be modified in a way that best retains the original meaning while following California law with respect to validity and enforceability.
Terms of Use Revisions
SonicElectronix reserves the right to update our Terms of Use. As a user of this site you implicitly consent to any updates in our Terms of Use. Return to this page as often as it pertains to your concern.
