RETURN POLICY
Part of the magic of FastPencil is that we can produce books on demand, so you don’t have to order more books than you need. A side effect of this lean production method is that we cannot cancel orders, accept returns, or provide refunds for the books you publish through FastPencil.
We recommend that you carefully check your order for accuracy before confirming your purchase. Make sure everything looks the way you want it to look. Think carefully about the number of books you want produced. Select the shipping option that best meets your needs.
Because we are providing you access to a creator-controlled publishing tool, we cannot accept responsibility for the quality of the content (including misspelled words, grammatical errors, etc.), its formatting, design or overall appearance. We do not monitor or check content, other than through our Author Services. Even if you have used our Author Services to assist you, ultimate responsibility for the quality of content is yours.
If you receive printed or electronic products from us that are damaged in some way (missing, torn, or loose pages, etc.), we are happy to provide a replacement copy. Simply contact us at support@fastpencil.com
