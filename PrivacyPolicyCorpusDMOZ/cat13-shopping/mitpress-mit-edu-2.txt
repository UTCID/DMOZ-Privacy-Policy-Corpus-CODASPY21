If no specific restrictions are displayed, Users may make copies of select portions of the Content, provided that the copies are made only for User's personal use and that User maintains any notices contained in the Content, such as all copyright notices, trademark legends, or other proprietary rights notices. Except as provided in the preceding sentences or as permitted by the fair use privilege under the U.S. copyright laws (see e.g., 17 U.S.C. Section 107), Users may not upload, post, reproduce, or distribute in any way Content protected by copyright, or other proprietary right, without obtaining permission of the owner of the copyright or other propriety right.

If the MIT Press is notified of allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive Content provided by Users (e.g., through a forum posting or online review), the Press may investigate the allegation and determine in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such Content from the MIT Press Web site. The MIT Press may disclose any Content or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate the MIT Press; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of MIT, the MIT Press, its Users or Providers.
The MIT Press reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content that it deems in its sole discretion to be harmful to individual Users, the MIT Press, MIT as a whole or in part, or any rights of the MIT Press or any third party, or to violate any applicable law.
