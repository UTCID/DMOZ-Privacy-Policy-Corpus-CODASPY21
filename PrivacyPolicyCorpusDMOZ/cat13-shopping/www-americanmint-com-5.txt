The United States Dollar remains a strong currency today and is one of the primary currencies used in most international transactions. U.S. currency is also popular with collectors who determine the value of a piece based on its condition, rarity, demand, and mintage. While many numismatists focus on collecting coins that have been in circulation, others may seek out scarcer, uncirculated pieces to add to their collection.
Uncirculated coins fit one of three categories — they've been released to the public but are not intended for general circulation, they've undergone a special minting process that produces a smooth, satin-like finish, or they've been graded as "Mint State 60+" on the Sheldon Grading Scale, meaning they're close to or in the same condition as their original minting.
American Mint: Your One-Stop Headquarters for Uncirculated Currency
If you're one of the many collectors who love to find rare, uncirculated money, you've come to the right place. American Mint offers a selection of uncirculated U.S. currency to bring unique value to your home collection today. Our inventory includes a variety of beautiful silver and gold coins such as:
2009 Abraham Lincoln Silver Dollar: Minted in solid .900 pure silver, this genuine silver dollar commemorates the 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. The U.S. Mint produced only 500,000 of these extraordinary coins, but American Mint has been able to obtain a limited supply for our customers.
1986 $5 Statue of Liberty Coin: The U.S. Mint issued this coin (the first $5 gold coin it ever minted) to celebrate the 100th birthday of "Lady Liberty." This beautiful piece consists of .900 pure gold. As with the Lincoln Silver Dollar, this coin was limited to 500,000 pieces. By law, it can never be produced again.
World War II D-Day 50th Anniversary Dollar:This 90-percent pure silver coin was issued in 1993 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Normandy Invasion, which paved the way for the Allied victory in World War II. The obverse features a striking image of a U.S. soldier bravely storming the beach. The U.S. Mint limited the production of this uncirculated currency to only 107,240 pieces.
