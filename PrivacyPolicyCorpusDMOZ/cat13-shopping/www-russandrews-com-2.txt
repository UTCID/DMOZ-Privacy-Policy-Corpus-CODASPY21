Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. As always our policy is not to disclose customer information to any third parties (except as explained in sections 1 and 3 below), so you won't get 'junk mail' as a result of being on our mailing list.
If you want to know about how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy, then read on.
1. The information we collect and how we use it
When you register/place an order we need to know your name, postal address, delivery address (if different), e-mail address and telephone number. When placing an order you will be asked to provide credit or debit card information. These payment details will be protected by encryption and for optimal security are only retained temporarily.
We gather this information to allow us to process your registration and process any orders you may place. The relevant information is then used by us to communicate with you on any matters relating to your order and the provision of goods and services in general.
We would like to provide you with information about special offers, product and service promotions we think may be of interest to you and special features of our website. If you would rather not receive this information, please indicate this preference in 'My Account' on this website (if you have registered). Alternatively, to remove yourself from our e-mail list send an email with your name to info@russandrewsusa.com, and to remove yourself from our postal list send an e-mail with your name and address (or customer number) to info@russandrewsusa.com.
We do not provide your information to any third parties except:

To monitor and improve the goods or services we provide, from time to time we may provide your information to our customer services agencies for research and analysis purposes. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our goods or services. We completely understand that you may not wish to give us feedback.
2. How we protect your information
The internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place security procedures to encrypt sensitive information using SSL security.
We also keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of Russ Andrews USA Inc cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.
3. Sale of business
If this business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.

If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. We will also e-mail you should we make any changes so that you may consent to our use of your information in that way. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.
