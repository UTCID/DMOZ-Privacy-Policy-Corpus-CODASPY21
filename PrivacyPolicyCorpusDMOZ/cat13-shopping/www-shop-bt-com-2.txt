How do I obtain a copy invoice/receipt? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How to obtain a copy of your e-Receipt.
How to obtain a VAT invoice instead of an e-Receipt.
In brief...
When we ship an order we do not produce a VAT invoice as a general rule. Instead, we send an electronic receipt or "e-Receipt" as we call it. This is because BT Shop is a website for individual customers and not businesses.
If you have bought from BT Shop and need a VAT invoice instead of an e-receipt, don't worry, we can arrange this for you. Please contact us using the link below under "Need Further Assistance". Please have your order number ready to quote.
Please note that e-Receipts and invoices are available for fully delivered orders only and not "part shipped" orders.
Further information...
To obtain a copy of your e-Receipt, please click here to go to 'My Account' (you'll find a link at the top of this page too), then choose the 'view orders & returns' option. Use the drop down menu to help you find the relevant order then click the 'view order' button. The details of your order will be presented. To request a copy of your e-Receipt, scroll to the bottom of your order and click the 'request e-receipt' button. Your e-Receipt will be sent by email to your registered account email address shortly after.
**Please note that due to migration to a new computer system on 26th/27th February, you'll only be able to access orders, and therefore request an e-receipt, for orders placed from 1st Jan 2011. To request an e-receipt for orders older than this, please email your request to shop@bt.com**
Unfortunately, you cannot request a VAT invoice from 'my account'. Instead, please contact us using the link below. (top tip: be ready to quote the relevant order number when you contact us).
We cannot change any of the information on the invoice/receipt.

What do I do if I've forgotten my password? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How to be reminded of your password.
In brief...
To be reminded of your password simply follows these easy steps:
Click the 'My Account/login' option in the top of our homepage.
At the login page, click the text below the sign in button that reads 'Forgotten Password?'
You will then be asked for your email address.
This will trigger a request to us and we'll send your password to your registered email address.
Further information...
Please note that this is the only way that we'll resend customers their passwords, because it's secure. To send out customer passwords via any other means, or via any other route, wouldn't be secure and therefore is not something that we'll do.
If you have repeatedly attempted to log in to your account, your account may have been blocked (for security reasons) therefore if you log in after receiving your reminder still does not work, please allow 24 hours to attempt again.

Important information about phishing email messages and viruses +
The term "phishing" relates to email scams where unsolicited messages are sent by illegitimate senders, usually posing as a recognised brand or organisation.
These emails may attempt to trick you into disclosing personal or financial information. Sometimes the email may contain a virus hidden within an attachment, which if opened, could be harmful to your computer.
If you receive an email from BT that you weren't expecting, or you're suspicious about its contents, then:
Don't click on it or open any attachments
You can also forward the suspicious email to abuse@bt.com
You can find more useful information and advice at www.bt.com/safety.

Further information...
To log into your account, click the "my account/log in" link at the top of our home page. On the next page you'll need to enter your email address and password.
As you'll see, you can also change other details in that section, such as payment methods and your communication preferences. It's your responsibility to keep your details updated on our website.

Further information...
When you set up your account you would have added your nominated credit card details.

You can have several cards stored on your account, so you can choose which one to use each time you order from our website.
To log into your account, click the "my account/log in" link at the top of our home page. Once you're logged into your account, go to the section headed "Manage payment methods". You'll see your credit card details listed and the option to edit an existing card, remove it, or add a new one.
The card details you'll see are in a secure area, and for extra security they will be partly hidden.

How do I remove myself from your mailing lists? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How you can remove yourself from our mailing lists.
How you can change your communication preferences and subscribe or unsubscribe to special offer newsletters.
In brief...
We like to keep our customers informed about special offers and special pricing, so from time to time we send out various communications by post or email.
When you first became a customer and logged onto our website, we asked you about "Marketing Communication" preferences. We asked you then if you'd like to receive special offers, so anything you receive is in line with your preferences.
Further information...
There are several ways you can stop subscribing to these special offers. The best way is to log on to your account - to do this click the "my Account/login" link at the top right of our web site. Once you are logged on, click "Edit communication preferences" under "Other Options" at the bottom of the page.
You will see your current preferences listed and can change what you like. Don't forget to click the "SAVE CHANGES" button when you have made the changes!!
Other ways to Un-Subscribe
At the bottom of every marketing email we send there's a link which you can click to un subscribe. Our lists are prepared several days in advance, so the change may take a while to come into effect.
We also post our catalogues regularly to existing and prospective customers. If you've received a catalogue and want to be removed form the list, please check the wrapping and obtain the 11 character reference printed on it, and follow the steps below:
If the reference starts with a "3", click this link and enter the information requested.
If the reference does not start with "3", please click here to email our marketing department to request removal. Please quote the reference number in the email. We will then remove you from our mailing list.

How Can I Apply for a BT Employee, Contractor or Pensioner Discount? +
If you are a BT employee, a BT contractor or a member of the extended workforce with an EIN number or you are a BT Pensioner with a Pensioner Identification Number (PIN) you are eligible to join the BT People Discount Scheme. Join today and start saving on over 20,000 products. Please note, if you've joined BT, EE or Plusnet since April 2017 you may be unable to enrol to the scheme online, we are working on that problem to resolve by September 2017. To still benefit from savings simply call 0800 917 0510 and speak to the BT Shop team to confirm the employee price and place an order offline.
Applying to the join the BT People Discount Scheme is easy. Please note that you must have a standard BT Shop account in order to register for your employee discount.
STEP 1: Follow this link to go to the log in area of BT Shop. If you already have a BT Shop account please log into it using your usual BT Shop log in. If you do not currently have a log in please create a new account by clicking the 'home user' button.
STEP 2: Upon registration/log in you will be redirected to the area of your account where we need you to register your BT EIN/PIN and email address. Please note that the system needs you to enter your details exactly as they appear on your official BT record - i.e. Robert Smith, not Bob Smith.
STEP 3: You'll receive an email once your BT People Discount Scheme status has been authenticated (usually well within 24 hours)
STEP 4: As soon as your status is set to 'completed' your specially discounted prices will automatically be displayed whenever you are logged in.
Important Note: Even when you are a member of the BT People Discount Scheme you need to continue to log in to your BT Shop account using your BT Shop login details and NOT your main BT work login details or EIN/PIN.
Special note for BT Employees and Pensioners based outside of the UK: Provided you choose a delivery address for your goods within the UK AND you pay with a credit card where the registered address is also in the UK, then you can enjoy our BT People Discount Scheme.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Who is eligible?
If you are a BT employee, a BT contractor or a member of the extended workforce with an EIN number or you are a BT Pensioner with a Pensioner Identification Number (PIN) you are eligible to join the BT People Discount Scheme on the BT Shop.
What will I get?
The BT People Discount Scheme offers you up to 25% discount against the retail recommended price on BT branded products and a variable discount on our third party non-BT products. (Exclusions apply*). Where we are unable to offer a 25% discount*, we will make sure that you benefit from the best available price. We will price match the product to the RRP on the standard BT Shop and dabs.com; that way as a valued member of the BT People community you will always get the best available price. Please note that you will always be given the best discount available, so if a product is on promotion with more than 25% discount your price will automatically be amended to show the lowest possible price.
What do I need to do?
All you need to do is set up an account on the BT Shop and then register as a BT employee as described in the step by step instructions above. If you had a BT People Shop account, a standard BT Shop account or had already registered with the dabs.com employee purchase program prior to July 2nd 2007 you will need to re-register in order to take advantage of these benefits.
How does it work?
As soon as you have signed up to the BT People Discount Scheme and the status has been set to 'completed' you will be eligible for the specially discounted prices. Please note that you will need to ensure that you are logged into your account to view your employee discount price. Please note that the RRP price will not be displayed and the price that you see will be the price that you pay. However your basket will display the amount of money that you have saved as a BT employee. On future visits all you need to do is log into your account and start shopping!
What do I do if I am on the BT Shop but can't see the discounted prices?
If you are on the BT Shop and logged into your BT Shop discount account, the discounted price that you are entitled to will automatically be displayed. Please note that the standard price will not be displayed but you can view your saving in the basket on the right hand side of the site. If you cannot view the discounted prices please make sure that you are registered for the Discount Scheme by checking under "Your Account". If you haven't registered yet for your BT People discount you will need to register using your EIN or PIN number and email address. Please note that if you have applied for the discount scheme but your status is set to 'pending' you will not be shown the discounted prices. These will only be visible once your application is set to 'completed'.
What about if I already have a dabs.com employee purchase account?
As you will be aware, dabs.com is part of the BT Group. The Employee discount scheme run by dabs.com offers exactly the same discount and benefits as the discounts on BT Shop. Your dabs.com employee account will remain open and you may continue to use this account should you prefer.
I already have a standard BT Shop account. Can I upgrade this to an employee or pensioner account?
If the account was set up before July 2nd 2007 then we are afraid that you will need to re-register. However, if you set your account up on or after July 2nd 2007 you can upgrade this to include your BT People discount. Please follow the step by step guide above.
Can I have 2 accounts on the BT Online Shop? One as a normal consumer customer, without a discount and one for the BT People Discount Scheme?
Yes. You can have as many BT Shop accounts as you like as long as you register with different e-mail addresses. However, you can only have one of these accounts registered under the BT People Discount Scheme. However you shouldn't need more than one account as we guarantee that you won't be able to buy anything cheaper on the standard BT Online Shop.
What happens if I accidentally place the order on the standard Shop because I have used the wrong email address/log in, will you refund me the discount?
No. It is your responsibility to purchase using the correct account. Please make sure you are purchasing under your BT People Discount Scheme account before you complete the transaction.
Can I order by Phone?
Sorry no. In order to give the discounts that we do we have had to make this a web only offer.

How to log into your account.
What happens if you make a mistake with your password when you try to log in.
How to get your password if you've forgotten it.
In brief...
If you want to place an order with us, you'll need to create an account on our website. Your details will be stored so you won't have to re-enter them all again next time you place an order.
To set up an account, we need a valid email address and you'll need to think of a memorable password which is at least 6 characters long.
Your details will be kept private in line with your preferences, which we'll ask you about when you create the account. Click here to read our privacy policy for further information.
Further information...

If you've shopped with us before and have an account already, please log in when prompted.
When logging in, should you type your password incorrectly 3 times, then for security reasons your account will be automatically locked for 24 hours. After 24 hours, it will be unlocked. If you still can't remember your password by this time, you'll need to request a reminder.
To be reminded of your password, click the "Log in/My Account" link at the top of the screen. Then click "forgotten password" and we'll email it to you. For security reasons, this is the only way we can get your password to you.
Please note that the BT Shop was relaunched on July 2nd 2007 so if you opened your account prior to this date you will need to re-register. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience that this may cause but the new Shop is based on a different technology platform so we are unable to migrate your account.
You may use the same email address and password to open a new account if you wish and it will only take you a few moments of your time.
To open a new account please follow the steps below.
Step 1: Visit the My Account area
Step 2: Click "Home User" under the new customer section
Step 3: Complete your details as requested and your new account will be set up and ready to use.

Forgotten your account number? Please go to the Lloyds-TSB Registrars Shareview website at https://www.shareview.co.uk/asp/forgot.asp
If you are a BT e-shareholder based outside of the UK you can still place an order providing that you pay with a credit/debit card registered to a UK address and have your goods delivered to a UK address.
If you are a shareholder and you do not wish to sign up to the BT e-shareholder scheme, you can still buy from the BT Shop and you will be able to benefit from some great discounts as a part of the May AGM and September and February dividend mailings.
What will I get?
The BT e-shareholder discount scheme offers you up to 20% discount against the retail recommended price on BT branded products and a variable discount on our third party non-BT products (exclusions apply*). Where we are unable to offer a 20% discount*, we will make sure that you benefit from the best available price. We will price match the product to the RRP on the standard BT Shop, that way as a valued BT e-shareholder you will always get the best available price.
What do I need to do?
All you need to do is set up an account on the BT Shop and register as a BT e-shareholder as described in the step by step instructions. If you had a BT Shop account prior to July 2nd 2007 you will need to re-register in order to take advantage of these benefits. You can if you wish use the same email address and password but as the new site is using different technology we will need to take your details from you again as your old account will no longer be valid. However, it is a very simple process and we are sure that once you see the extended range of offers you'll realise it's worth it! You can view full details on setting up an account here. Please note that if you have only recently registered as a BT e-Shareholder you will need to wait until you receive your confirmation letter from the registrar before you try to open an e-shareholder account on the BT Shop.
How does it work?
As soon as you have signed up to the BT e-shareholder discount scheme and have logged into your account you will automatically be shown your special e-shareholder discounted price. Please note that the RRP price will not be displayed and the price that you see will be the price that you pay. However your basket will display the amount of money that you have saved as a BT e-shareholder. On future visits all you need to do is visit www.bt.com/shop/eshareholder log into your account and start shopping!
Why has the BT Shop been relaunched?
We are continually looking to provide new and better benefits for our shareholders and as a result we are now able to offer you a year round discount on both BT products and on the full range of products previously offered by our sister company, dabs.com. The new BT Shop also now employs different technology and a fresh new design making it even easier to use and find the products that you're looking for.
I already have a BT Shop account. Why do I need to re-register?
If you had a BT Shop account prior to July 2nd 2007 we will need you to reregister. Unfortunately because we are now using a different (but much better!) technology platform we were unable to copy over your old BT Shop account. However, it is a very simple process to set up a new account and well worth the few minutes it takes. Please see the step by step instructions above.
Can I have 2 accounts on the BT Online Shop? One as a normal consumer customer, without a discount and one for the BT e-shareholder discount scheme?
Yes. You can have as many BT Shop accounts as you like as long as you register with different e-mail addresses (we recommend you make a note of which email address applies to which account). However, you can only have one of these accounts registered under the BT e-shareholder discount scheme. If you are logged in under the BT e-shareholder discount scheme and want to visit the standard BT Online Shop to view products at their standard pricing - you will need to sign out and then login with your alternative email address and vice versa. You shouldn't need more than one account as we guarantee that you won't be able to buy anything cheaper on the standard BT Online Shop.
What happens if I accidentally place the order on the standard Shop because I have used the wrong email address/log in, will you refund me the discount?
No. It is your responsibility to purchase using the correct account. Please make sure you are purchasing under your BT e-Shareholder discount scheme account before you complete the transaction.
What do I do if I am on the BT Shop but can't see the e-shareholder discounts?
If you are on the BT Shop and logged into your BT e-shareholder account, the discounted price that you are entitled to will automatically be displayed. Please note that the standard price will not be displayed but you can view your saving in the basket on the right hand side of the site. If you cannot view the discounted prices please make sure that you have registered for the e-shareholder discount scheme by checking under "Your Account". If you haven't registered yet for your discount you will need to register using your BT Shareview Access number.
Can I order by Phone?
No. In order to give the discounts that we do we have had to make this a web only offer.
Can I order for friends and family?
Your BT Shop account may be used to order goods for friends and family however payment must be taken from your credit/debit card and our contract for the provision of goods remains with you. Therefore any queries relating to that order or the goods provided must be made by the BT Shop account holder. Please note that a fair usage policy does apply and we reserve the right to revoke any BT Shop account that we feel may be being used for commercial reasons.
What do I do if my product becomes faulty within the 12 month warranty?
In the first instance you should contact the relevant help desk, the number can be found in your user guide or by viewing our online userguides.

Where has my store credit/vouchers gone? +
As you may be aware, the BT Shop website was re-launched on July 2nd 2007 when we upgraded the platform on which it runs.
Whilst this re-launch offered our customers lots of benefits including a far wider product choice than ever before, unfortunately it also meant that we were unable to transfer information held on your old BT Shop account. This includes any store credit that was waiting to be spent on your account, or any unredeemed vouchers.
Thankfully, this issue affects only a very small number of customers, however if you previously had unspent store credit on your account and you would like it reinstated, please send an email to assistance@shop.bt.com using the subject title "Missing Store Credit/Vouchers". It would be helpful if you could include the following information in your email:
your full name (forename and surname)
your postcode
the email address that was associated with your old BT Shop account
the email address that is associated with your new BT Shop account (it may be the same as above).
On receipt of your email, we'll verify the status of your credit and/or vouchers then reapply as necessary to your new BT Shop account.
If you don't have an account on the new BT Shop....
Don't worry, opening a new account is a very simple process and well worth the few minutes it takes. To open a new BT Shop account click here, then follow the on-screen instructions.

How do I cancel or amend an order? +
I’d like to amend my order
If you need to amend your order, feel free to give our Customer Service team a call on 0800 917 0510 (lines are open Mon – Fri, 9am – 5pm excluding bank holidays). If the order hasn’t progressed too far, we can add items or make changes to your order for you. Please note, we can progress your orders and queries much quicker via telephone rather than via email.
I’d like to change my payment method
If you’d like to make changes to your payment method and you’ve used PayPal, we may ask you to go into your account and change the payment method yourself. Once added we can amend this on the order for you.
I’d like to change my delivery address
If you’d like to make changes to your delivery address, we’ll also ask you to go into your BT Shop account and add the new address so we can add this onto the order for you. We don’t allow address changes on the first order you place with us.
I’d like to cancel my order
An order can only be cancelled prior to processing and/or dispatch. If the item(s) are in stock, then it’s more difficult to cancel your order.
If you’d like to cancel your order, log into your BT Shop account and select ‘Order and Returns’. If your order is still processing, then there’ll be an option for you to cancel it. If there’s no option there for you to cancel your order, then the order has progressed to a stage where you can’t cancel it and it’s on its way to you. You’ll then have to return the item(s) you’d like to cancel back to us, stated in our Distance Selling Regulation (DSR).

Why has only part of my order arrived? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why you haven't received your full delivery.
In brief...
If you've ordered more than one item from us, we may split the shipment so that you might get more than one delivery.
If you haven't received everything you expected, it's likely that any outstanding item(s) will follow soon after.
Further information...
If you order more than one item, we may decide to send the order as separate "consignments". For example if you order a printer and a cable, we might send the printer as one consignment and the cable as another. This is because the printer will come to us in its "own box" and can be re-shipped to you in the same way, with the cable to follow - perhaps by post. If this is going to happen you will be told by email in advance, so before you contact us to report a problem, please check your email.
If you still think there is a problem with your delivery, or if what you have received does not match with the delivery note, please contact us. To do this, see below under "Need Further Assistance" and we will try and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Please have your "order number" ready to quote when you do contact us.

If you can have your order delivered to a work address.
What arrangements you need to make to organise a delivery to a work address.
In brief...
We understand that you may be at work during the day when your order is likely to be delivered.
To make things easier, you can choose to have goods delivered to a work address, but please bear in mind that our carrier might not be able to bring goods straight to you, and may have to leave them with your "goods in" department or a receptionist.
If this is the case, please be sure to arrange this before you order as we always need someone to sign for goods.

Why is “Next Day Delivery” not shown as a delivery option at the checkout? +
When you get to the ‘Shipping’ section of our checkout process, we’ll show the delivery options that are available to you depending on your order. Even though we have a wide range of delivery options available, they’re not applicable to every order. In some cases, you may find that you’re unable to choose the delivery option that you want.
Here are some reasons why:
You’re placing your order after our 6pm cut off
You live outside of UK mainland
The item(s) you’ve ordered are out of stock
There’s not enough time for us to process your card payment and process your order before the last truck leaves our warehouse
We want to get your order to you as quickly as possible but unfortunately, for reasons stated above, it’s not always possible for us to dispatch it immediately. We’d prefer to give you a realistic expectation of the delivery time for your order, rather than disappoint you by promising things that can’t happen. We hope you understand our reasons.

Not available to receive delivery +
If your order status is showing as 'completed', then it's too late to make any amendments at this stage.
If nobody will be available to accept delivery at the address you originally submitted, then our couriers will leave a card to say they attempted delivery. The card will include details of how to rearrange, or indeed when they intend to attempt delivery again.
The courier will hold the goods at your local depot for up to 4 days before returning them back to our National Logistics Centre. We'll automatically arrange a credit against your original payment method when we get the goods back (though your carriage charge won't be refunded).
Some customers have asked why we can't just call the courier and ask them to redirect the order. To help protect against fraud, unfortunately this isn't possible. We're only able to deliver to the address which was authorised as part of the security checking process.
If your order is still outstanding and therefore has not yet been dispatched
then you can change your delivery address by editing it via the 'my account' section of the website. Click here for help on amending your delivery address.

How Can I amend the delivery address of an order? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How to change the delivery address of an order already placed.
When you can't change the delivery address of an order.
If an order can be redirected once it's been despatched.
In brief...
If you realise that you won't be available to accept delivery of an order, you can change the delivery address, PROVIDED the order has not been "completed" or shipped. Read below to learn how to do this.
If the order has been completed you won't be able to change the delivery address - or redirect it - for security reasons.
For new customers, we can only deliver to the registered credit/debit card holder address for the first couple of orders.
Further information...
To change the delivery address of your order [if it's still outstanding], first log onto your account by clicking the "my account/log in" link at the top right of our website. Then click "View Orders and Returns" in the "Orders and Returns" section. From the orders listed which are still outstanding, choose the order you want to change, and select "Change delivery address". You will then see any addresses already on your account, so you can either choose one of those or add a new address.
If you are a new customer or have only ordered a few times, there may not be an option to change the delivery address. This is for security reasons to prevent fraudulent use of your credit card. In this case we can only deliver to your registered credit card address.
If your order status is showing as "completed" then you will not be able to change the delivery address. If nobody will be available to accept delivery, the carrier will leave a card and you will be able to contact them to re arrange or collect from their depot. If you do not make arrangements, the order will be returned to us after 4 days, and you will be credited for the order less the carriage charge.
Unfortunately, once an order has been despatched, it can't be redirected to another address for security reasons.

If you can change the information on an invoice.
In brief...
When your order is despatched, we produce an invoice which is emailed to you if you've set that as a preference on your account.
Unfortunately, we're not able to change any of the information printed on the invoice, including the date.
Further information...

What does 'awaiting stock' mean? +
'Awaiting stock' means that we currently do not physically have the product(s) you have ordered available in our warehouse to fulfil you order. Rest assured, we are doing everything possible to secure this stock with the minimum delay to your order.
If we know the date on which we expect stock, we will display it on our website. Please note that this is the most accurate date we have been given by our suppliers as as such, we're unable to provide any further information. If the expected stock due date passes, due to reasons beyond our control, we will endeavour to update the date shown on our website as soon as we have the new information.
If no delivery dates are shown, then this means we do not have a date to give you, but we are working to obtain this.
Although we do try to obtain the goods in a timely manner, there are occasions where either the product is in short supply (normally because it is a new product), or it has been delayed in transit. In such instances, we regret that we are unable to guarantee a date for the arrival of this item.
If you need your goods in a hurry and don't wish to wait, you can amend your order to replace it with an in-stock product. Alternatively, you can cancel your order at any time prior to completion.
If you would prefer to wait for your item to become available, then there is no need for further action.

Has my order been shipped? +
Once your order’s been shipped, you’ll receive an email with your tracking information, as well as details of the chosen courier who’ll be delivering it to your chosen address.
You can also see if your order’s been shipped by logging into your BT Shop online account and selecting the ‘Orders and Returns’ tab. If your order’s been shipped, then the tracking information will be visible in the ‘Orders and Returns’ tab.
Another way to know if your order’s been shipped is if we’ve taken payment from you. We only take payment and send you an e-receipt when we’ve shipped the item(s) to you.
Please note, if your order’s not been dispatched because it seems stock is unavailable, then you’ll see this on the ‘order status’. If you need your order in a hurry and don’t want to wait, then you can amend your order to an ‘in-stock’ item, to make sure it’s dispatched quicker, or amend/cancel your order.

What the various "order status" messages mean.

Once you've placed an order with us, it goes through various stages before it's despatched - including payment authorisation and packing, right through to "completed".
You can check what stage (the status) it's at by logging into your account and choosing the order.

Then, when you go into a particular order, you could be shown one of a number of different messages, depending on the status of your order at that particular time. For example it could say; order placed/payment problem/completed.
Here's a more detailed explanation of what these different descriptions mean, in the order that you can expect to see them (if relevant of course):
Awaiting 3D Secure Re-Authorisation
Your credit card details have been submitted for authentication and approval through VISA or MasterCard. More details about this scheme can be found on the VISA or MasterCard website. In short, this is an added security system specifically designed for buying via the Internet.
Awaiting Card Authorisation
This means that your payment is in a queue of payments to be actioned by our credit card security team. We do aim to attempt all payments within 2 hours.
Awaiting Processing
All our security checks have taken place and payment has been taken from your preferred payment method. Your order is now in a queue in our warehouse awaiting despatch. Your order should only be in this status for a maximum of 2 hours.
Awaiting Security Check
Your order is in a queue of orders which are awaiting security checks on the details you have provided to us.
Awaiting Stock
One or more items on your order are not available in our warehouse and this normally means we are waiting for these to arrive from our suppliers. If we do hold an expected delivery date, this will be shown against the product and will be the best information we have. The date may be subject to change. Unfortunately we are unable to give a more accurate date than the date we are showing.
Order Awaiting Packing
Payment has been taken and details of your order have been passed to our warehouse, but the items have not yet been picked for despatch. Depending on your chosen delivery method, this status could be active for up to 48 hrs. We are unable to cancel your order at this stage.
Packing in Progress
The picking of the items to fulfil your order has now begun, and this status will be active until all of the items have been placed into your consignment box. We are unable to cancel your order at this stage.
Order fully packed
All items have now been placed into your consignment box to complete your order and it is now awaiting courier collection. We are unable to cancel the order at this stage.
Completed
This means your order has been fully packed and has been loaded onto the delivery van, which may well have left the premises. We will send you an email at this point, confirming the despatch of the order.
Order Cancelled
Your order has been cancelled, either by you or our internal systems. Our internal systems cancel orders if we have not received any reply back from our communications. If you believe you have not received any notification, please check that the email address on your account is correct.
Order Placed
We can confirm that you have placed this order and it has yet to pass our security checks.
Payment Problem
Due to reasons out of our control, we have been unable to take the funds from your preferred payment method. You should contact your credit/debit card provider to find out the reason for this. Once you are happy that the payment will be cleared, you can email webaccounts@shop.bt.com and ask us to attempt to take the payment again.
Quotation
Your order is not live and is simply a quotation.
Security Check - Contact BT Shop
For reasons out of our control, we have been unable to authorise your details. This is normally an address issue and confirmation of these details can be sent to webaccounts@shop.bt.com. Please DO NOT send us your credit card details by email.
Stock Problem
One or more items on your order have now been discontinued by the manufacturer. This means that we are unable to supply this product to you and the next step would be to replace this item for an item which is in stock to allow your order to ship.

About same-day despatch +
If you place an order on our website and you choose the 'next day delivery' option, we'll try to ship your order the same day. However this can only happen if:
The goods you require are in stock.
You place your order before our 6pm weekday cut off time for next day deliveries.
The funds are in place - i.e. your credit card gets authorised for the value of the order.
Our other security checks are passed successfully.
If your order is in stock and your payment approved, then we'll dispatch your goods the very same day provided of course that you've selected the 'next day delivery' option and pass our security checks.
Please note: If you place your order late in the evening after our processing cut-off time or at the weekend or on a Bank Holiday then your order will be processed the next working day.

What does 'Ordered upon request' mean? +
When an item states 'Ordered upon request' this means that we currently do not physically have the product(s) you have ordered available in our warehouse to fulfil your order. Rest assured, we are doing everything possible to secure this stock and get it shipped out to you from the manufacturer.
If no delivery dates are shown, then this means we do not have a date to give you, but we are working to obtain this and when we have it we'll update and ETA on your order.
Although we do try to obtain the goods in a timely manner, there are occasions where either the product is in short supply - often because of demand or when a new product is released - or it has been delayed in transit. In such instances, we regret that we are unable to guarantee a date for the arrival of this item.
If you need your goods in a hurry and don't wish to wait, you can amend your order to replace it with an in-stock product. Alternatively, you can cancel your order at any time prior to completion.
If you would prefer to wait for your item to become available, then there is no need for further action.

Your shopping basket explained +
You may have noticed that a 'mini-version' of your shopping basket appears near the top right of our website. We hope you find this feature useful to keep an eye on your basket contents wherever you may browse to within our site.
When you click the 'buy' button on the product you'd like to purchase, you'll notice that this item is added to your basket along with the price of the item. Once you have selected all the items that you wish to order, click the "Checkout" button which is located at the bottom of the list of items in the basket. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to place your order.
Please note that if you click the 'buy' button more than once, you will increase the quantity of the relevant product in the shopping basket with each click. Please check at the checkout stage that the desired quantities are correct.
If someone else's name is shown above the shopping basket, then please click "if not, click here" to change the user to yourself, or you may find that you have items in which you are not interested in your basket.

What is a quicklinx code? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What a "quicklinx" code is.
How it can help you find a product quickly on our website.
In brief...
At BT Shop we have a range of over 15 000 products on our website, each of which has a unique 5 or 6 digit "quicklinx" code.
Whenever you see a product advertised in a catalogue or flyer, you'll see this quicklinx code next to the product so you can quickly find that product on our website.
To find a product, simply type the quicklinx code into the box at the top right hand side of our site, and hit the button with a magnifying glass icon.
Further information...
Besides using the quicklinx code to search for a specific product, there are other ways to look for products of interest. You can use the category tabs the top of the site or on the left hand side to browse, or you can use our fast and powerful site search engine at the top of the website. Simply type the name of the product or the type of product you want and hit the button with a magnifying glass icon. The results will be displayed instantly!

Why have you tried to debit my card with £0.01? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why we have debited your credit or debit card by £0.01.
In brief...
As a security measure we apply to your credit/debit card issuer for a debit of 1p when you place an order and it's ready to be despatched.
Once this is authorised, we can carry out other further security checks and authorise your order
The 1p is never actually debited form the card
Further information...
This is a security measure, taken to protect us both and to ensure that your card is not being used fraudulently. Once an order is placed on our website, we need to authorise it so that we can be certain that it's a genuine order placed by you, the actual credit/debit card holder.
This may seem a complicated way of conducting security checks but it's a process carried out by most internet and mail order retailers. It does not affect your credit/debit card balance, or the speed at which your order is dispatched.

Which delivery companies do you use? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Which delivery companies we use (sometimes called 'carriers' our 'couriers').
Why a particular delivery company is chosen to deliver your specific BT Shop order.
In brief...
We work with a number of carefully chosen delivery companies, all with great reputations for efficiency and service.
Depending on the delivery service you chose when you placed your order (e.g. standard, next day or evening delivery), combined with the size, weight and delivery address of the goods in your order, our system will automatically select the delivery company best suited to delivering your order at any given point in time.
Our main delivery partners are Royal Mail and Parcelforce.
The email you'll receive when your order is dispatched will tell you which carrier will be delivering it.
Further information...
Most of our deliveries are made by the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, but we may use other carriers - usually where goods are particularly heavy or bulky and require specialist handling, such as wide screen TVs and large format printers. Occasionally we'll send orders directly from the manufacturer.
As our system is constantly working to select the best delivery company for your order and takes many factors into consideration, we're afraid that it's not possible to state a preference for any given delivery company.

What is the card "reference"? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What we mean when we ask for a "card reference".
In brief...
When you enter your credit/debit card details for the first time on your account, you'll be asked for a "card reference" as well as the other card details.
The "card reference" is simply a name to help you to identify the card you are using, and might be something simple like "Visa" or "Switch"
Further information...
At BT Shop, you can securely store several credit/debit cards against your account. Whenever you add a credit card, we ask you for a "reference" to help you identify it when using it to pay for an order. It will also be shown on any outstanding and previous orders, so you know which card you used to pay for the order.
To add a new card to your account, log onto your account by clicking the "my account/log in" link at the top of our website. Once logged onto your account, click "Manage payment methods" under the "Your Account" section, and you'll see any credit/debit cards currently stored against your name with abbreviated card numbers for security. There you can add another card and edit or remove and existing card.

Why is the price in your advertising different to your website? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why there is occasionally a discrepancy between the prices advertised in our catalogues or advertisements, and those on our web site.
In brief...
The vast majority of our business is carried out online over the internet. Our web site is therefore the most up to date source of pricing as it's updated several times a day.
When we produce a peice of printed marketing, we always include a clearly visible date during which the price will be exactly reflected on our website (or be cheaper) PROVIDED you use the advertised URL.
If you do not come to our website via the advertised URL, or you come after the stated date, you may find that prices are slightly more expensive than those advertised due to occasional upward fluctuations in price.
Further information...
Whilst we do try hard to ensure that there's consistency between printed advertising and our website, due to the unpredictable nature of the IT and computer industry, prices do fluctuate. Provided you use the URL we advertise in print AND you visit before the stated 'offer ends' period, you will see that prices are the same or cheaper than those advertised.

Why am I asked for an "Order Reference" when placing an order? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What we mean when we ask for an "order reference" when you're placing an order.
In brief...
When you place an order with us, you have the option to give the order a unique "reference".
This can be a phrase, numbers or anything you like.
The order reference does not affect the order in any way.
Further information...
The reference is unique to you and can be anything you like which helps you identify that order. It might be something like "Dad's Birthday Present", or "Ink for printer".
This order reference is entirely optional, but is designed to help you distinguish one order from another. What you type in the order reference box is not seen by anyone, so please don't use it to communicate instructional information.

Can you advise me on the right product to buy? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
If we can advise you on choosing the right product for your needs before you order.
How you can get information on the products we sell.
In brief...
BT Shop is an internet or "on line" retailer. Our self-service model allows us to keep our costs low whilst delivering your goods as quickly and efficiently as possible. These cost savings are passed on our customers in the form of rock bottom prices.
Instead of employing salespeople to advise you on your purchase, we provide all the information we have available about any given product on our website so you can make the choice for yourself.
Our website uses the latest technology to display product information including technical specifications, video content, customer reviews and a comprehensive product comparison tool which allows you to compare technical specifications side by side.
We don't offer an advice service on products other than those manufactured by BT [see below].
Further information...
We're unable to offer "Pre-Sales" advice on product compatibility or any given product's suitability to meet your needs. If you have a specific question, we recommend you contact the manufacturer to check it will work in your particular situation.
We're constantly improving our website to offer more detailed information and a range of on line tools which you'll find useful when deciding what to buy.
We have a comprehensive "learn more" section with tips and information to help you make your choice.

Why do you ask for a landline telephone number when I create my account at BT Shop? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why we request a landline telephone number to be supplied when you create your account.
In brief...
When you create your account on our website, we request a landline telephone number is supplied in all cases.
We do this mainly for security reasons.
In the event that we encounter issues regarding payment details or delivery addresses, we will contact you on this number to qualify the situation.
Further information...
We're sorry if you are unable to provide a landline telephone number, but unfortunately, it is required by BT Shop in order to accept your order and as such, we are unable to create an account without it.

Possible fraudulent transaction +
Please note that this article is aimed at people who have had no contact with BT Shop and believe their card number has been stolen and used by someone else. It's not aimed at customers who have ordered via the BT Shop website and have a query regarding their card charge or refund.
If your credit card statement shows an entry for BT Shop and you've no idea why this charge is there, then it is possible that a fraudulent person may have used your card details to buy products from us. If this is the case, please email our web accounts department at webaccounts@shop.bt.com. To help us, please submit the following information:
The BT Shop transaction date showing on your statement
The exact amount
The postcode of the address where the card is registered
Any other information regarding why/how you think this might have happened
Once we've received the information from you, we will check those details against our stored information to see if any further orders have taken place, stopping any outstanding transactions on our system.
Due to the Data Protection Act, we are unable to give you any information about the address, name, telephone number, or email address against any specific transaction your card has been used for. However, this information will be provided to the police at their request once they have provided us with the relevant paperwork to disclose the details.
As a UK card holder, in such instances, you're protected under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. So, providing you confirm to your card issuer, to their satisfaction that you've not placed the transaction in question, then the charge will be cancelled by them.
Note: Our advice if the above was to happen, would be to contact the credit card company/bank immediately to stop your card being used for any further transactions.

Our delivery charges explained +
When you're at the checkout, our system will automatically calculate the delivery charge that is applicable to your order.
In calculating the delivery charge, our system references the size and weight of the items you have chosen, as well as the delivery address and delivery service you choose. For an exact price on carriage therefore, please make sure you visit the checkout section.
The delivery option I want isn't showing - why is this?
Not all of the delivery services in our range are available for every order. For example, we may not always be able to offer a Next Day 9am service to "outlying areas" such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
Similarly, on your first order, you may not be given the option for a Next Day delivery service as we need to perform more actions on your order before dispatch which may delay the process a little.
Please note that Next Day delivery is only available for orders placed before 6.00pm. Orders placed after 6.00pm will be shipped the next working day after placement.
Please click here for a full breakdown of delivery options and charges.

Our security policy +
We take very great care to ensure that any personal information you enter on the BT Shop website is kept safe. The following section explains how we keep your data secure.
Security Technology
When you type in your registration details or credit card number, our website automatically changes into secure mode. When you're submitting details to the BT Shop over the Internet, security is handled as follows:
Firstly, when your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) connects with the secure side of our server (website computer), that connection is between you and the server alone.
Secondly, the information you're sending us will be encrypted before it begins its journey over the internet to BT.com. This ensures that it can't be read by anyone else while it's in transit. In other words, during the communications between your browser and our server, the information is scrambled. This is known as encryption, the grade of encryption used could be 128, 168 or 256 bits, depending on the browser. 128bit encryption uses billions (2 to power of 128) of possible combinations to scramble the information. The enabling technology is called Transport Layer Security, or TLS for short.
Thirdly, any information we store internally so we can process your order, is kept on a computer system that operates independently of the web server and doesn't use an operating system that is prone to viruses, hacking etc.
In summary, we've taken the appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is not unlawfully processed. BT Shop uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. BT Shop treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorised access. However, no information transferred over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
Why does a screen prompt tell me my security certificate is out of date?
A certificate is a piece of software that your browser uses to encrypt your personal information when it's being transmitted to and from the BT Shop. The message you're getting is probably erroneous. It's usually caused by older browser versions that don't process date information correctly. The solution is easy. Upgrade your browser to a newer version.
Why can't I see a padlock icon in Internet Explorer but can in Netscape Navigator?
Some older versions of Internet Explorer do not use the padlock icon to indicate whether an online page is using a secure protocol. To check whether a page is secure, look at the URL in the Address window. If it starts with the letters https instead of the usual http, it is secure. Alternatively, right click your mouse over the Address window and select Properties. If the page is secure, you'll see the words Transfer Protocol Privacy protected.
Netscape Navigator shows a locked padlock to indicate when a page is using a secure protocol. However, a few pages on the BT Shop or on BT.com still use frames that are effectively pages within pages. When this is the case, a secure frame within a page that doesn't contain secure information will still show an unlocked padlock. This doesn't mean that your personal information is insecure. To check, look in the Location window. If the page starts with the letters https instead of the usual http, it is secure. Alternatively, move your mouse over the frame you want to check, right click and select Open in New Window. That frame will now be in a new window and should show a closed padlock.
What are cookies and does BT use them?
You can find details on what cookies are, how BT uses them and how to disable them in our Privacy Policy.
Information on cookies can be found in our Help section.

Why won't you erase my details? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why we can't remove your personal details completely from our system.
In brief...
When you place an order with us, we need to record your name, address(es) and payment details, so that we can deal with your order and ship it.
Unfortunately we are unable to totally erase these details from our systems.
Further information...
We need to keep your details for legal reasons and because the payment for your order forms part of our computerised accounting records. However, we do do everything possible to keep your personal information, including your payment card details, totally safe and secure.
The only time you'll see your full credit card number is when you first supply it. After that, it's always abbreviated even when you edit it in your account.

Do you export goods (deliver to addresses outside of the UK)? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
If we export goods outside the UK.
In brief...
We regret that we do not ship goods outside of the UK; this includes orders to BFPO (British Forces Posted Overseas) addresses.
We do not ship to the Republic of Ireland/Eire, though we do ship to Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands.
Further information...
We regret that we cannot take orders for invoicing or delivery outside the UK.
However, we do ship to the Channel Islands but orders may incur additional carriage charges. click here to read more.
If you're taking goods out of the UK/EU and wish to re-claim the VAT, you should contact your local Revenue & Customs office for information. Unfortunately we are unable to supply forms directly.
Read more...
Do I always need to pay VAT at BT Shop? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
When you DO have to pay VAT on products purchased from us.
When you DO NOT have to pay VAT.
In brief...
All the goods we supply at BT Shop are subject to VAT (in line with current legislation), with a few exceptions.
Claiming "VAT back" when you leave the UK - if you wish to do this you'll need to obtain the relevant forms from HM Revenue & Customs. We do not supply the forms but you can get them from Revenue & Customs.
Channel Islands - If you live in the Channel Islands you will not be charged VAT, see below.
Goods shipped outside the UK - We do not ship goods outside the UK at this time.
Further information...
Channel Isles
Products shipped to the Bailiwick of Guernsey and States of Jersey are not charged VAT. This is because the Channel Islands aren't part of the European Union with respect to VAT.
Our system records multiple addresses to a single account. If any address contains a valid GY or JE postcode, that address is marked as being 'outside the VAT area'.
To qualify for VAT-free shipping, it's the delivery address, not the cardholder address, or invoice address (business customers only) which must have the JE or GY postcode. Channel Island residents shipping products to mainland addresses will be charged VAT.
Read more...
At what point do you take payment? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
At what point we debit your chosen payment method when you've ordered from us.
In brief...
We will only take the payment from your credit card, debit card or chosen payment provider when the goods you've ordered are about to be 'picked' from the shelves in our warehouse in readiness for despatch. We don't take payment at the point that you place your order.
Further information...
It's our company policy to only take the payment from your credit card, debit card or chosen payment provider once your goods are ready to be 'picked' and not when you place your order. On some occasions, we could instruct our suppliers to ship an item to you directly and this would be the only occasion when we take the funds from your card or payment provider before having the goods in stock. Our suppliers attempt to ship the next working day, so you shouldn't see any difference or delays from the time the payment is taken to receiving your goods.
Important note: When you place an order with us via either our standard checkout you are offering to buy the item(s) in your basket at the price stated. Please note that your order will not be accepted at this stage. Only when we confirm our acceptance of your order in writing and payment is taken will a contract exist between us. If we do not accept your order, we will of course refund any payment taken from your debit or credit card.

Orders to BFPO addresses +
We regret that BT Shop is unable to deliver to BFPO (British Forces Posted Overseas) addresses.
This is for general commercial reasons and should our policy change, we'll advertise it on our website.
We do thank you for your interest in the BT Shop and are sorry that on this occasion, we are unable to assist.

Return of Faulty Goods: Packaging Guidelines +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What you need to do to ensure that goods being returned to us are adequately packaged.
In brief...
If you're returning something to us it's important that it is packaged correctly so that it does not get damaged during transit.
We therefore suggest that you package the item in its original packaging (assuming that you have the packaging and it is still intact).
Where it's not possible to use the original packaging, please ensure that the goods are sufficiently packaged and cushioned to protect against any reasonable shocks, puncturing, scratching or damage that may occur during carriage, handing and/or sorting.
Further information...
Please note that it is in the interest of all parties to ensure that any faulty goods being returned to us are sufficiently packaged to protect against loss and/or damage during carriage, handling and/or sorting. Therefore, when you intend to return any faulty goods, we strongly recommend that you do so in their original packaging (assuming that the original packaging is not damaged).
Where it is not possible to use the original packaging, then we would be most grateful if you would package and cushion the goods to provide protection against any reasonably predictable shocks, puncturing, scratching and/or damage that may occur during carriage, handling and/or sorting, although we accept that you do not have an obligation to do so.
Where we have agreed to collect the goods from you, then our appointed carrier shall be entitled to inspect the quantity, condition and the packaging.

What is the unscheduled delivery service? +
Unscheduled delivery means it is not possible for your order to be delivered on a specific date or within a specific 3 working day range. In instances like this, we'll despatch your order as soon as we can, though we cannot guarantee delivery on a specific date.
Unscheduled delivery is often selected for you because we can't process your order straight away. Maybe we must await authorisation of your payment or an item on your order is out of stock.
Rest assured we are working hard to send your order to you as soon as possible.

BT Shop and the WEEE Regulations +
WEEE Regulations for disposal of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Information for consumer customers in the UK
Look out for this symbol!
If the symbol shown here is found on any of your goods, it means that the product is classed as Electrical or Electronic Equipment and is covered by the WEEE Regulations.
We can help
We are pleased to offer our customers the chance to recycle their old electrical items when purchasing a new item from us. Please do not throw any electrical equipment (including any marked with the crossed out wheeled bin symbol) in your bin.
What is WEEE?
The Waste Electrical or Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires countries to maximise separate collection and environmentally friendly processing of these items. In the UK, distributors (including retailers) must provide a system which allows all customers buying new electrical equipment the opportunity to recycle their old items free of charge.
The BT Shop is a member of a Distributor Take Back Scheme, this means that we help to fund collection facilities and treatment of electrical and electronic waste across the UK – so that you can be sure that any WEEE that you take for recycling, is treated in the best way to protect human health and the environment. When you have finished with an electrical or electronic product, please do not put in your domestic waste bin, as it will not be recycled, use one of the following;
Recycle: Take the WEEE to your local collection facility - normally this is your local recycling centre. To find your nearest site, just go to http://www.recycle-more.co.uk
Return to BT: Follow the instructions here to return your equipment to us, we will then make sure that it is recycled properly.
UK Battery Directive
Information for consumer customers in the UK
What is the Batteries Directive?
This directive sets out clear guidelines for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste industrial, automotive and portable batteries.
All batteries are required to be labelled with the appropriate battery label.
Batteries Regulations are enacted to make sure that products are recycled using the best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques to protect human health and the environment..
How do I know if my product is covered?
If the wheelie bin symbol is marked on any of your products, it means that it is covered by the Batteries Regulations.
How do I recycle my old batteries?
Portable Batteries (e.g. Alkaline AAA) can be return to BT Shop in person at BT National Distribution Ctr, Darlington Road, Northallerton, DL6 2PJ.

Coronavirus +
Information for our customers regarding Coronavirus (Covid-19) at BT Shop
Last updated: 08:45 on 24th April 2020
At BT Shop, we're busy making sure the impact to our customers is minimal, our people are protected and the service you've come to expect is maintained.
The technology products we sell have never been more important. As self-isolation happens, more people need to work from home and communities look to stay connected. Our ability to support you as customers, and protect our teams, is our priority.
As an online business, we're working hard to ensure continuity of supply for the products you can buy from us. And we're reacting all the time to the changes we see.
Can I still contact you?
Yes. Our customer service teams are still working and remain contactable through email and Live Chat, 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday. Emails should be addressed to shop@bt.com and Live Chat can be accessed on our main help page. Get in touch and we'll be able to help.
Can I still buy from BT Shop?
Yes. You can order as normal online. Our systems and teams are operational and we'll be working hard to make sure it's business as usual. If you need help placing an order, we can help via email and Live Chat. However, you'll need to have a BT Shop account already created with a valid payment method setup. You can access that here.
Is stock an issue?
We have large volumes of stock, but in these unprecented times availability is constantly changing. Where our product pages show a delivery countdown timer - that stock is in our warehouse ready to go. Where we only state 1-3 or 3-5 day delivery on our product pages, that means it's with our supplier and while we'll aim to secure that stock for you - we cannot guarantee it and you may find your item backordered.
Where we state 'Not in Stock' or 'Ordered upon Request' we have no current ETA for those items. If you order they will be backordered and we'll update you, but if you need an item sooner we recommend selecting an 'in-stock' item for your order.
Are deliveries impacted?
Our website will reflect our stock availability and expected delivery dates during checkout- but there could be some delays in deliveries depending on demand.
Large Items - As of April 24th Parcelforce have lifted some of the suspensions on their 'large services' meaning we've been able to list the items that had been removed from sale, including large screen TVs. While you can order as normal, please note delivery may take up to 5 days.
Next Day Delivery - While these will still be prioritised by BT Shop, as our couriers are struggling to make service guarantees, we've updated our systems to reflect a delay in despatch and delivery. If you select a Next Day service we'll despatch the item on that service, but delivery will be delayed. During checkout we'll state the date we expect the item to reach you, but it cannot be guaranteed.
1-3 Day Delivery - We're still working to this wherever we can but you may experience slight delays that mean deliveries land within 3-5 days. Please be assured we, and our couriers, will keep you updated via email and text.
Free Gift - If you've had a 'Your free gift is almost ready' email our warehouse is preparing to send it. Sit tight and within a few days you'll get a 'Your free gift is on its way' email with tracking details.
If you're expecting a free gift and have not either had an email with a voucher code, or an email from BT Shop to state 'Your free gift is almost ready', please call 0800 800150 and the customer service teams will review your eligibility.
As things change, we’ll keep you up to date online via this page, email and our social channels wherever we can. Please keep visiting this page for the latest information.

What does OEM mean? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What OEM means.
Why manufacturers make OEM products.
In brief...
OEM means "Original Equipment Manufacturer".
OEM products are usually aimed at computer assemblers or "system builders", and designed be installed or used with a newly built PC or a PC being upgraded.
Typical OEM products include bare hard drives, motherboards, sound cards, software and keyboards/mice.
If you buy a product as "OEM", it will usually be cheaper that the RETAIL equivalent because, you won't get retail packaging (a fancy box), a user manual, software drivers or installation instructions.
Manufacturers have "OEM" versions of products as a concession to companies who are building PCs and do not require the extras included in RETAIL packaged products. This includes not providing technical support on software too.
Further information...
If you're building or upgrading a PC, OEM is a good way of making savings. However you need to remember that you probably won't get a user manual and may need to download software drivers etc for your components.
If you buy OEM software, it's unlikely that the manufacture will offer technical support. That's one of the reasons why it's available at a cheaper price.
If you're price comparing products, and find that we've both versions of a specific product on offer and a competitor only has one price that is much cheaper, it will normally be the OEM version.

What is Pixel tolerance? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What a pixel is.
How pixels can sometimes fail in a screen.
How there is an acceptable tolerance level which may vary from one manufacturer to another.
In brief...
Pixel stands for "Picture Element". The picture on an LCD or plasma display is made up of thousands of pixels which can't usually be seen individually by the naked eye. Each pixel is made up of three sub pixels [red, green and blue]. However working together these pixels make up the image you can see on a display.
As the number of pixels on a screen is so huge, it's possible that there will be some failure at manufacturer level. When ordering a LCD or Plasma display, or a device which has a display built in such as a laptop, you should be aware of the possibility of pixel failure.
There is a commonly accepted "tolerance level" set by each manufacturer, such that a display is only said to be faulty if the number of dead pixels exceeds this level. We can only take back displays as "faulty" if the number of dead pixels exceeds the manufacturer's guidelines.
Further information...
Despite what's been said, these faults are usually so subtle that you may never even notice the problem.

Can I get the data back from something I've returned to you? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
If you return a product which has data stored on it - such as a hard drive, a PC, or a digital camera - will you be able to get the data back?
In brief...
On the rare occasion when a product develops a fault, you may need to return it to us for repair or replacement.
If the product contains your stored data, unfortunately we aren't able to recover the data or guarantee that it will not be seen by anyone else during the repair process.
We suggest that you back up the data before returning the product to us if you can.
Further information...
If you return a faulty product to us which contains storage media such as a hard drive or flash RAM - for example a PC or digital Camera - then that data probably won't be on it when you get it back if its repaired. And it certainly won't be there if you get a replacement, so you'll need to back up the data before you return it to us if you can. We hold no responsibility for the recovery of that data.
Part of the repair process may involve the device being returned to the manufacturer for inspection. In that case we are no longer in control of the device and so the data stored on it may be seen by the manufacturer. If the data is confidential, we can't be responsible for who'll see it. We suggest you remove confidential data if you can before you return the product to us.
Although storage devices are very reliable and have a life expectancy of several years, we always recommend that you back up your data regularly in case a fault develops. There are many products which are commercially available to help you back up your data.
There are companies who may be able to recover data from a faulty product but this might mean taking the product apart and may invalidate the warranty.

What do I do if I have received "non UK" stock? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What to do if your product does not appear to be "UK" i.e. has a European keyboard or user manual.
In brief...
Occasionally our suppliers accidentally send us "non UK" stock, which may have a manual in a foreign language or a different configuration for the keyboard.
This is purely down to human error on the manufacturer or suppliers part.
If you've received a "non UK" product we apologise for this error. Please use our on line returns system to arrange for a return/replacement, and we'll arrange for the item to be collected at our expense. [Please see below under "articles of interest"].
Further information...
Unfortunately, we're not able to send you the UK version in advance, even if you simply need a keyboard or a UK manual as we do not hold stock of these items.

How can I check if a product is in stock? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
If the product you want to order is in stock.
When an "out of stock" product is likely to come into stock.
When you can expect to take delivery of something that's currently showing as "not in stock".
In brief...
We have a large warehouse facility and keep plenty of stock on popular products and special deals.
We don't keep everything that we sell in stock at any one time because we carry over 15,000 different lines. However, we do our best to give you a good idea when you might get your order.
The current "stock status" of a product will always be displayed on our website for any given item.
Further information...
You can see the current "stock status" or "availability" of any product we sell on our website either on the product information screen, or after you've added it to your basket.
In stock items:
If a product is showing as "In Stock Now" and you chose the next day delivery option, we'll despatch your order the very same working day provided there are no problems with authorising your payment and you placed your order before our 6pm cut off (weekdays). The time it takes from despatch to your door will depend on the delivery service you select at the checkout.
Items not in stock:
Some products are described as "Not in Stock". This doesn't mean that you can't place an order though; it just means that we don't hold that particular product in stock as standard. If you go ahead and place an order, we'll get the item in just for you and in most cases, it'll be ready for despatch to you within 14 days - often a lot sooner. We'll keep you up to speed on the latest availability date by email. Once we've taken receipt of the item, we'll then need to process your order as if you'd ordered an "in stock" item - see above.
Items with other stock statuses:
If a product isn't in stock in our warehouse, but is available from one of our key suppliers, the expected delivery time (sometimes called "lead time") will be listed in days or weeks (i.e. Delivery 1-3 days)*.
The lead time shown always reflects the very latest advice from our suppliers and we're unable to provide a more accurate forecast.
The lead time shown always reflects the very latest advice from our suppliers and we're unable to provide a more accurate forecast. Please note that this lead time is an estimate, but is constantly updated electronically throughout the day. If you place an order and the expected delivery date changes, you'll get an update by email. You can also check the latest date we have by logging into your account and selecting "View orders and returns". Simply select the order you're interested in and you'll see the latest availability.
* Please note that this is the expected delivery date into our warehouse. Once we've taken receipt of the goods, we'll then need to process your order as if you'd ordered an "in stock" item - see above.

About “used stock” and used stock warranty +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What we mean by "used stock".
What the warranty is on used stock.
In brief...
You may have noticed that here at BT Shop we offer "used stock". This is a great chance to grab yourself a bargain!
These products have been discounted because there is a minor problem, such as a missing manual/software or the packaging is slightly damaged. Or, the product may have been repaired under warranty and is ready for re sale but not as new.
All used stock has a 180 day warranty and is in good working order.
All used stock has extended information about the actual reason why it's been classed as "used stock".
Further information...
Each individual used stock item has a reference number, and a short description of the condition of the product and why it's classed as used stock e.g. "Warranty repair", or "packaging damaged"
Hurry though - it's first come, first served!
Grabbing your bargain will be on a first come, first served basis. It may be possible for you to add an item to your basket only to find that someone has beaten you to it and completed their order before you do. If this happens you'll be notified at the checkout.
Please note
The individual items will have extended information displayed as to whether it is complete or if it is missing certain items . This is categorised into 'packaging', 'accessories', 'manuals', software' and 'functional'. It is recommended you double check this section prior to placing your order.

Why can’t I find what I’m looking for on your website? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How to search for products on our website.
Why you might not be able to find what you're looking for on our website.
In brief...
Hopefully we've made it really easy for you to find what you're looking for on our website! There are 2 main ways to search:
1. Use the "search" box at the top of our site and type in the name of the product you're looking for, or the type of product you want. Then hit GO, and you'll see a comprehensive list.
2. Use the headings on the left to browse by category and navigate to a range of products containing what you need.
If what you want does not seem to be listed there could be 2 reasons...
1. The product you require is so new that we've not added it to our site. We do have a team of people constantly adding new products, but we can only do this when we have been told by the manufacturer or our suppliers. If the item you want is new, your best bet is to come back to our site in a day or so and check again.
2. What you are looking for is now obsolete and we no longer have stock. We usually carry on listing products as long as we know we can still get hold of them. But, there comes a point when we need to remove products that are no longer available.

Why do some of your products not have a picture or full specification? +
We currently offer around 10,000 products for sale on the BT Shop website. Because we sell so many items, the descriptions, specifications, photographs and any other related product information we publish, is drawn from a third party company. This company specialises in providing online retailers, such as BT Shop with the very latest product/technical information. This is the most feasible and most advanced way of ensuring the vast amount of information we pass on to our customers is as accurate as possible.
However, as with every system, there will be a very small number of instances where the information being displayed is either slightly incorrect, out of date, or not available. We do have a team of people regularly checking the BT Shop website to ensure that these minor errors are dealt with when spotted.
If you do happen to experience problems accessing information for a particular product on our website (based on the reasons given above), then we suggest that you try to check on the product manufacturer's website for the relevant full specifications and features. Note that you should use the the manufacturer's UK website/UK product information source and not their 'International' website/product information, as there could be some key differences in the specifications offered.

I’ve ordered something which is now discontinued, what should I do? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What happens if a product becomes "discontinued" after you've ordered it.
In brief...
At some point a product may reach "end of life", when it's no longer available to buy.
We rarely get any warning about this, so you may find yourself in a situation where you've ordered something and it becomes discontinued.
If this happens, we suggest you remove the item from your order and chose an alternative replacement product.

Why is there no cable included with my printer? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
If you buy a printer will you get a cable with it?
In brief...
Almost all printer manufacturers don't include a cable to connect the printer to the computer as standard.
You'll need to purchase a cable as a separate item when you place your order, but we usually offer a special "bundle" price for a printer and cable when bought together. You'll see this when you see the printer listed on our website.
Further information...
Please see the manual to check what cable you need for your particular printer.

Why did I see the message: “Sorry, this product/bundle cannot be added to your basket"? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why you saw this message when you added a product or a bundle to your basket.
In brief...
At BT Shop, we regularly have great value "bundle" deals on our website, where we offer a special discount on the combined price of 2 or more products when bought together.
We are sorry, but you can't buy a bundle as well as one of the components of the bundle at the same time.
If you do try to do this, you'll get a message: "Sorry, this bundle cannot be added to your basket"? or "Sorry, this product cannot be added to your basket" (depending on what's already in your basket).
Example
Imagine there's a bundle which is made up of a digital camera and a memory card, and you have already added the memory card to your basket as a single item (including multiples of that single item). As you add the bundle to your basket, the message will appear explaining that you can't add it.
In this example, if you want to order 2 memory cards, you need to place two separate orders.
We appreciate this may cause some frustration and, of course, apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

Buying bundles +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How to buy an advertised 'bundle' deal.
In brief...
A 'bundle' deal comprises two or more items at a price that is discounted compared to buying those items separately.
To buy a bundle, you firstly need to view the main product in the bundle on our website (if the bundle is a laptop with free carry case for example, you should view the product information screen for the laptop).
Next, either click the 'bundles available' icon, or scroll down until you see the bundles section.
Find the bundle you wish to purchase (choose carefully as multiple bundle options may be available for any given product), then click the 'Add bundle' button.
The bundle should now be in your basket.
Further information...
Our system spreads the total bundle discount across each component part of the bundle. This means that a bundle comprising a laptop and free carry case for example, will actually show a charge on your receipt for both the laptop and the carry case. However, the total cost of buying both items would be equal to the cost of buying the laptop alone, therefore the carry case is free.

Why have I received another receipt for my replacement? +
When a faulty or otherwise incorrect product is replaced, please note that you'll receive either an e-receipt, which is a sales receipt sent electronically via email (applicable to private/consumer customers) or a tax invoice (applicable to business customers).
We have to send an e-receipt/tax invoice if we issue replacement products, for our records. It's a business requirement to acknowledge such transactions.
Please note that you do not need to do anything, no action is required. The paperwork is simply for your records.

Why have I received a credit instead of a replacement item? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why you've received a credit after you returned something to us, but were expecting a replacement product.
In brief...
If you returned a something using our on line returns system, you'll receive a "credit note" as we accept the returned item back into our warehouse.
This is merely confirmation that we've received the item back, and shows that the funds are being held on your account until we ship the replacement.
A replacement product will be shipped shortly after, and you don't need to do anything.
Further information...
If you returned something and requested a refund and not a replacement item, this will be shown at the bottom of the credit note we sent. We will refund the original payment method you used - usually credit card. The card number we be partially shown on the note and the funds will be credited to the card a few days later.
If you did request a replacement, and think its taking too long to arrive, please contact us using the link below under "Need Further Assistance" to request a refund to your credit card in the interim. We will then re charge the card when we do send the replacement.

Why doesn't BT Shop repair goods? +
Some customers ask if we repairs faulty products.
The answer is no, we don't. We sell around 15,000 products in total of which around 10,000 are hardware type products.
The BT Shop specialises in selling telephony, IT and technology products to customers via the Internet - it's what we're good at! It simply wouldn't be feasible for us to maintain the technical skills, spares and equipment required to carry out product repairs. Plus, in virtually all cases, the manufacturer does offer a full repair service.
What if the hardware is BT Branded?

Expiry dates on return numbers +
When an 'RMA' (which is short for 'Return Merchandise Authorisation') number is issued for either the credit of, replacement of, or the repairing of products, please be aware that this RMA returns number is active for a period of fourteen days (two weeks) only.
IMPORTANT NOTE - If we do not receive the products in question back within this timescale then your rma returns number will no longer be valid. This will lead to a delay in processing your return as we will have to manually process your return. So please ensure that you return products to us within the fourteen day timescale.
We do send reminder emails during the lifetime of a rma returns number. If we haven't received the products after the fourteen days have elapsed, we'll send to you another email to confirm that the return is no longer possible on that particular RMA returns number.
Please remember that depending on how the product is returned to us, that it could take a few days to physically arrive. We will take this into account. So for example, if you've returned your product to us within the fourteen day period, but your product is delayed in transit , then when it arrives we'll action the return under the original RMA number.
We quite often find that customers ask for a return on a product they believe is faulty and then get the product working which takes away the need to send the goods back to BT Shop. Alternatively, they may apply for an RMA - returns number and only send the products back some months later when the units warranty has expired.

Can I return software to you? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
If you can return software to BT Shop under the "distance selling regulations".
What to do if you think the disk containing the software you've ordered is faulty/scratched.
In brief...
If you've bought some software from us and decide you want to return it under the "distance selling regulations", you can return it provided that it's UNOPENED and in its original packaging.
If it has been opened, unfortunately we are unable to accept it back. We have to follow this policy because the return of opened software could lead to a possible breach of the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act (CDPA) 1988.
If you think the disk containing the software is faulty, we suggest you contact the manufacturer/publisher directly. You can get the contact details form the user manual.

What’s the reason for the delay in refunding my credit/debit card? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why a refund to your credit card has not been processed as expected.
In brief...
From time to time we may need to refund your credit card for some reason e.g. you've decided to change your mind about your purchase, or the product has developed a fault and you've returned it.
The delay is usually down to the way the credit card system works. Refunds generally take 3-4 days to work their way through the system - this is usually down to the banking system itself and is out of our control unfortunately.
For returned items, we will usually test the product when it's received back, this does sometimes take a day or two if we have a small backlog.
Further information...
If you need to contact us about a refund which has not been processed as expected, please use the link below under "Need Further Assistance?".
If you do decide to return a product, please read "How do I arrange a return?" which explains the full process. Please do not return anything without first obtaining a "returns authorisation number" - explained in the article.

Exchanging products +
We are occasionally asked if we are able to exchange goods rather than issue a refund against a return.
Unfortunately, for a variety of operational reasons, we regret that exchanges are not possible. However, do remember that if you've been in possession of your goods for less than 10 days, then you do have the right to return goods for a refund (conditions apply) provided of course they were purchased from BT Shop. The refund will be processed against your original payment method.

How do I arrange a return? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
What our policy is for returning products
How to tell us exactly what you want to return
How to make the arrangements to get it back to us
What will happen once we get it back
In brief...
There are many reasons why you might want to return your goods back to us. Maybe they're faulty or you've simply changed your mind and no longer require the goods.
So both you and us can track the progress of your return, you'll need to get a Returns Material Authorisation [RMA] number from us. If you send something back without an RMA number, we will not be able to identify it as yours when it comes back to our warehouse and the product will probably get lost. As such, all returns MUST have a valid RMA number. See below for instructions on how to get an RMA.
Here at BT Shop, we have a fully automated online returns system which automatically issues a returns number through your account on our website.
Before you start the online returns process, please read our RETURNS POLICY to check the circumstances under which we'll authorise your return. Click here to read our Returns Policy. Once you're happy that you'll be allowed to return the product, you'll need to get an RMA Number - follow the step by step process below.
How to process your return
Log In: Log into your account by clicking the 'My Account/Log In' link at the top of our website. Once you've logged in please select - 'view orders and returns' and choose the order that you wish to return goods from.
Select a product to Return: If you see a blue 'r' icon next to the order line this indicates that a product can be returned to the BT Shop. Click the blue 'r'. If there is no blue 'r' the product cannot be returned under our returns policy. To view our returns policy click here. A green "r" means that an RMA has already been issued for that product.
Select a Returns Reason: You'll then be shown a 'return reason' list. This allows you to select the reason why you're returning a product. There are a variety of reasons to choose from including - 'goods faulty on arrival'; 'goods not as ordered'; 'I've changed my mind' and so on. As you select your reason for return, our system is sophisticated enough to carry out a check to qualify that the reason you're selecting is a valid one. This is based on the date the order was shipped to you and the type of customer you're registered as - i.e. a private or business type customer, as some sections of our returns policy may differ.
Providing product fault information: If your product is faulty, you'll be asked to supply more information such as the type of product fault. This ensures that we get the right information so your return is processed quickly. You'll be asked to accept our "terms and conditions" before we can issue an RMA.
RMA confirmation number: Once you've completed the steps, the RMA confirmation screen displays your RMA number. You'll also get an email confirming the RMA details which provides you with more information about what you need to do next. It's important that you read this and follow the instructions carefully. IMPORTANT: Once we've issued an RMA number, it's only valid for 14 DAYS. During this time we'll send you a reminder by email. If we've not received the goods back after 14 days, the RMA number will no longer be valid. It's therefore important that you do send the goods back WITHIN 14 days of the RMA being issued.
Packaging Goods for Return
IMPORTANT: Please ensure that you read our Return of Faulty Goods: Packaging Guidelines. The product must be packaged correctly otherwise it may get damaged on its way back to us and we can't be liable for this damage.
What happens next?
Once the RMA has been issued you'll be able to track the progress of the return by logging onto your account, and clicking the "View orders and returns" section. Then click "returned" and you will see the status of your return. There are a variety of different returns status messages that may be displayed including for example: "awaiting return of goods", "fully refunded", "return cancelled" and so on.
Each type of status links through to an information box which contains a more comprehensive explanation of what it means to help you track your return, every step of the way.
Once we receive the goods back and have inspected them, we will either refund your payment [using the same payment type you used to pay for your order] or replace the goods or arrange a repair. This will depend on the reason you returned the goods and the length of time you've had the goods.

Please remember your RMA is only valid for 14 days so please return the item back to us as soon as possible.

Goods received which have been damaged in transit +
Whilst we take every care to ensure your goods are packaged in a way that protects them during transit, very occasionally damage does occur. Of course we apologise sincerely for any inconvenience this issue may cause.
If you believe goods have been damaged during transit, then please make a request to return the item(s) to us via our Online Returns Tool.
During the process of completing this online request, we'll ask you to provide us with as much information as possible about the damaged item(s) and the state of the packaging it arrived in. This will enable the most efficient resolution to your query.

When will I get my faulty item credited or replaced? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
How long it will take us to either replace or raise a credit for something which has developed a fault and has been returned
In brief...
It's rare, but occasionally products do develop faults.
If this did happen in your case, we'll have asked you to send the faulty item back to us.
We'll deal with the return as quickly as we can.
How long it will take to deal with will depend on how soon the fault developed after you received it.
Further information...
If your goods were faulty on arrival:
We will have issued an "RMA number" for the goods and asked you to return them to us. We will then refund you, using the same method as you paid for the order, once we receive the faulty goods back to our warehouse. We usually do this within seven days of receipt. If you've returned the goods and allowed time from them to arrive, yet still haven't received a credit, please contact us using the link below under "Need Further Assistance?". We know that some credit/debit card companies take a few days to credit funds to an account - so you need to be aware of this.
If your goods become faulty during use:
We will have issued an "RMA number" for the goods and asked you to return them to us. After we've received the goods, we will have sent them to the manufacturer to confirm the fault. When we receive a replacement or repaired item back from the manufacturer, we'll forward that to you as soon as we receive it. This process can take up to six weeks. However the average time is three weeks, often a lot shorter. If you've waited more than six weeks, please contact us using the link below.
If you've simply changed your mind about your purchase:
We will have issued an "RMA number" for the goods and asked you to return them to us in line with the "Distance Selling Regulations". We'll refund you within 30 days of you notifying us. If you've not received a refund within 30 days, please contact us using the link below under "Need Further Assistance?"

Why can't you always offer a refund or replacement when processing a return? +
Read on if you'd like to know...
Why you can't always chose to have a refund or a replacement product when arranging a return using our on line returns system.
In brief...
In the unlikely event that a product develops a fault, you can use our on line returns system to process the request for a return.
Whilst using the returns system, you might get one of the following messages:
"Refund not available for this product" or "Replacement not available for this product"
If you get one of these messages it's because our system has determined that it's not possible for the reasons below.
Further information...
Messages you might get:
"Refund not available for this product":
If we aren't able to offer a refund for the specific product you've chosen to return, it's because our returns system recognises that the maximum period during which you are entitled to a refund has expired. For more details, please read our Returns Policy.
"Replacement not available for this product":
If we aren't able to offer a replacement for the specific product you've chosen to return, it's because the item you originally purchased is no longer available and has been discontinued by the manufacturer. In this case we suggest you request a refund, and then place a fresh order for a similar replacement product.

Product Recall - Clover Leaf Power Cable +
PRODUCT RECALL - 13 Amp Plug to Clover Leaf Power Cable
We've been made aware by our supplier that a clover leaf (IEC C5) power cable that we may have supplied to you between 17th August 2012 and 20th March 2013 has been manufactured with a substandard cable. This means the cable can be prone to premature fraying and breakage when bent near to the clover leaf connector.
The affected power cables have a distinctive circular pattern on the back of the UK 13 Amp plug, with three triangles in the centre, as illustrated in the photograph below.
Please note:
The AC adapter is not faulty, and does not need to be replaced. Only the detachable mains cable is being recalled.
If you have one of the faulty power cables, please stop using it immediately and dispose of it. You can get a new replacement cable free of charge by completing the online form you will find here.
We apologise for any inconvenience that this product recall may cause. If you'd like to speak to a member of our customer services team, please contact us on 0800 917 0510 or via email at shop@bt.com

Returning Goods - Our Returns Policy +
We hope that you're pleased with your purchase from BT Shop, however we do understand that occasionally, you may need to return goods to us. We've set out below the main reasons why goods tend to be returned, so please read all of the categories and follow the returns process which you feel applies to you.
Please note that our Returns Policy for Consumers does not affect your statutory rights. You can get more information about your statutory rights from the Citizens Advice Bureau (www.citizensadvice.org.uk) or Consumer Direct (www.direct.gov.uk). We reserve the right to inspect the goods and verify any fault(s) and/or any damage.
If You Have Simply Changed Your Mind
If you have ordered goods from us, but then simply decided that you wish to cancel your order, then you are entitled to do so and have any money that you have paid to us refunded, provided that the goods have not been in your possession for more than 14 Days after the day on which you received the goods. Please note that you may not cancel any goods ordered from us where any audio or video recordings or computer software has been unsealed by you.
You will receive a refund via your original payment method as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 30 days after the cancellation of your order.
Goods Are Faulty On Arrival
If you find that your goods are faulty on arrival, then you are entitled to a repair, replacement or a refund. Please note that for some goods it may be disproportionately costly to repair those goods, and so where this is the case, then we will give you a replacement or a refund. Where any faulty goods are to be returned to us then please ensure that you read our Return of Faulty Goods: Packaging Guidelines.
Goods Become Faulty During Use
If your goods become faulty after delivery, we will always instruct you to contact the manufacturer directly for a warranty repair or replacement. This is often the quickest way to have a fault resolved. For example in some cases, manufacturers provide a special full on-site service and/or telephone help facilities for your convenience. Alternatively you can contact us directly if the goods do not conform to the contract made between us.
Please note that in some cases it may be disproportionately costly to repair the goods, and so where this is the case, then you will receive replacement goods. Where any faulty goods are to be returned to us, then please ensure that you read our Return of Faulty Goods: Packaging Guidelines.
Goods Damaged On Arrival
If you discover that your goods are visibly damaged on arrival, you should either write on the delivery note that the packaging is damaged, or refuse to accept the delivery. Please also contact us within 14 days with details of the damage. This will help us considerably in raising the matter with our appointed courier. Once the damaged goods have been received back into our warehouse, then we will replace them. In most cases, where goods are being returned to us due to damage on arrival, then a repair is simply not practicable.
Goods Not As Ordered
If you receive goods from us that differ from what you have ordered, then we require that you notify us within 14 days using our Online Returns Tool.
Goods Or Order Duplicated
In the event that that your order or goods have been duplicated by mistake, then please notify us as soon as possible using our Online Returns Tool.
Packaging Goods for Return
In all cases where goods are to be returned to us, then please ensure that you read our Return of Faulty Goods: Packaging Guidelines
Faulty BT Products
If you think you have a faulty BT product the first step is to contact our dedicated product helpdesks via a Freephone number so they can try and fix the problem for you. If they can't fix it they will give you a fault reference number which you can then use to return the product via our online system here. To find out what number to call please visit www.bt.com/help and type your product name into the search box.
