Privacy Policy:
The Toy Shop ("The Toy Shop")
operates thetoyshop.com.au and may operate other websites. It
is The Toy Shop's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, The Toy Shop collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Toy Shop's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how The Toy Shop's visitors use its website. From time to
time, The Toy Shop may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
The Toy Shop also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on thetoyshop.com.au
blogs/sites. The Toy Shop only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to The Toy Shop's websites choose to interact
with The Toy Shop in ways that require The Toy Shop to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The Toy Shop gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at thetoyshop.com.au to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with The Toy Shop are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, The Toy Shop collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
The Toy Shop. The Toy Shop does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
The Toy Shop may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. The Toy Shop may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, The Toy Shop does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
The Toy Shop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on The Toy Shop's behalf or to provide services available
at The Toy Shop's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using The Toy Shop's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. The Toy Shop will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, The Toy Shop discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when The Toy Shop believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of The Toy Shop, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an The Toy Shop website and have supplied your email address, The Toy Shop
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what's going on with The Toy Shop and our products. If you send us a request (for
example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The Toy Shop takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Cookies

provides to the website each time the visitor returns. The Toy Shop uses cookies to
help The Toy Shop identify and track visitors, their usage of The Toy Shop
website, and their website access preferences. The Toy Shop visitors who do not wish to have
cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
using The Toy Shop's websites, with the drawback that certain features

Business Transfers
If The Toy Shop, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event
that The Toy Shop goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
any acquirer of The Toy Shop may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this
policy.

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
Policy covers the use of cookies by The Toy Shop and does not cover the use of cookies by any

Although most changes are likely to be minor, The Toy Shop may change
its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in The Toy Shop's sole
discretion. The Toy Shop encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
