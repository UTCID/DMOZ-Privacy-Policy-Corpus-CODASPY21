FAQs regarding your order and the current COVID-19 outbreak
< Back to the main /help section
Will I get my order?
Yes. We are working as hard as we can under the current Government guidelines to continue shipping orders where stock is available. We are maintaining social distancing and shift patterns to keep the office and fulfilment environments as safe as possible for staff.
Will my order be delayed?
Possibly. As with all business during this time we are experiencing some disruption from our suppliers which is causing delays. You can check the status of your order and the expected despatch date in our help section here. We are trying to keep the despatch date information as up to date as possible but circumstances are changing daily. If your delivery date changes we will inform you by email. Your credit / debit card will only be charged when your items are due to be despatched. Please do not contact our customer service team for more information on delivery times – they only have the same information that you can find online.
When will my card be charged?
We only charge your card on despatch of your item. You can place your order confident in the knowledge that even if there is a delay in delivery, you will not be charged until your order is on its way.
How can I make a payment?
If you wish to pay off your outstanding balance the best way to do it is online by credit or debit card. You can make a payment here. We advise not to send any cheques/postal orders in at this time to limit your trips to the Post Office and because they are difficult for us to process right now.
I normally pay by cheque, what should I do?
If possible, we advise not to send any cheques/postal orders in at this time to limit your trips to the Post Office and because they are difficult for us to process right now. If you normally pay by cheque, you should have a debit card associated with the same account. You can make payment online using this card at www.westminstercollection.com/pay.
Can I check my statement online to see if I have any payments outstanding?
Yes you can, please click here to view your statement.
Can I return my order for a refund / replacement?
Of course. We have temporarily extended our no-quibble money back guarantee to 45 days to allow extra time in case you have to self-isolation. However, if you cannot / do not wish to visit your Post Office we can be more flexible if you let us know by contacting us via www.westminstercollection.com/help. So please don’t panic, but tell us your circumstances and then you can return your item when you are ready / allowed. In the event of Post Offices being closed, we will of course extend our standard returns policy to allow for this.
Is it safe to receive a delivery?
Most of our deliveries are made by Royal Mail who state: Public Health England has advised that there is no perceived increase in risk of contracting the new coronavirus for handling post or freight from specified areas. From experience with other coronaviruses, we know these types of viruses don’t survive long on objects, such as letters or parcels. (Royal Mail, 20 March 2020) Royal Mail and other courier companies have also placed a number of social distancing measures in place to avoid infection risk.
If I still need to contact you what should I do?
Our customer service team are mainly working from home which makes it more difficult for them to answer calls or letters. So please visit www.westminstercollection.com/help to contact us. You can also:
- Check the status and expected delivery dates of your orders- Manage any collection subscriptions- Arrange replacements and returns- View your account statement online
And if you can’t find your answer you will be directed to the best way to contact us.
