Cancelling or Changing an Order

Can I Cancel my Order?
You can request to cancel all or part of your order before we have started to pick and pack it. As long as the delivery process has not progressed past a certain point, we will be able to cancel your order or remove items from it. You need to log in to your account to send your request.
If you have an order that's being sent in a number of separate dispatches, you can cancel any items that are not yet ready to send to you.
If your order includes a multi-buy promotion such as Buy One Get One Free or a Promotion Code then you will have to cancel all items affected by the promotion.
If we've been unable to supply a product within 30 days, we'll cancel the order and notify you - with the exception of products that have yet to be published or released.
Please note that e-gift cards and digital downloads cannot be cancelled or changed.
Same Day Click & Collect orders can only be cancelled in store. If you cannot attend the store to cancel, you must wait for automatic cancellation after 10 days of non-collection. Your card will be automatically refunded and the money will appear in your account within a few days.

How Do I Request to Cancel my Order?
You can request to cancel your order by logging into your WHSmith Account. If you do not have an account or are experiencing problems then you can contact our customer services team for assistance.
Please note that customer services cannot cancel Same Day Click & Collect orders - these can only be cancelled by visiting the store, or waiting for automatic cancellation after 10 days.

Can I Change my Order?
You can cancel all or some items from your order before they've been prepared to send to you - after this time, the order can't be changed.
Once you've placed an order, you can't add products, change your delivery address, change the delivery method or change your payment.
