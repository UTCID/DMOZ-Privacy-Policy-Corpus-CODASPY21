Holiday Shipping Schedule
To assure delivery in time for Christmas, please reference the following chart:

*Per UPS, delivery times may vary and are NOT guaranteed at this time.
Express Shipping
UPS Ground is our standard method of shipping which can vary from 3-6 business days for delivery. However, we also offer you the opportunity to use UPS' express shipment options, including 3-Day Select, 2nd Day Air, and Next Day Air.
Shipping Information
The majority of orders for in-stock items purchased during our peak season are shipped within 24 hours. Orders are shipped from our warehouse in Omaha, Nebraska - smack dab in the middle of the country - so allow 3-5 business days shipping time to either coast using standard shipping, while other locations will vary from 2 to 3 business days.
Available Inventory
We stock nearly EVERY product that we sell...and we keep a lot of product in stock. Unlike most online retailers, we like to give our customers as much information as we can so that you can feel confident in your buying decision. One such piece of information is actual stock levels. On each and every product page, you'll find a very accurate count of available inventory at that given moment. This should give you the confidence that not only is the item in stock, but we actually have "N" number of units available to ship.
Backordered Product
If a product is listed as "backordered" or "currently on order", that means that we are waiting on a shipment from the manufacturer. At this time of the year, our manufacturers occasionally get bogged down. As a result, we're unable to guarantee holiday delivery for items that are backordered.
Out of Stock Products
If a product is listed as "out of stock" or "not currently available for purchase", it means that we have sold our entire inventory of that product and will NOT be getting more prior to the holidays.
Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Territories, APO/FPO
Because UPS Ground is not an option for these areas, we ship through the US Postal Service. Unfortunately, when shipping USPS, you'll need to allow several additional days for it to be shipped and we also do not have the granular level of tracking that we do with UPS. If you're having an order shipped to one of these areas, we strongly encourage you to place your order before December 13th to allow adequate time for delivery.
International Orders
If you're having an order shipped Internationally and want it delivered for the holidays, we suggest that you place your order no later than December 5th. However, because delivery times vary so widely from country to country, we cannot guarantee international deliveries before the holidays.
After the Sale Support
We're here to support you before AND after your purchase. Unlike some large online companies who will only communicate with you via email, we're always just a phone call away! Just call us toll-free at 1-800-590-5987 and let us know how we can help.
Bottom Line
We want your holidays to be joyful and hassle-free - that's what we're here for. We'll do everything in our power to insure that you receive what you ordered AND in time for the holidays. If we can't, we will communicate that to you well in advance so that you can make other arrangements.
If the above doesn't answer your questions, we encourage you to either email us at cs@fatbraintoys.com or call us toll-free at 1-800-590-5987.
2020 has been a challenging year, to say the least. Nevertheless, we hope to make your Christmas and Hanukkah shopping as stress-free as possible!
Because of COVID-19, supply chains have been disrupted across all product categories, including toys. Fat Brain Toys has stocked up early, but we are still anticipating possible shortages as we get into December. Plus, we've been warned by our carriers that deliveries could be delayed during the peak shipping season.
To avoid the potential for delays, we ask that you please shop early! Rest assured, our "Elf Crew" will do their part to get your packages shipped and into your hands as quickly as possible.
We appreciate your patronage and wish you and your family all the best this holiday season.
Happy Holidays from the Fat Brain family!
