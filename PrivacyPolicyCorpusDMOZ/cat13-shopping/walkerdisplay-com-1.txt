General Privacy Policy
User Provided Information
Walker Display is the sole owner of the information collected on walkerdisplay.com. Walker Display collects information from users on our order pages and newsletter sign up. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and payment information (such as credit card number, expiration date). No sensitive payment information such as credit numbers are stored on our server.
Other Information Collection
We store information that we collect through cookies and log files. This information may be used in aggregate to improve the content of our site.
Communications from Walker Display
We send all customers an email receipt of their order. Customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter via email. There is an easily used opt-out method to stop receiving these emails. We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account or orders.
Sharing of Information
All personally identifiable information collected, including email addresses, will be kept in strict confidence and will never be given, shared, rented, leased or sold to any third party without prior consent. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.
Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our web pages ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and transmitted via high-grade SSL encryption software.
