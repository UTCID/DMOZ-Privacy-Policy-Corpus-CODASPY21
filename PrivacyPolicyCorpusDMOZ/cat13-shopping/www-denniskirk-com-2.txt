Why is the online price different than what is shown in the printed catalog?
Prices on certain items may change in the interim of our catalog being printed. Our sales staff will
inform you of any price change that may have occurred when you are placing your order. If an item's
correct price is lower than our stated price, you will be charged the lower amount. If the price is
higher than our stated price, we will contact you for instructions before shipping.
What is the procedure for returning a part?
You may return any unused and unaltered item(s) within 90 days for an exchange or a refund. Authorization
is not needed, however, a call to our Customer Service Department 800-969-7501 or Technical Support
Department may help you avoid an unnecessary return. Technical Support can be reached at the following
phone numbers:
Snowmobile: 320-358-3409
Harley: 320-358-1914
Metric: 320-358-1915
Off Road: 320-358-3831
Please do not return goods to us C.O.D. Instead, you may use our quick and easy return process. Simply
complete your Merchandise Return Form and enclose it with the items you wish to return in a secure
package, apply the Authorized Return Label (ARS Label) to the package and take the package to any
UPS Store®, Customer Center, Shipping Outlet, Drop Box or give it to any UPS driver. Keep the tracking
number strip located on the lower portion of the ARS/Return Label for reference when tracking your
package.
How to Properly Return an Item
Step 1
Take the item you'd like to return and securely place it into the original package.
Step 2
Fill out the merchandise return form on the invoice and enclose that into the package as well.
Step 3
With the package prepared to ship, apply the supplied *UPS ARS/return label onto the package.
Note: Keep the Tracking number portion of the label for reference. Also, be sure to fill out the
ARS return label with your name, address and ZIP code.
Step 4
Take the package to any UPS Store®, Customer Center, Shipping Outlet, Drop Box or give it to any UPS
driver.
Note: The UPS ARS/return label only applies to shipping addresses in the contiguous United States.
You pay nothing up-front. $7.99 will be deducted from your refund or exchange. No restocking charge applies
if returned within 90 days ($9.99 or 10% fee, whichever is higher, after 90 days). For items which
include a manufacturer's warranty, please follow their instructions. If warranty information was
not included, you may check to see if warranty information is available by searching for the part
number and looking for the warranty tab.
If you choose not to use the supplied ARS label, please return items using your preferred shipping carrier.
You will not be charged the $7.99 ARS fee since postage will then be pre-paid. Send packages to:
Dennis Kirk
955 S Frandsen Ave
Rush City, MN 55069
How soon will my return be processed?
All returned packages are opened the same day they are received.
Standard refund or exchange requests are processed the same day as well.
If you request an exchange the order should be processed and on its way back to you the next day.
If you request a refund, a refund will be issued to the original payment method the next business
day.
In some instances it may be necessary to contact you regarding your return, please provide a contact
number or email address.
What if my package is damaged or merchandise is missing?
Dennis Kirk takes every effort to ensure your package arrives in satisfactory condition. If your package
is damaged please call our Customer Service Department immediately 800-969-7501. Do not discard the
shipping carton until you have spoken with a representative.
