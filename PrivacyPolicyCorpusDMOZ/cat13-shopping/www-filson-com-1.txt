Protecting your order information is important to us and we do so by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information collected from the Site.

To confirm whether your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), the SSL is active and your information is secure.
If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to our server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please call us at 1-800-624-0201 and we would be happy to help you by telephone.
