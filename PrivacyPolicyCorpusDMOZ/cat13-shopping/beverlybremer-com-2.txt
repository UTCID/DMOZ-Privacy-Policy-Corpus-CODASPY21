Terms of Sale of Goods and/or Services
Thank you for choosing Beverly Bremer's Silver Shop, Inc.! This document
sets forth the terms and conditions for online sales of goods through
www.BeverlyBremer.com
(the "Site") and sets forth your rights and obligations as well as
certain conditions, limitations and exclusions that might apply to the
sale. If you have any questions, please contact us at
sterlingsilver@beverlybremer.com
.
First off, by placing an order through the website, you affirm that you are
of legal age to enter into this Agreement and agree to by bound by these
terms and conditions.
These terms and conditions (these "Terms") may be updated
by Beverly Bremer Silver Shop, Inc. (referred to as "us",
"we", or "our" as the context may
require. Any changes to the Terms will be in effect as of the "Last Updated
Date" referenced on the Site. You should review these Terms prior to
purchasing any product or services that are available through this Site.
Your continued use of this Site after the "Last Updated Date" will
constitute your acceptance of and agreement to such changes.
Second, these Terms are an integral part of the Website Terms of Use that
apply generally to the use of our Site. You should also carefully review
our Privacy Policy before placing an order for products or services through
this Site (see Section 9). We take your privacy very seriously and do not
share your information with third parties except for very limited reasons
as set forth in the Privacy Policy and do not share your information with
third party advertisers.
1.
Order Acceptance and Cancellation.
By placing an order through the Site, you are making an offer to buy,
under these Terms, all products and services listed in your on-line
shopping bag. Once you have made an order, we must still accept the
offer or we will not be obligated to sell the products to you. We may
choose not to accept orders, even after we send you a confirmation
email with your order number and details of the items you have ordered.
2.
Prices and Payment Terms.
(a)
Prices posted on this Site may be different than prices offered by
us at our retail location located at 3164 Peachtree Road, Atlanta,
Georgia 30305. All prices, discounts, and promotions posted on this
Site are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a
product or service will be the price in effect at the time the
order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation
email. Price increases will only apply to orders placed after such
changes. Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping
and handling. All such taxes and charges will be added to your
merchandise total, and will be itemized in your shopping cart and
in your order confirmation email. We strive to display accurate
price information, however we may, on occasion, make inadvertent
typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing
and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors,
inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any orders
arising from such occurrences.
(b)
We may offer from time to time promotions on the Site that may
affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions
separate from these Terms. If there is a conflict between the terms
for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern.
(c)
Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and payment must be
received by us before our acceptance of an order. We accept
Visa®, Mastercard®, American Express® and
Discover® for all purchases. You represent and warrant that
(i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct
and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card
for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by
your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by
you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges
and all applicable taxes, if any, regardless of the amount quoted
on the Site at the time of your order.
3.
Shipments; Delivery; Title and Risk of Loss.
(a)
We will arrange for shipment of the products to you. Please check
the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will
pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering
process. Shipping and handling charges are reimbursement for the
costs we incur in the processing, handling, packing, shipping, and
delivery of your order.
(b)
Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the
products to the carrier. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates
only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in
shipments.
4.
Returns and Refunds.
Except for custom-made or personalized items or any other products
designated on the Site as final sale or non-returnable, we will accept
a return of the products for a refund of your purchase price, less the
original shipping and handling costs, provided such return is made
within 60 days of shipment with valid proof of purchase. Alternatively,
for any returns made within 90 days of shipment, we will issue a store
credit for your purchase price, less the original shipping and handling
costs. In order to receive a refund of your purchase price or store
credit, the products must be returned in their original, unused and
salable condition. To return products, you must call (404) 261-4009 or
email our returns department at sterlingsilver@beverlybremer.com before
shipping your product.
You are responsible for all shipping and handling charges on returned items
unless we have agreed to pay these costs in advance in a written
communication. You bear the risk of loss during shipment. We therefore
strongly recommend that you fully insure your return shipment against loss
or damage and that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of
delivery for your protection.
Refunds are processed within approximately five business days of our
receipt of your merchandise. Your refund will be credited back to the same
payment method used to make the original purchase on the Site.

9.
Force Majeure.
We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have
defaulted or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in our

reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood,
fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or
hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or
acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution,
insurrection, epidemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes

adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication
breakdown or power outage.
10.
Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
This Site is operated from the US. All matters arising out of or
relating to these Terms are governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of Georgia without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Georgia or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of
Georgia.
11.
Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration.
(a)
YOU AND BEVERLY BREMER SILVER SHOP, INC. ARE AGREEING TO GIVE
UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY,
OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION
WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF
YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN
ARBITRATION.
ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING
STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT,
INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING FROM OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH
THE SITE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING
ARBITRATION.
(b)
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") in accordance with the
Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then
in effect, except as modified by this Section 12. (The AAA Rules
are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
interpretation and enforcement of this section.
The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration
provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge
that the arbitration provision or the agreement is void, voidable, or
otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever
relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the
arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be
entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys'
fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards
for fee shifting provided by law.
(c)
You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute,
NEITHER YOU NOR BEVERLY BREMER SILVER SHOP, INC. WILL BE
ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER
CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE
IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY
. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no
power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration
waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only
be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the
unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms
will be enforced.
12.
Assignment.
You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your
obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any
purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 13 is
null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your
obligations under these Terms.
13.
No Waivers.
The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or
provision. The waiver of any right or provision will be effective only
if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Beverly
Bremer Silver Shop, Inc..
14.
No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than you.
15.
Notices.
(a)
To You. We may provide any notice to you under these Terms by: (i)
sending a message to the email address you provide or (ii) by
posting to the Site. Notices sent by email will be effective when
we send the email and notices we provide by posting will be
effective upon posting. It is your responsibility to keep your
email address current.
(b)

follows: (i) by facsimile transmission to (404) 261-9708; or (ii)
by personal delivery, overnight courier, or registered or certified
mail to Beverly Bremer Silver Shop, Inc., 3164 Peachtree Rd.,
Atlanta, Georgia 30305. We may update the facsimile number or
address for notices to us by posting a notice on the Site. Notices
provided by personal delivery will be effective immediately.
Notices provided by facsimile transmission or overnight courier
will be effective one business day after they are sent. Notices
provided by registered or certified mail will be effective three
business days after they are sent.
16.
Severability.
If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severed from these
Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of these Terms.
17.
Entire Agreement
. These Terms, our Website Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy will be
deemed the final and integrated agreement between you and us on the
matters contained in these Terms.
